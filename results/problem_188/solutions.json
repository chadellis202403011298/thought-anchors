Describe the step-by-step construction process you would follow. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I need to construct an equilateral triangle using only a compass and a straightedge, and I'm given one side AB of length 5 cm. Hmm, okay, I remember that constructing an equilateral triangle isn't too hard once you have one side, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact steps. Let me think this through carefully.\n\nFirst, I know that an equilateral triangle has all sides equal and all angles equal to 60 degrees. Since I have one side, AB, I need to find two more sides of the same length. I think the key here is to use the compass and straightedge to create circles that will help me find the correct points to complete the triangle.\n\nOkay, so step one: I need to draw a circle with center at point A and radius AB. That should give me a circle passing through point B. Similarly, I should draw another circle with center at point B and the same radius, which is 5 cm. The intersection of these two circles should give me the possible locations for the third vertex, C, of the equilateral triangle. \n\nWait, but how exactly do I find point C? I think the third vertex will lie at the intersection of these two circles, but there are two possible points where the circles intersect, right? So, I need to choose the one that forms a triangle with AB. Let me visualize this: if AB is the base, then point C should be above or below this base. Since the problem doesn't specify orientation, I can choose either one, but I'll go with the one above AB for consistency.\n\nSo, I'll proceed by drawing the two circles. The first circle is centered at A, radius AB. I'll place the compass at A, open it to 5 cm, and draw the circle. Then, I'll move the compass to point B, open it to the same 5 cm, and draw another circle. The point where these two circles intersect above AB will be one of the possible Cs. Let me mark that point as C.\n\nWait a second, I think I need to ensure that the angle at C is 60 degrees. But actually, by constructing the circles this way, the angle at C should already be 60 degrees because each arc corresponds to a 60-degree angle. Or is that correct? Maybe I should double-check that.\n\nI recall that in a circle, the angle subtended by a diameter is 90 degrees, but in this case, the radius is 5 cm, and the chord AB is also 5 cm. So, the angle at the center (angle AOB, where O is the center of the circle) would be 60 degrees because in a circle, the central angle corresponding to a chord of length equal to the radius is 60 degrees. That makes sense because in a regular hexagon, each side subtends a 60-degree angle at the center.\n\nSo, when I construct the two circles, the point C where they intersect will form a triangle ABC where all sides are 5 cm, making it equilateral. But wait, there are two intersection points. How do I know which one to choose? Well, one will be above AB and the other below. Since the problem doesn't specify, either should work, but I'll go with the one above AB.\n\nNow, I need to confirm that the triangle is indeed equilateral. Let me think: since all sides are constructed to be 5 cm, and the angles should all be 60 degrees because of the central angles. So, yes, that should do it.\n\nWait, but I should also make sure that I'm not making any mistakes in the construction. Let me go through the steps again to verify.\n\n1. Draw a circle with center at A and radius AB (5 cm).\n2. Draw another circle with center at B and radius BA (5 cm).\n3. Let these circles intersect at points C and D.\n4. Choose point C above AB as the third vertex.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Now, I can proceed to draw the triangle by connecting points A, B, and C.\n\nBut wait, I just realized that I might not have to construct the entire triangle, just the third side. Or does the problem ask for the entire triangle? Let me check the question again: it says \"construct an equilateral triangle given only one side AB of length 5 cm.\" So, yes, I need to construct the entire triangle, meaning I need to find points C and D (if necessary) and then draw all sides.\n\nWait, no, in an equilateral triangle, there's only one third vertex, so I just need to find point C. Then, connect A to C and B to C to form the triangle.\n\nOkay, so to summarize the steps:\n\n1. Using the compass, draw a circle centered at A with radius AB.\n2. Using the compass, draw another circle centered at B with radius BA.\n3. The intersection point above AB is the third vertex, C.\n4. Draw lines connecting A to C and B to C to complete the equilateral triangle.\n\nI think that's it. I should also make sure that my compass is set correctly each time, adjusting the radius to exactly 5 cm. Also, I need to ensure that I'm drawing the circles accurately without any slanting, which could throw off the construction.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the possibility of the circles not intersecting properly. But since AB is 5 cm, and both circles have a radius of 5 cm, they should definitely intersect at two points, forming a diamond shape with AB as the base.\n\nWait, but if AB is 5 cm, and the circles have radius 5 cm, the distance between A and B is equal to the radius, so the triangle formed by points A, B, and C will indeed be equilateral.\n\nI think I've got it. So, to recap, the construction involves creating two circles with radius equal to AB, centered at A and B, respectively, and then selecting the intersection point above AB as the third vertex of the equilateral triangle. Then, connecting the dots to form the triangle.\n\nI should also mention that this method relies on the properties of circles and equilateral triangles, where the central angle corresponding to the side length equals 60 degrees. This ensures that the triangle is equilateral by definition.\n\nAlright, I feel confident about this construction. Let's proceed to outline the steps clearly.\n</think>\n\nTo construct an equilateral triangle given one side AB of length 5 cm using only a compass and straightedge, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Draw a Circle with Center A and Radius AB**: \n   - Set the compass to 5 cm.\n   - Place the compass point at A and draw a circle. This circle will have a radius equal to AB (5 cm).\n\n2. **Draw Another Circle with Center B and Radius BA**:\n   - Keep the compass set to 5 cm.\n   - Place the compass point at B and draw another circle. This circle will also have a radius of 5 cm.\n\n3. **Locate the Intersection Point C**:\n   - The two circles will intersect at two points. Choose the intersection point that lies above the line AB. This point will be the third vertex, C, of the equilateral triangle.\n\n4. **Complete the Equilateral Triangle**:\n   - Use the straightedge to draw lines connecting points A to C and B to C. This will form the sides AC and BC, completing the equilateral triangle ABC.\n\nBy following these steps, you have successfully constructed an equilateral triangle with side length 5 cm using only a compass and straightedge.\n\nDONE."

Describe the step-by-step construction process you would follow. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I need to construct an equilateral triangle using just a compass and a straightedge, and I only have one side, AB, which is 5 cm long. Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, I remember that an equilateral triangle has all sides equal and all angles equal to 60 degrees. Since I only have one side, AB, I need to find two more sides, BC and AC, such that each is equal in length to AB, which is 5 cm. But how do I do that with just a compass and straightedge?\n\nI think the key here is to construct a 60-degree angle because if I can create a 60-degree angle with AB, then I can use the compass to mark equal lengths on both sides of the angle, resulting in the other two sides of the triangle.\n\nOkay, so let's start by drawing the given side AB. Now, I need to construct a 60-degree angle at point A. To do this, I recall that one method is to use the compass to create an arc that intersects the existing line AB at some point, then use that to create an equilateral triangle.\n\nWait, maybe I should recall the steps for constructing a regular hexagon because that involves 60-degree angles. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Alternatively, I think there's a specific construction for an equilateral triangle when you have one side.\n\nLet me visualize this. If I have AB as one side, I can place the compass at point A and draw an arc that intersects AB extended beyond B. Then, using that intersection as a reference, I can construct a 60-degree angle. Hmm, that sounds a bit vague. Maybe I should break it down more.\n\nFirst, I'll draw side AB. Then, with the compass, I'll set it to the length of AB (5 cm) and place the compass point at A. I'll draw an arc above AB. Now, I need to find a point C such that AC and BC are both 5 cm and angle ACB is 60 degrees.\n\nWait, maybe I can use the method of intersecting arcs. So, after drawing the first arc from A, I need to draw another arc from B that intersects the first arc. The point where they intersect should be the third vertex of the equilateral triangle.\n\nBut how do I ensure that the angle is exactly 60 degrees? I think the key is to set the compass to the same length as AB and use that to determine the position of point C.\n\nAlright, let's try to outline the steps:\n\n1. Draw the given side AB with length 5 cm.\n\n2. With the compass, set it to length AB (5 cm) and place the compass point at A.\n\n3. Draw an arc from A, above the line AB.\n\n4. Keeping the compass point at B, draw another arc that intersects the first arc drawn from A.\n\n5. The point where these two arcs intersect is point C, the third vertex of the equilateral triangle.\n\n6. Connect points A, B, and C to complete the triangle.\n\nWait, does this always result in an equilateral triangle? Let me think. If I set the compass to the same length as AB and draw arcs from both A and B, their intersection should form a triangle where AC = AB and BC = AB, making it equilateral. Also, the angle at A should be 60 degrees because the arcs are the same length.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the construction involves drawing two arcs of equal length from points A and B, and their intersection gives point C. Then, connecting the points gives the equilateral triangle.\n\nI should also consider whether the arcs need to be above or below the line AB. I suppose it doesn't matter as long as they are on the same side, but typically, constructions are done above the base.\n\nLet me double-check the steps to ensure I haven't missed anything. First, draw AB. Then, set the compass to AB's length, draw an arc from A. Then, from B, draw another arc of the same radius intersecting the first arc. Connect C to A and B.\n\nYes, that should work. I don't think I need to adjust for any angles or use any other techniques because the arcs will naturally form the 60-degree angle.\n\nSo, the step-by-step process is as follows:\n\n1. Draw segment AB of length 5 cm.\n\n2. With the compass, measure the length of AB and set the compass to that measurement.\n\n3. Place the compass point at point A and draw an arc that intersects the line AB at some point beyond B, but actually, wait, no, I should draw the arc above AB.\n\n4. Once the arc from A is drawn, place the compass point at B and draw another arc with the same radius, intersecting the first arc above AB.\n\n5. The intersection point of these two arcs is point C.\n\n6. Draw segments AC and BC to complete the equilateral triangle ABC.\n\nI think that's correct. I should also mention that this method relies on the property that the intersection of two arcs of equal radius from points A and B will form an equilateral triangle.\n\nAlright, I feel confident about this construction method. Let's lay it out step by step as the solution.\n</think>\n\nTo construct an equilateral triangle with the given side AB of 5 cm using only a compass and straightedge, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Draw the Given Side AB**: Begin by drawing the segment AB of length 5 cm.\n\n2. **Set the Compass to Length AB**: Adjust the compass to measure the length of AB (5 cm).\n\n3. **Draw an Arc from Point A**: Place the compass point at A and draw an arc above the line AB. This arc will have a radius equal to AB.\n\n4. **Draw an Arc from Point B**: Keeping the compass point at B, draw another arc with the same radius (5 cm) that intersects the arc drawn from point A above AB.\n\n5. **Locate the Third Vertex C**: The point where the two arcs intersect is the third vertex C of the equilateral triangle.\n\n6. **Complete the Triangle**: Draw segments AC and BC to connect points A, B, and C, forming the equilateral triangle ABC.\n\nBy following these steps, you have successfully constructed an equilateral triangle with side AB of 5 cm. \n\nDONE."

Describe the step-by-step construction process you would follow. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I need to construct an equilateral triangle using only a compass and a straightedge, and I'm given one side AB of length 5 cm. Hmm, I remember that constructing equilateral triangles with just a compass and straightedge involves some specific steps, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact process. Let me try to recall and work through it step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that an equilateral triangle has all sides equal and all angles equal to 60 degrees. So, if I have one side AB, I need to find points C such that AC = BC = AB = 5 cm. The challenge is to do this with just a compass and straightedge, without any markings or measurements.\n\nI think the first step is to draw the given side AB. That's straightforward\u2014just use the straightedge to draw a line segment between points A and B, making sure it's 5 cm long.\n\nNext, I believe I need to construct a perpendicular bisector of AB. A perpendicular bisector will help me find the third vertex C because it should be equidistant from A and B, which is essential for an equilateral triangle. To construct the perpendicular bisector, I can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the midpoint of AB:** Using the compass, I can set it to any width and draw arcs above and below AB from both points A and B. The points where these arcs intersect will help me draw perpendicular lines. The intersection of these arcs will give me two points that are equidistant from A and B. Connecting these points with straight lines will form the perpendicular bisector.\n\n2. **Construct a perpendicular line:** Once I have the midpoint M of AB, I can construct a perpendicular line through M. I'll use the compass to draw arcs above and below M, ensuring the arcs are the same radius. Then, I'll draw a straight line through M where these arcs intersect, forming the perpendicular bisector.\n\nNow, with the perpendicular bisector constructed, I need to find the point C such that AC = BC = AB. I think I can use the compass to measure the length AB and mark it from the midpoint M to find C.\n\nAlternatively, another method I've heard about involves creating a 60-degree angle at point A or B. Since all angles in an equilateral triangle are 60 degrees, constructing such an angle might help in finding the third vertex.\n\nWait, perhaps the most straightforward method is the one where after constructing the perpendicular bisector, I can use the compass to transfer the length AB to the bisector and find the intersection point C.\n\nLet me outline the steps more clearly:\n\n1. **Draw segment AB:** Using the straightedge, draw the given side AB of 5 cm.\n\n2. **Construct the perpendicular bisector of AB:**\n   - With the compass, draw an arc with center at A, radius greater than half of AB.\n   - Without changing the compass width, draw another arc with center at B, intersecting the first arc at point D.\n   - Draw a straight line connecting points A, D, and B. This line AD and BD are both equal because they are parts of the same arc.\n   - Find the midpoint M of AB by drawing a line from D perpendicular to AB. This is done by drawing arcs above and below AB from D, and then drawing a line through D where these arcs intersect, creating the perpendicular bisector.\n\n3. **Mark the midpoint M:** Once the perpendicular bisector is drawn, M is the midpoint of AB.\n\n4. **Construct a circle with center M and radius AB:** Using the compass, set it to the length of AB (5 cm) and draw a circle centered at M. This circle will have a radius of 5 cm.\n\n5. **Find the intersection point C:** The circle centered at M with radius AB will intersect the perpendicular bisector at point C. Use the straightedge to draw a line from M through the bisector, and the circle will intersect this line at C.\n\n6. **Verify the triangle:** Connect points A, B, and C to form triangle ABC. Since AC and BC are both 5 cm (the radius of the circle) and AB is also 5 cm, triangle ABC is equilateral.\n\nWait, does this method work? Let me double-check. If I construct a circle with center M and radius AB, then any point on this circle is 5 cm away from M. But since M is the midpoint of AB, AM is 2.5 cm. So, the distance from A to C would be sqrt(2.5\u00b2 + 5\u00b2). Wait, that's sqrt(6.25 + 25) = sqrt(31.25) \u2248 5.59 cm, which is longer than AB. That can't be right because AC should be equal to AB.\n\nHmm, I think I made a mistake there. Let me rethink this. If I construct a circle with center M and radius MB (which is 2.5 cm), then any point on this circle is equidistant from A and B. But I need the point C such that AC = BC = AB = 5 cm. So, perhaps I should use a different approach.\n\nOh, right! Instead of using the midpoint M as the center, I should use point A or B to draw arcs that intersect the perpendicular bisector at C. Let me correct that.\n\nHere's the correct method:\n\n1. **Draw AB:** Use the straightedge to draw segment AB of 5 cm.\n\n2. **Construct the perpendicular bisector of AB:**\n   - Draw arcs above and below AB from points A and B with the same radius.\n   - The intersection points of these arcs (let's say D) will help in drawing the perpendicular bisector.\n\n3. **Draw the perpendicular bisector:** Draw a straight line through D, which is the perpendicular bisector of AB.\n\n4. **Construct a circle centered at A with radius AB:** Set the compass to 5 cm and draw a circle centered at A, which will intersect the perpendicular bisector at point C.\n\n5. **Construct a circle centered at B with radius AB:** Similarly, draw a circle centered at B with radius 5 cm, which will intersect the perpendicular bisector at the same point C.\n\n6. **Verify the triangle:** Connect points A, B, and C to form triangle ABC. All sides should be 5 cm, making it equilateral.\n\nI think this makes more sense. By constructing circles from A and B with radius AB, they will intersect the perpendicular bisector at the same point C, ensuring that AC and BC are both 5 cm, thus forming an equilateral triangle.\n\nLet me visualize this. AB is 5 cm. The perpendicular bisector is drawn, and from A, I draw a circle that intersects this bisector at C. Similarly, from B, the same circle is drawn, and it also intersects at C. This ensures that AC and BC are equal to AB, so triangle ABC is equilateral.\n\nI believe this is the correct method. I might have confused the midpoint M with the center of the circle earlier, but now I see that using A and B as centers with radius AB is the right approach. This way, point C is correctly placed to form the equilateral triangle.\n\nSo, to summarize the steps:\n\n1. Draw segment AB with the straightedge.\n\n2. Construct the perpendicular bisector of AB by drawing arcs from A and B, then connecting their intersection points.\n\n3. Using the compass, draw a circle centered at A with radius AB, which will intersect the perpendicular bisector at point C.\n\n4. Similarly, draw a circle centered at B with radius AB, which will also intersect the perpendicular bisector at point C.\n\n5. Connect points A, B, and C to form the equilateral triangle.\n\nThis should give me the desired equilateral triangle with side length 5 cm.\n</think>\n\nTo construct an equilateral triangle with a given side AB of 5 cm using only a compass and straightedge, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Draw Segment AB:** Use the straightedge to draw the given side AB of 5 cm.\n\n2. **Construct the Perpendicular Bisector of AB:**\n   - Draw arcs above and below AB from points A and B with the same radius.\n   - Let the arcs intersect at points D and E.\n   - Draw a straight line through D and E, which is the perpendicular bisector of AB.\n\n3. **Draw Circles from A and B:**\n   - Set the compass to 5 cm (the length of AB).\n   - Draw a circle centered at A, which will intersect the perpendicular bisector at point C.\n   - Draw another circle centered at B, which will also intersect the perpendicular bisector at point C.\n\n4. **Form the Equilateral Triangle:**\n   - Connect points A, B, and C to form triangle ABC.\n   - Since AC and BC are both 5 cm (the radius of the circles), triangle ABC is equilateral.\n\nDONE."

Those points should be the two possible locations for the third vertex of the equilateral triangle. So, if I draw both circles, their intersection points will be equidistant from both A and B, which is exactly what I need for point C.\n\nBut how do I ensure that the sides AC and BC are both 5 cm? By constructing the circles this way, the distance from A to any point on the first circle is 5 cm, and from B to any point on the second circle is 5 cm. So, the intersection points will satisfy both conditions, making AC and BC both 5 cm.

Describe the step-by-step construction process you would follow. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this problem where I need to construct an equilateral triangle using just a compass and a straightedge. The given side is AB, which is 5 cm long. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that an equilateral triangle has all sides equal and all angles equal to 60 degrees. Since I have one side, AB, I need to find the other two sides, BC and AC, each of the same length as AB. But how do I do that with just a compass and straightedge?\n\nI think the key here is to use the concept of perpendicular bisectors. If I can construct a perpendicular bisector of AB, it should help me find the third vertex of the triangle. Let me visualize this. If I draw AB on paper, then the midpoint of AB would be crucial. Once I have the midpoint, I can use the compass to draw a circle with a radius equal to half of AB. \n\nWait, no, that's for constructing a median or something else. Maybe I need to construct a circle with center at the midpoint of AB and radius equal to AB itself. That should give me a circle where the third vertex of the equilateral triangle lies. Then, I can draw another circle from point A or B to find the intersection point.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Draw segment AB with the given length of 5 cm.\n2. Find the midpoint of AB. To do this, I can draw a perpendicular line from AB using the compass. But since I don't have a ruler that can draw perpendicular lines directly, I'll use the compass to create arcs that help me find the midpoint.\n3. Once the midpoint is found, let's call it M. Now, with the compass, I can set it to the full length of AB (5 cm) and draw a circle centered at M.\n4. Similarly, I can draw another circle centered at A with the same radius, but that might not help. Wait, no, maybe I should only draw one circle centered at M with radius AB. Then, the point where this circle intersects the original segment AB is the midpoint.\n5. After getting the midpoint M, I need to construct a perpendicular line at M. How do I do that? I think I can create an equilateral triangle on one side to get a perpendicular. For example, construct a small equilateral triangle on AB, and the height of that triangle will be the perpendicular bisector.\n6. Once I have the perpendicular bisector, I can use the compass to draw arcs from points A and B on this line. The intersection of these arcs should give me the third vertex, let's call it C.\n7. Then, by connecting the points, I should have an equilateral triangle ABC.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Maybe I should recall the classic construction method for an equilateral triangle. I think it involves creating a 60-degree angle, which can be done by bisecting a 120-degree angle. But since I don't have a protractor, I need to construct that angle using only compass and straightedge.\n\nSo, perhaps the steps are:\n\n1. Draw AB.\n2. Find the midpoint M of AB.\n3. Draw a circle centered at M with radius AB; let it intersect AB at M (which is the same point, so that doesn't help). Hmm, maybe I need to extend beyond AB.\n\nWait, no, if I draw a circle centered at M with radius AB, it will pass through both A and B. But I need a point C such that AC = BC = AB. So, point C must lie somewhere on the circle centered at M with radius AB. But since AB is a side, C should be above AB, forming the triangle.\n\nAlternatively, another method is to construct a perpendicular bisector of AB, and then use the compass to find C such that AC = BC = AB.\n\nLet me try to detail each step more carefully:\n\n1. **Draw Segment AB**: Using the straightedge, draw a straight line segment AB of length 5 cm.\n\n2. **Find Midpoint M of AB**:\n   - With compass, measure the length of AB (5 cm) and draw an arc with center at A, radius AB, intersecting the extension of AB beyond B.\n   - Similarly, draw an arc with center at B, radius AB, intersecting the extension beyond A.\n   - The intersection point of these two arcs is point C, forming triangle ABC. Wait, but that's not the midpoint. Maybe I'm mixing things up.\n\nWait, perhaps to find the midpoint, I can use the method where I draw two arcs: one centered at A and one at B, both with radius AB. The intersection point of these arcs will be the midpoint M.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. If I draw arcs from A and B with radius AB, they will intersect above AB, forming an equilateral triangle. But that's not the midpoint. The midpoint is on AB, so maybe I should adjust the arcs to intersect on AB.\n\nAlternatively, to find the midpoint, I can use the following steps:\n\n- Draw arc centered at A, radius AB, intersecting AB extended beyond B.\n- Draw arc centered at B, radius BA, intersecting AB extended beyond A.\n- The intersection point is C, forming equilateral triangle ABC. Then, the midpoint M is the point where the medians intersect, which is at the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me recall the correct steps:\n\n1. **Draw AB**: Straight line segment of 5 cm.\n\n2. **Construct the Perpendicular Bisector of AB**:\n   - With compass, draw an arc above AB with center at A, radius AB.\n   - Draw another arc above AB with center at B, radius BA.\n   - The intersection point of these two arcs is point C, forming an equilateral triangle ABC.\n   - Now, the line AC and BC are equal to AB, and angle at C is 60 degrees.\n\nWait, but that's constructing the equilateral triangle, but how do I find the midpoint? Maybe after constructing point C, I can find the midpoint by drawing a line from C perpendicular to AB.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the method where I construct two circles:\n\n- Circle centered at A with radius AB.\n- Circle centered at B with radius BA.\n- The intersection points are C and another point, which is the reflection of C over AB.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that helps with the midpoint.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the method where I construct a 60-degree angle at point A or B.\n\nAnother approach:\n\n1. Draw AB.\n\n2. With compass, draw an arc above AB with center at A, radius AB.\n\n3. Similarly, draw an arc above AB with center at B, radius BA.\n\n4. The intersection point of these two arcs is point C, forming an equilateral triangle ABC.\n\nWait, that seems to work. So, by constructing two circles from A and B with radius AB, their intersection point C is the apex of the equilateral triangle.\n\nBut I'm not sure if I'm allowed to construct a circle with radius AB since I only have a compass that can measure existing segments. Wait, no, the compass can be used to transfer lengths. So, yes, I can set the compass to length AB and draw the arcs.\n\nSo, step-by-step:\n\n1. Draw segment AB with length 5 cm.\n\n2. With compass, set the width to 5 cm.\n\n3. Place compass point at A and draw an arc above AB, intersecting the plane.\n\n4. Without changing the compass width, place the compass point at B and draw another arc above AB, intersecting the previous arc.\n\n5. The intersection point of these two arcs is point C.\n\n6. Connect points A, B, and C to form the equilateral triangle ABC.\n\nWait, but is this correct? Let me visualize it. If I draw arcs from A and B with radius AB, their intersection is indeed the apex of the equilateral triangle. So, connecting them gives the triangle.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure if this is the correct method. Let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, another method is to construct a perpendicular bisector:\n\n1. Draw AB.\n\n2. Find midpoint M of AB:\n   - Draw an arc centered at A, radius AB, intersecting AB extended beyond B.\n   - Draw another arc centered at B, radius BA, intersecting AB extended beyond A.\n   - Let these arcs intersect at point C.\n   - Now, draw a line from C perpendicular to AB; this line is the perpendicular bisector of AB.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. The line from C is actually the median and altitude of the equilateral triangle.\n\nBut perhaps I need to find the midpoint by another method.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use the fact that in an equilateral triangle, the median, angle bisector, and altitude coincide.\n\nSo, if I can construct a 60-degree angle at point A, that would help.\n\nAlternatively, here's a method I found:\n\n1. Draw AB.\n\n2. Construct a circle centered at A with radius AB.\n\n3. Construct a circle centered at B with radius BA.\n\n4. Let these circles intersect at point C and another point; the other point is the reflection of C over AB.\n\n5. Connect points A, B, and C to form the equilateral triangle.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the steps are:\n\n1. Draw segment AB.\n\n2. Using compass, draw an arc with center A and radius AB.\n\n3. Using compass, draw another arc with center B and radius BA.\n\n4. The intersection points of these arcs are C and its reflection across AB.\n\n5. Connect A, B, and C to form the equilateral triangle.\n\nI think that's the standard method. So, in this case, point C is the apex of the equilateral triangle.\n\nBut wait, if I do that, does it ensure that AC = BC = AB? Yes, because each is constructed as a radius of the respective circles.\n\nSo, connecting the dots gives the equilateral triangle.\n\nI think that's the correct approach. So, summarizing the steps:\n\n1. Draw AB with length 5 cm.\n\n2. With compass, draw an arc centered at A with radius AB.\n\n3. With compass, draw an arc centered at B with radius BA.\n\n4. Let these arcs intersect at point C above AB.\n\n5. Connect A, B, and C to form the equilateral triangle ABC.\n\nYes, that should do it.\n</think>\n\nTo construct an equilateral triangle given side AB of 5 cm using only a compass and straightedge, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Draw Segment AB**: Use the straightedge to draw a straight line segment AB of length 5 cm.\n\n2. **Construct Arcs**:\n   - With the compass set to 5 cm, place the compass point at point A and draw an arc above AB, intersecting the plane.\n   - Without adjusting the compass width, place the compass point at point B and draw another arc above AB, intersecting the previous arc.\n\n3. **Identify Intersection Point C**: The intersection of these two arcs is point C, which is the apex of the equilateral triangle.\n\n4. **Form the Equilateral Triangle**: Use the straightedge to connect points A, B, and C, forming the equilateral triangle ABC.\n\nDONE."

End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: Using only a compass and a straightedge (unmarked ruler), construct an equilateral triangle given only one side AB of length 5 cm. Describe the step-by-step construction process you would follow. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem where I need to construct an equilateral triangle using only a compass and a straightedge. The given side is AB, which is 5 cm long. Hmm, I remember that in geometry, constructing an equilateral triangle involves creating all sides equal and all angles 60 degrees. But I'm not exactly sure how to do that step by step with just a compass and straightedge. Let me think through this.\n\nFirst, I know that to construct an equilateral triangle, one method is to construct a perpendicular bisector of one side and then use the compass to create arcs that intersect at the third vertex. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact steps, so I need to break it down.\n\nAlright, let's start by drawing the given side AB. Since AB is 5 cm, I'll make sure it's straight. Now, I need to find the midpoint of AB because the perpendicular bisector will pass through this point. To find the midpoint, I can use the compass by drawing arcs from both A and B that intersect each other. The point where they intersect is the midpoint, let's call it M.\n\nOnce I have M, the next step is to draw the perpendicular bisector of AB. To do this, I'll set my compass to a width that's a bit less than half of AB, maybe 2.5 cm, and place the compass point at M. Then, I'll swing arcs above and below AB from M. These arcs will help me draw a line perpendicular to AB through M.\n\nNow, I need to construct a circle with a radius equal to AB using point A as the center. I'll set my compass to 5 cm and draw an arc from A. Similarly, I'll do the same from point B. The intersections of these two arcs above AB will give me two points, say C and D. But actually, since AB is a straight line, these two arcs should intersect at two points symmetrically above and below AB. Let's pick one of them, say C, to be the apex of the equilateral triangle.\n\nWait, but I think I might be mixing up steps here. Maybe I should first construct the perpendicular bisector and then use the compass to find the third point. Let me try that again.\n\nSo after drawing AB and finding M, the midpoint, I draw the perpendicular bisector. Then, I use the compass to draw a circle from M with a radius equal to AB, which is 5 cm. This circle will intersect the perpendicular bisector at some point, which should be the third vertex, C. Then, I can connect the dots to form triangle ABC, which should be equilateral.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure if that's correct. Maybe I should verify. If I construct a circle with center at M and radius AB, then the intersection with the perpendicular bisector should indeed give me the third vertex. Because the distance from M to C should be equal to AB, ensuring all sides are equal.\n\nWait, no, that might not be right. Because the distance from M to C is AB, which is 5 cm, but the distance from A to M is 2.5 cm, so the distance from A to C should be 5 cm as well, making it an equilateral triangle. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I remember another method where you swing arcs from A and B to find the third point without the perpendicular bisector. So, after drawing AB, I can draw two arcs above AB from points A and B with the same radius as AB, which is 5 cm. The intersection point of these arcs is the third vertex C.\n\nWait, that makes sense too. Because the arcs from A and B with radius AB will intersect at a point that's equidistant from both A and B, forming a triangle with sides AB, AC, and BC all equal to 5 cm. So that should give me an equilateral triangle.\n\nBut I think the method with the perpendicular bisector is more precise because it ensures that the third point is directly above the midpoint, which is necessary for the triangle to be equilateral. The arcs method might also work, but I need to make sure that the arcs are correctly sized and that they intersect properly.\n\nAlright, so to summarize my thought process: I need to construct an equilateral triangle given side AB. The key is to find the third vertex such that all sides are equal. Using the compass, I can either construct the perpendicular bisector and then find the intersection point with a circle centered at M, or I can draw arcs from A and B with radius AB and find their intersection. Both methods should work, but the perpendicular bisector method might be more straightforward because it ensures the point is correctly placed above AB.\n\nI think I'll go with the arcs method first. So, step by step:\n\n1. Draw segment AB with the given length of 5 cm.\n2. Set the compass to the length of AB (5 cm).\n3. From point A, draw an arc above AB.\n4. From point B, draw another arc above AB, making sure the arcs intersect.\n5. The intersection point of these two arcs is the third vertex C.\n6. Connect points A, B, and C to form the equilateral triangle ABC.\n\nAlternatively, using the perpendicular bisector method:\n\n1. Draw segment AB of 5 cm.\n2. Find the midpoint M of AB by drawing arcs from A and B that intersect at M.\n3. Draw the perpendicular bisector of AB through M.\n4. Set the compass to 5 cm and draw a circle centered at M, intersecting the perpendicular bisector at point C.\n5. Connect A, B, and C to form the equilateral triangle.\n\nI think both methods are valid, but the arcs method might be quicker. However, the perpendicular bisector method is more precise and ensures the triangle is equilateral. I should probably use the perpendicular bisector method to avoid any mistakes.\n\nWait, let me double-check. If I use the arcs method, the distance from A to C is 5 cm, and the distance from B to C is also 5 cm, which makes triangle ABC equilateral. That seems correct. So, maybe both methods work. I'll go with the arcs method because it's simpler and doesn't require drawing the perpendicular bisector.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n1. Draw AB of 5 cm.\n2. Set compass to 5 cm.\n3. From A, draw an arc above AB.\n4. From B, draw another arc above AB, intersecting at point C.\n5. Connect A, B, and C to form the equilateral triangle.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me visualize it. If AB is 5 cm, and both AC and BC are also 5 cm, then all sides are equal, and all angles are 60 degrees. Yes, that makes an equilateral triangle.\n\nAlternatively, using the perpendicular bisector:\n\n1. Draw AB of 5 cm.\n2. Find midpoint M by drawing arcs from A and B intersecting at M.\n3. Draw the perpendicular bisector through M.\n4. Set compass to 5 cm and draw a circle from M, intersecting the bisector at C.\n5. Connect the points to form triangle ABC.\n\nEither way, the triangle should be equilateral. I think both methods are correct, but I'll go with the arcs method since it's more straightforward.\n\nWait, but I think the arcs method might not always give the correct point if the arcs are not drawn properly. Maybe the perpendicular bisector method is more reliable because it ensures the point is equidistant from A and B and at the correct height.\n\nLet me think again. If I draw arcs from A and B with radius AB, the intersection point C should form an equilateral triangle. Yes, that's correct because the distance from A to C and B to C is equal to AB, which is 5 cm.\n\nOkay, I'm confident now. I'll proceed with the arcs method.\n</think>\n\nTo construct an equilateral triangle given side AB of 5 cm using only a compass and straightedge, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Draw Segment AB**: Begin by drawing a straight line segment AB with a length of 5 cm.\n\n2. **Set Compass to AB's Length**: Adjust the compass to measure exactly 5 cm, the length of AB.\n\n3. **Draw Arcs from A and B**:\n   - Place the compass point at A and draw an arc above AB.\n   - Without adjusting the compass width, place the compass point at B and draw another arc above AB, ensuring the arcs intersect.\n\n4. **Identify the Third Vertex C**: The point where the two arcs intersect above AB is the third vertex C of the equilateral triangle.\n\n5. **Complete the Triangle**: Connect points A, B, and C with straight lines to form triangle ABC, which is equilateral with all sides measuring 5 cm.\n\nDONE."

Hmm, okay, let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, I remember that an equilateral triangle has all sides equal and all angles 60 degrees. So, if I can somehow create two more sides of the same length as AB, that should do it. But how do I ensure they're equal using just a compass and straightedge?\n\nI think the key here is to use the concept of circles. If I can draw a circle with center at one endpoint of AB, say point A, and have it pass through the other endpoint B, that gives me a radius equal to AB. Then, if I can find another point that's also 5 cm away from both A and B, that should form the triangle.\n\nWait, but how do I find that second point? Oh right, maybe I can construct a perpendicular bisector of AB. If I draw a circle with center at A and radius AB, then another circle with center at B and the same radius, their intersection points should give me the possible third vertices of the equilateral triangle. Let me visualize this: if I draw two circles, one centered at A and one at B, both with radius AB, they should intersect at two points. One of those points will be above AB, and the other below. Either of those points should form an equilateral triangle with AB.\n\nBut wait, is that always the case? I think so, because in a circle, the angle subtended by a diameter is 90 degrees, but in this case, the central angle would be 60 degrees because we're dealing with an equilateral triangle. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me recall: in a circle, the angle at the center corresponding to an arc is twice the inscribed angle. So if I have an equilateral triangle, each angle is 60 degrees, but the central angle would be 120 degrees, right? Because the inscribed angle is half the central angle.\n\nWait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me just stick to the basics. If I have two circles of radius AB centered at A and B, their intersection points will indeed form two equilateral triangles, one on each side of AB. So, I can pick either of those points as the third vertex C.\n\nOkay, so step by step, here's what I should do:\n\n1. Draw the given side AB of 5 cm.\n2. With the compass, set the width to 5 cm.\n3. Place the compass point at A and draw a circle; it should pass through B.\n4. Without changing the compass width, place the compass point at B and draw another circle.\n5. The intersection points of these two circles are the possible vertices C and C'.\n6. Connect either C or C' to A and B to form the equilateral triangle ABC or ABC'.\n\nWait, but I'm supposed to describe the construction process. Let me make sure I'm not missing any steps. Also, do I need to construct the altitude or something else first? Hmm, no, I think the circle method is sufficient.\n\nI should also consider whether the circles will intersect properly. Since AB is 5 cm, the distance between A and B is equal to the radius, so the two circles will definitely intersect at two points. That makes sense.\n\nIs there another method? I think there's another way using the perpendicular bisector. So, maybe I can also construct the perpendicular bisector of AB and then use the compass to find the third point. But I think the circle method is more straightforward.\n\nAlright, I think I've got the steps down. Let me outline them clearly to make sure I don't skip anything important.\n</think>\n\nTo construct an equilateral triangle given a side AB of 5 cm using only a compass and straightedge, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Draw the given side AB**: Using the straightedge, draw the segment AB of 5 cm.\n\n2. **Set the compass to 5 cm**: Ensure the compass is adjusted to exactly 5 cm, the length of AB.\n\n3. **Draw a circle with center at A**: Place the compass point at point A and draw a circle that passes through point B. This circle has a radius of 5 cm.\n\n4. **Draw another circle with center at B**: Without adjusting the compass width, place the compass point at point B and draw another circle.

These points are the potential vertices C and C' of the equilateral triangle.\n\n6. **Choose a vertex and connect the points**: Using the straightedge, connect point A to one of the intersection points (either C or C').

That means AC and BC should both be 5 cm, and each angle should be 60 degrees. I recall that one method involves creating a circle with center at point A and radius AB. Then, I can do the same with center at point B and radius BA. The intersection of these two circles should give me the possible positions for point C. But wait, I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Let me think more carefully.\n\nOkay, so step one: draw a circle with center at A and radius AB. That's straightforward with the compass. Then, draw another circle with center at B and the same radius, AB. The point where these two circles intersect should be point C. But wait, does this always work? If I draw two circles of equal radius from points A and B, they should intersect at two points, forming two equilateral triangles, one on each side of AB. So, I can choose either one, depending on which side I want the triangle to be on.\n\nBut I'm not entirely confident. Maybe I should verify this method. Let me recall: in an equilateral triangle, all sides are equal, and all angles are 60 degrees. If I construct circles around A and B with radius AB, the intersection points will indeed form two equilateral triangles. That makes sense because the distance from A to C and from B to C is equal to AB, which is 5 cm. So, triangle ABC will have all sides equal to 5 cm, making it equilateral.\n\nWait, but is there another method?

Depending on where point C is located, the triangle could be above or below the line AB. But since the problem doesn't specify, either position should be acceptable.\n\nLet me visualize this. If I have points A and B, and I draw two circles around each with radius 5 cm, the circles will intersect at two points. Connecting A to C and B to C will each be 5 cm, forming triangle ABC with all sides equal. The angles will naturally be 60 degrees because the circles are symmetrically placed around AB.\n\nI think I got it.

Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, I remember that an equilateral triangle has all sides equal and all angles equal to 60 degrees. So, if I can somehow create two more sides of equal length to AB, that should do the trick. But how do I ensure that the new sides are equal in length and form a 60-degree angle?\n\nI think the key here is to use the concept of circles and intersections. Maybe I can draw a circle with center at point A and radius AB. Then, do the same with center at point B and radius BA. The intersection points of these circles should help me find the third vertex of the triangle.\n\nOkay, let's break it down step by step.\n\nStep 1: Draw a straight line and mark point A on it. I'll set the straightedge to its maximum length, which should be at least 5 cm, to draw AB.\n\nWait, actually, since I only have AB, maybe I don't need to measure it again. I can just use AB as the radius for the circles.\n\nStep 2: Using the compass, set it to length AB (5 cm). Place the compass point at A and draw a circle. This circle will have a radius of 5 cm.\n\nStep 3: Without adjusting the compass, place the point at B and draw another circle. This should create another circle with radius AB, centered at B.\n\nStep 4: Now, these two circles should intersect at two points. One above the line AB and one below. I'll label these intersection points as C and D.\n\nWait, but in an equilateral triangle, only one of these points will form a 60-degree angle. The other point might form a 120-degree angle. So, I need to choose the correct one.\n\nHow do I determine which one is the correct vertex? Well, I think the one that's above the line AB is the one that forms a 60-degree angle, while the one below would form a 120-degree angle. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should check by constructing angles.\n\nAlternatively, I can construct another circle to find the correct point. Let me think.\n\nStep 5: After getting points C and D, I can draw a circle centered at C with radius CA. This should intersect the original circle at D, but I'm not sure if that helps.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to construct a perpendicular bisector of AB. If I can find the midpoint of AB and draw a perpendicular line, then the intersection of this bisector with the circle centered at A or B will give me the correct point C.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nStep 6: Find the midpoint of AB. I can do this by drawing a circle centered at A with radius AB/2, then a circle centered at B with the same radius, and their intersection will be the midpoint, say point M.\n\nStep 7: Draw a perpendicular line at M. To do this, I can construct a perpendicular line using the compass and straightedge. One way is to draw arcs above and below AB from M, then draw a line through the intersections of these arcs.\n\nStep 8: Now, the perpendicular bisector of AB will intersect the circle centered at A (or B) at point C. So, I can draw this bisector and mark where it intersects the circle; that should be point C.\n\nBut wait, I already have points C and D from the previous step. So maybe I can use the perpendicular bisector method to find which one is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can just pick one of the points, say C, and see if the distances AC and BC are equal. If they are, then it's a good candidate.\n\nStep 9: Measure the distance from A to C. If AC is 5 cm, then C is correct. If not, then D is the one I need.\n\nWait, but with just a compass and straightedge, I can't measure the distance directly. I have to rely on constructing it.\n\nSo, perhaps I can construct another circle centered at C with radius CA. If it passes through B, then AC = BC, meaning C is correct.\n\nBut I'm getting a bit confused here. Maybe I should stick to the initial method of drawing two circles and selecting the correct intersection point.\n\nAlternatively, there's a more straightforward method where you can construct the equilateral triangle in three steps: draw circles, find intersections, and connect them.\n\nLet me try to outline the process again.\n\nStep 1: Draw segment AB of length 5 cm.\n\nStep 2: With compass width set to AB, draw a circle centered at A.\n\nStep 3: Without adjusting the compass, draw a circle centered at B.\n\nStep 4: Let the two circles intersect at points C and D.\n\nStep 5: Choose one of the intersection points, say C, and connect C to A and C to B.\n\nStep 6: Verify if AC = BC. If they are equal, then triangle ABC is equilateral.\n\nBut since I can't measure, I have to rely on constructing congruent circles.\n\nWait, perhaps after drawing the two circles, the correct point is the one where the triangle is above AB. So, I can just connect C to A and B, and that should form an equilateral triangle.\n\nI think that's the method. So, the steps are:\n\n1. Draw AB.\n\n2. Draw circles centered at A and B with radius AB.\n\n3. Find their intersection points C and D.\n\n4. Choose C (or D) and connect to form triangle ABC.\n\nBut I need to ensure that ABC is equilateral. So, perhaps after connecting, I can check by constructing another circle or using the perpendicular bisector.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the fact that in an equilateral triangle, the altitude is also the median and angle bisector. So, if I construct the altitude from C to AB, it should bisect AB at a 60-degree angle.\n\nWait, maybe that's complicating things.

End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: Using only a compass and a straightedge (unmarked ruler), construct an equilateral triangle given only one side AB of length 5 cm. Describe the step-by-step construction process you would follow. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I need to construct an equilateral triangle given just one side AB of 5 cm using only a compass and straightedge. Hmm, okay. I remember that an equilateral triangle has all sides equal and all angles 60 degrees. But how do I go from just one side to the whole triangle?\n\nFirst, I think I need to find the third vertex, let's call it C. If I can construct point C such that AC and BC are both 5 cm, then ABC will be equilateral. But how do I find C?\n\nI recall something about the intersection of circles. Maybe I can draw a circle with center at A and radius AB, which is 5 cm. Then another circle with center at B and the same radius. The point where these two circles intersect should give me the possible positions for C. Wait, but circles with radius 5 cm from both A and B will intersect at two points. How do I decide which one to pick?\n\nOh, right! In an equilateral triangle, the height (altitude) can be calculated. Maybe I can find the height first and then use it to determine where C is. The height (h) of an equilateral triangle with side length s is given by the formula h = (\u221a3/2) * s. So for s = 5 cm, h = (\u221a3/2) * 5 \u2248 4.33 cm. That helps because it tells me how far C is from AB.\n\nBut how do I use this with just a compass and straightedge? I think I need to construct a perpendicular line from AB. So, step one: draw the given side AB. Step two: construct a perpendicular bisector of AB. To do that, I can draw a circle with center at the midpoint of AB and radius half of AB, which is 2.5 cm. The intersection points of this circle with AB are the midpoints. Then, using those midpoints, I can construct the perpendicular line.\n\nWait, maybe there's a better way. Instead of finding the midpoint first, I can just construct the perpendicular bisector directly. I'll place the compass at A, draw arcs above and below AB, then do the same at B. The intersection points of these arcs will help me draw the perpendicular bisector.\n\nOnce I have the perpendicular bisector, I can use it to find the height. So, I'll measure the distance from the midpoint of AB to C, which should be the height h \u2248 4.33 cm. But how do I transfer this height accurately with just a compass? Maybe I can construct a 30-60-90 triangle, since I know the ratios of the sides. In a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are in the ratio 1 : \u221a3 : 2. So, if I have a segment of length 5 cm (the side AB), I can divide it into two parts: one part as the shorter leg (1x), and the longer leg ( \u221a3 x). But wait, I need the height, which corresponds to \u221a3 x.\n\nWait, let me think again. If AB is 5 cm, then the height h = (\u221a3/2) * 5. So h = (5\u221a3)/2 \u2248 4.33 cm. To construct this length, I can use the compass to measure it from the midpoint. Alternatively, I can construct a right triangle with hypotenuse 5 cm and one leg 2.5 cm (half of AB), then the other leg will be h.\n\nSo, step by step:\n\n1. Draw the given side AB of 5 cm.\n2. Find the midpoint M of AB. To do this, draw arcs above and below AB with centers at A and B, intersecting at two points. The line connecting these two intersection points is the perpendicular bisector, and M is where it intersects AB.\n3. Using the compass, measure the distance from M to A, which is 2.5 cm, and mark a point N on the perpendicular bisector at this distance.\n4. Connect N to B, forming triangle AMN, which is a right triangle with legs 2.5 cm and h cm, and hypotenuse AB = 5 cm.\n5. Using the compass, measure the length h from N to the perpendicular bisector, which is the height of the equilateral triangle.\n6. Place the compass at M and draw an arc with radius h. The intersection of this arc with the perpendicular bisector gives point C.\n7. Connect points A, B, and C to form the equilateral triangle.\n\nWait, I think I might have skipped a step. After finding M, I should construct a perpendicular line at M. Then, using the compass, I can measure the height h from M to find C. Alternatively, I can construct a circle centered at A with radius AB, and another centered at B with the same radius, and their intersection point above AB will be C.\n\nYes, that makes more sense. So, perhaps the steps are:\n\n1. Draw AB.\n2. With compass, draw a circle centered at A with radius AB.\n3. Draw another circle centered at B with the same radius.\n4. Let the two circles intersect at points C and C'. C and C' are the possible positions for the third vertex.\n5. To determine which one to choose, I can check the distance from C to AB, but since both are equidistant, either one works. I can pick one, say C above AB.\n6. Connect A, B, and C to form the equilateral triangle.\n\nBut wait, do I need to construct the circles? Yes, because I can't just assume they exist. So, the detailed steps would involve constructing those circles.\n\nSo, to sum up, the process is:\n\n1. Draw segment AB with length 5 cm.\n2. Construct a circle with center A and radius AB.\n3. Construct a circle with center B and radius AB.\n4. The intersection points of these circles are C and C'. Choose one (say C) as the apex.\n5. Connect A, B, and C to form the equilateral triangle.\n\nI think that's it. I might have overcomplicated it initially by trying to find the midpoint and all, but the circle method seems straightforward.\n</think>\n\nTo construct an equilateral triangle given side AB of 5 cm using only a compass and straightedge, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Draw the given side AB**: Using the straightedge, draw a straight line segment AB of length 5 cm.\n\n2. **Construct a circle centered at A with radius AB**:\n   - Open the compass to the width of AB (5 cm).\n   - Place the compass point at A and draw a circle that intersects the line AB at two points.\n\n3. **Construct a circle centered at B with radius AB**:\n   - Without adjusting the compass width, place the compass point at B and draw another circle. This circle will intersect the first circle at two points, which are the potential positions for the third vertex C.\n\n4. **Identify the intersection points**:\n   - The two circles will intersect at two points. These points are equidistant from both A and B, meaning either can be used to form an equilateral triangle.\n\n5. **Select one intersection point as C**:\n   - Choose one of the intersection points above the line AB as point C. The other intersection point will be the reflection across AB.\n\n6. **Connect the points to form the triangle**:\n   - Use the straightedge to draw lines connecting A to C and B to C.\n\nBy following these steps, you have constructed an equilateral triangle ABC with all sides equal to 5 cm.\n\nDONE."
