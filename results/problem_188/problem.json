  "answer": "To construct an equilateral triangle given one side AB of length 5 cm using only a compass and straightedge, I will follow these steps:\n\n1. Draw a straight line segment AB with length 5 cm using the straightedge.\n\n2. Set the compass to the length of AB (5 cm) by placing the compass point at A and the pencil point at B.\n\n3. Without changing the compass width, place the compass point at A and draw an arc above the line segment AB.\n\n4. Without changing the compass width, place the compass point at B and draw another arc that intersects with the first arc. Label this intersection point C.\n\n5. Using the straightedge, draw line segments from A to C and from B to C.\n\nThe resulting figure ABC is an equilateral triangle. This construction works because:\n- The distance from A to C equals the length of AB (5 cm) since we used that radius for our first arc.\n- The distance from B to C also equals the length of AB (5 cm) since we used that radius for our second arc.\n- Therefore, all three sides of the triangle (AB, AC, and BC) are equal in length (5 cm), making it an equilateral triangle by definition."
