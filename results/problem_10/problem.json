  "question": "Sarah is at a picnic in the park and has brought a bottle of juice for herself. The juice is in a glass bottle with a metal cap that requires a bottle opener to remove. When she tries to open it, she realizes she forgot to bring a bottle opener. Looking around, she has the following items: a sandwich, a cloth napkin, a metal spoon, her car keys, and a park bench nearby. How can Sarah open her bottle of juice using only these available items?",
  "answer": "Sarah can open the bottle using her car keys as a lever to pry off the metal cap. Here's the reasoning process:\n\n1. Functional fixedness would lead us to think of the car keys only as tools for starting a car or unlocking doors.\n\n2. However, by thinking laterally, we can recognize that a key's rigid metal structure can serve as a basic lever.\n\n3. Sarah can place the edge of one of her keys under the rim of the bottle cap.\n\n4. Using the leverage principle, she can push down on the other end of the key, forcing the cap upward and off the bottle.\n\n5. Alternatively, she could also use the metal spoon in a similar way, by sliding the edge of the spoon under the cap and using it as a lever.\n\nThe key insight is overcoming functional fixedness by recognizing that everyday objects like keys or spoons can serve functions beyond their primary intended purpose. This allows Sarah to solve her problem with the tools at hand rather than being stuck due to the absence of a conventional bottle opener."
