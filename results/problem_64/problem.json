  "question": "A researcher claims: 'Some individuals possess an invisible energy field that brings good fortune to everyone around them.' Four statements have been proposed to test this claim. Which one of these statements would be most useful in determining whether the claim is falsifiable?\n\nA) 'Good fortune can be measured by increased rates of positive life events compared to the general population.'\nB) 'The presence of these special individuals causes measurable increases in lottery wins among their friends.'\nC) 'If the energy field exists, it operates according to principles beyond conventional science.'\nD) 'People with this special energy field can be identified by their charismatic personalities.'",
  "answer": "The correct answer is B.\n\nTo determine if a claim is falsifiable, we need to identify a statement that could potentially show the claim to be false if tested.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA) This statement only defines how to measure 'good fortune' but doesn't provide a specific testable prediction about the energy field claim. It's a necessary definition but not sufficient for falsification.\n\nB) This statement makes a specific, testable prediction: friends of these special individuals should win lotteries more often than others. We could collect data on lottery wins among friends of alleged 'special individuals' and compare with the general population. If no statistically significant difference is found, this would provide evidence against the original claim. This makes the claim falsifiable.\n\nC) This statement actually makes the claim less falsifiable by suggesting the energy field operates beyond conventional science, effectively shielding it from testing.\n\nD) This statement connects the energy field to personality traits, but doesn't provide a way to test whether the energy field actually brings good fortune to others. It shifts the focus to identifying the individuals rather than testing the claimed effect.\n\nOption B is the only statement that provides a specific, measurable prediction that could be tested and potentially shown to be false, thus making the original claim falsifiable."
