  "question": "A square piece of paper is folded once along a straight line, and a single hole is punched through both layers. When the paper is unfolded, which of the following patterns of holes is impossible to create? \n\nA) Two holes that form a horizontal line parallel to the bottom edge of the paper\nB) Two holes that form a vertical line parallel to the left edge of the paper\nC) Two holes that form a diagonal line from the top-left to the bottom-right of the paper\nD) Three holes forming a right triangle\nE) Two holes with different distances from the center of the paper",
  "answer": "The answer is D) Three holes forming a right triangle.\n\nWhen we fold a piece of paper once and punch a hole through both layers, we will always get exactly two holes when the paper is unfolded. These two holes will be symmetrically positioned on either side of the fold line.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA) Two holes that form a horizontal line: This is possible by folding the paper along a vertical line and punching a hole that isn't on the fold line.\n\nB) Two holes that form a vertical line: This is possible by folding the paper along a horizontal line and punching a hole that isn't on the fold line.\n\nC) Two holes that form a diagonal line: This is possible by folding the paper along the perpendicular bisector of the intended diagonal line.\n\nD) Three holes forming a right triangle: This is impossible because a single fold and punch can only create two holes. There's no way to create three holes with just one fold and one punch.\n\nE) Two holes with different distances from the center: This is possible by folding the paper along a line that doesn't pass through the center and then punching a hole.\n\nSince option D requires three holes, but our folding and punching can only create two holes, this pattern is impossible to create."
