  "question": "In a classroom of 25 students, each student is assigned a number from 1 to 20 (inclusive). Prove that there must be at least two students who are assigned the same number.",
  "answer": "This problem can be solved using the Pigeonhole Principle.\n\nStep 1: Identify the pigeons and the holes.\n- Pigeons: The 25 students in the classroom\n- Holes: The 20 possible numbers (1 through 20) that can be assigned\n\nStep 2: Apply the Pigeonhole Principle.\nThe Pigeonhole Principle states that if n items are placed into m containers, with n > m, then at least one container must contain more than one item.\n\nIn this case, we have n = 25 students (pigeons) and m = 20 possible numbers (holes).\nSince 25 > 20, by the Pigeonhole Principle, at least one number must be assigned to more than one student.\n\nStep 3: Draw the conclusion.\nTherefore, there must be at least two students who are assigned the same number.\n\nIn fact, we can calculate that there are at least \u230825/20\u2309 = 2 students who share at least one of the numbers, where \u2308x\u2309 represents the ceiling function (the smallest integer greater than or equal to x)."
