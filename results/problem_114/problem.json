  "question": "A small shop has two cashiers working at different registers. Customers arrive at random according to a Poisson process with an average of 12 customers per hour. Upon arrival, a customer joins the shortest queue (if both queues are the same length, they choose randomly). Each cashier takes an average of 4 minutes to serve a customer, and service times follow an exponential distribution. At a random point in the day during steady-state operation, what is the probability that a newly arriving customer will find both cashiers idle (no customers waiting in line or being served)?",
  "answer": "To solve this problem, we need to model the shop as a continuous-time Markov chain and find the steady-state probability of having no customers in the system.\n\nStep 1: Identify the key parameters:\n- Average arrival rate (\u03bb) = 12 customers/hour = 0.2 customers/minute\n- Average service rate per cashier (\u03bc) = 1/4 = 0.25 customers/minute\n- Number of servers (s) = 2\n\nStep 2: Compute the system utilization factor \u03c1:\n\u03c1 = \u03bb/(s\u00b7\u03bc) = 0.2/(2\u00b70.25) = 0.2/0.5 = 0.4\n\nSince \u03c1 < 1, the system is stable and will reach a steady state.\n\nStep 3: For a multi-server queue (M/M/s) system, the probability that there are no customers in the system (p\u2080) is given by:\n\np\u2080 = 1/[\u03a3(k=0 to s-1)((\u03bb/\u03bc)^k/k!) + ((\u03bb/\u03bc)^s/s!)\u00b7(1/(1-\u03c1))]\n\nSubstituting our values:\n- \u03bb/\u03bc = 0.2/0.25 = 0.8\n- s = 2\n\np\u2080 = 1/[((0.8)^0/0!) + ((0.8)^1/1!) + ((0.8)^2/2!)\u00b7(1/(1-0.4))]\np\u2080 = 1/[1 + 0.8 + (0.64/2)\u00b7(1/0.6)]\np\u2080 = 1/[1 + 0.8 + 0.32\u00b71.667]\np\u2080 = 1/[1 + 0.8 + 0.533]\np\u2080 = 1/2.333\np\u2080 = 0.429\n\nTherefore, the probability that a newly arriving customer will find both cashiers idle is approximately 0.429 or 42.9%."
