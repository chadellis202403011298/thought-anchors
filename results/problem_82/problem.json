  "question": "A square piece of paper has the letter 'F' drawn on one side, positioned in the center. If you hold the paper up to a mirror, what will the reflection of 'F' look like? Now, if you flip the paper over (without using a mirror), what will the 'F' look like from the other side? Finally, if you flip the paper over AND then hold it up to a mirror, what will the reflection look like? Describe each outcome clearly.",
  "answer": "Let's think through each scenario carefully:\n\n1) When you hold the paper with 'F' up to a mirror:\nThe mirror creates a horizontal reflection, which reverses the letter from left to right. The vertical stem of the 'F' will be on the right side instead of the left, and the two horizontal lines will extend to the left instead of the right. This creates a backward 'F': '\ua798'.\n\n2) When you flip the paper over (without a mirror):\nFlipping the paper over creates a different effect. The letter will be seen from behind, which means it will be reversed both horizontally and vertically. The 'F' will appear backward and also as if viewed from behind the page. It will look like: '\ua7fb' (a horizontally flipped 'F').\n\n3) When you flip the paper over AND then hold it up to a mirror:\nThis combines both transformations. First, flipping the paper creates a horizontally flipped 'F' ('\ua7fb'). Then, the mirror reflection horizontally flips this again. The two horizontal flips cancel each other out, resulting in the original 'F' orientation. However, the letter will appear fainter since you're seeing it through the paper and then reflected.\n\nThe key insight is understanding that a mirror reflection creates a horizontal flip, while turning a paper over creates both a horizontal and vertical reorientation of what's drawn on it."
