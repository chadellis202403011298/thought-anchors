  "question": "Consider the following sequence of shapes:\n\n\u25ef \u25b3 \u25a1 \u25ef \u25b3 \u25a1 \u25ef ?\n\nWhat shape should replace the question mark to continue the pattern?",
  "answer": "The answer is \u25b3 (triangle).\n\nStep 1: Identify the pattern in the given sequence.\nLooking at the sequence \u25ef \u25b3 \u25a1 \u25ef \u25b3 \u25a1 \u25ef ?, we can see that the shapes follow a specific order: circle, triangle, square, and then this pattern repeats.\n\nStep 2: Break down the existing pattern.\nThe pattern can be divided into groups of three shapes:\n- First group: \u25ef \u25b3 \u25a1\n- Second group: \u25ef \u25b3 \u25a1\n- Beginning of third group: \u25ef ?\n\nStep 3: Apply the pattern to determine the missing shape.\nSince each group follows the pattern (circle, triangle, square), and we already have the circle as the first element of the third group, the next shape should be a triangle (\u25b3).\n\nTherefore, the shape that should replace the question mark is \u25b3 (triangle)."
