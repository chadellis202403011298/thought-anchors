  "question": "A man walks into a restaurant and orders albatross soup. After taking one taste, he leaves the restaurant and commits suicide. Why?",
  "answer": "The man had been stranded on a deserted island with his wife and several other people after a shipwreck. During their time there, his wife died. One of his fellow survivors hunted and prepared what he claimed was albatross meat for everyone to eat. Eventually, they were rescued. Years later, the man visits a restaurant and orders albatross soup, curious to taste it again. Upon tasting real albatross for the first time, he realizes that what he ate on the island was not albatross at all. He deduces that they had actually eaten his wife's flesh, disguised as albatross meat. This horrifying realization drives him to suicide. This insight problem requires lateral thinking because the solution isn't directly derivable from the facts presented. You need to think 'outside the box' and consider what unseen circumstances could connect these seemingly unrelated events."
