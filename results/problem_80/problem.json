  "question": "A librarian needs to arrange five books on a shelf: a red dictionary, a blue novel, a green cookbook, a yellow atlas, and a purple poetry collection. The library has a rule that reference books (like dictionaries and atlases) cannot be placed next to each other. Additionally, the librarian wants books of complementary colors to be placed next to each other (red-green, blue-yellow, and purple-yellow are complementary color pairs). How can the librarian arrange the books to satisfy both conditions?",
  "answer": "To solve this problem, I need to consider both constraints simultaneously:\n\n1. Reference books (dictionary and atlas) cannot be next to each other\n2. Complementary color pairs (red-green, blue-yellow, purple-yellow) should be adjacent\n\nFirst, I'll identify which books are reference books:\n- Red dictionary (reference)\n- Yellow atlas (reference)\n\nThese two books must have at least one non-reference book between them.\n\nNext, I'll identify the complementary color pairs:\n- Red dictionary and green cookbook\n- Blue novel and yellow atlas\n- Purple poetry and yellow atlas\n\nI notice that the yellow atlas has two complementary pairs. This gives me flexibility in arranging the books.\n\nLet me start with one possible arrangement:\n\nIf I place the yellow atlas at one end, I need to place either the blue novel or purple poetry next to it (for complementary colors). Let's try the blue novel:\n\n[Yellow atlas] - [Blue novel] - ? - ? - ?\n\nNow, the red dictionary must be placed away from the atlas, so it can go in positions 3, 4, or 5. Since it needs to be next to the green cookbook (complementary colors), I'll place them together:\n\n[Yellow atlas] - [Blue novel] - [Red dictionary] - [Green cookbook] - [Purple poetry]\n\nBut this arrangement doesn't work because the purple poetry book isn't next to its complementary pair (yellow atlas).\n\nLet me try a different approach, starting with the purple poetry next to the yellow atlas:\n\n[Yellow atlas] - [Purple poetry] - ? - ? - ?\n\nThe red dictionary still can't be next to the atlas, so it must go in positions 3, 4, or 5. Placing it next to its complementary green cookbook:\n\n[Yellow atlas] - [Purple poetry] - [Red dictionary] - [Green cookbook] - [Blue novel]\n\nThis still doesn't work because the blue novel isn't next to its complementary (yellow atlas).\n\nI need to reconsider the placement. What if I put the yellow atlas in the middle?\n\n[Red dictionary] - [Green cookbook] - [Yellow atlas] - [Blue novel] - [Purple poetry]\n\nThis works! Let's verify:\n1. Reference books (dictionary and atlas) are not adjacent\n2. Red dictionary is next to green cookbook (complementary)\n3. Yellow atlas is next to blue novel (complementary)\n4. Yellow atlas is next to purple poetry (complementary)\n\nTherefore, the solution is: [Red dictionary] - [Green cookbook] - [Yellow atlas] - [Blue novel] - [Purple poetry]"
