End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: A librarian needs to arrange five books on a shelf: a red dictionary, a blue novel, a green cookbook, a yellow atlas, and a purple poetry collection. The library has a rule that reference books (like dictionaries and atlases) cannot be placed next to each other. Additionally, the librarian wants books of complementary colors to be placed next to each other (red-green, blue-yellow, and purple-yellow are complementary color pairs). How can the librarian arrange the books to satisfy both conditions? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I've got this problem where a librarian needs to arrange five books on a shelf. The books are: a red dictionary, a blue novel, a green cookbook, a yellow atlas, and a purple poetry collection. There are two main rules here.\n\nFirst, reference books, which are dictionaries and atlases, can't be placed next to each other. That means the red dictionary and the yellow atlas are both reference books, so they can't be adjacent. The other books are novels and poetry collections, which aren't reference books, so they don't have that restriction.\n\nSecond, the librarian wants complementary colors to be placed next to each other. The complementary pairs given are red-green, blue-yellow, and purple-yellow. So, red should be next to green, blue next to yellow, and purple next to yellow.\n\nWait, hold on. Purple and yellow are both in the list, so that pair can be placed together. But purple is a poetry collection, and yellow is an atlas, which is a reference book. So, putting purple and yellow together would satisfy the complementary color rule, but we also have to make sure they're not violating the reference book rule.\n\nLet me list out the books with their colors:\n\n1. Red dictionary (reference)\n2. Blue novel (non-reference)\n3. Green cookbook (non-reference)\n4. Yellow atlas (reference)\n5. Purple poetry collection (non-reference)\n\nSo, the reference books are red and yellow, and the non-reference are blue, green, and purple.\n\nThe goal is to arrange them so that:\n\n- Red is next to green.\n- Blue is next to yellow.\n- Purple is next to yellow.\n- Red and yellow are not next to each other.\n\nHmm, but wait, the complementary pairs are red-green, blue-yellow, and purple-yellow. So, blue needs to be next to yellow, and purple needs to be next to yellow. But blue is a novel, and yellow is an atlas. So, blue and yellow can be next to each other because only reference books can't be next to each other. So, blue (novel) and yellow (atlas) can be adjacent.\n\nSimilarly, purple (poetry) and yellow (atlas) can be next to each other, but purple is a non-reference, so that's okay.\n\nBut red (dictionary) and green (cookbook) need to be next to each other, and they are both non-reference, so that's fine.\n\nWait, but red is a reference book, and green is not. So, red can be next to green because green is a non-reference.\n\nSo, the challenge is to place these books in a way that satisfies all these adjacency requirements without violating the reference book rule.\n\nLet me try to visualize this.\n\nFirst, let's note that red cannot be next to yellow because both are reference books. So, wherever red is, yellow can't be immediately to its left or right.\n\nAlso, blue needs to be next to yellow, and purple needs to be next to yellow. So, both blue and purple need to be adjacent to yellow.\n\nBut yellow can only have two neighbors, so it can only be adjacent to two books. So, if blue and purple both need to be next to yellow, that would require yellow to have two neighbors, which is possible, but we have to arrange them in a way that yellow is in the middle, with blue on one side and purple on the other.\n\nBut wait, yellow is a reference book, and purple is a non-reference, so that's okay. Similarly, blue is a non-reference, so that's also okay.\n\nSo, perhaps the arrangement could be something like: [Blue] - [Yellow] - [Purple], with blue and purple on either side of yellow.\n\nBut then, yellow would have blue on one side and purple on the other, which satisfies the complementary pairs for blue and purple with yellow.\n\nAlso, red needs to be next to green, so we need to place red and green next to each other.\n\nNow, considering the reference book rule, red cannot be next to yellow, so red can't be adjacent to yellow. Therefore, red and green must be placed somewhere else, not adjacent to yellow.\n\nSo, let's try to sketch this out.\n\nLet me denote the books as R (red), B (blue), G (green), Y (yellow), P (purple).\n\nWe need to place them in a row, let's say from left to right.\n\nLet me try to place yellow in the middle, with blue and purple on either side.\n\nSo, Y is in the center.\n\nSo, positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.\n\nLet me try Y in position 3.\n\nSo, Y is in the middle.\n\nThen, B and P need to be on either side of Y. So, B in 2 and P in 4, or B in 4 and P in 2.\n\nLet's try B in 2 and P in 4.\n\nSo, positions:\n\n1: ?\n2: B\n3: Y\n4: P\n5: ?\n\nNow, we have to place R and G somewhere.\n\nR needs to be next to G, so they have to be adjacent.\n\nAlso, R can't be next to Y.\n\nSo, R can't be in 2 or 4 because Y is in 3.\n\nSo, R can be in 1 or 5.\n\nSimilarly, G can be placed in 1, 5, or somewhere else, but R and G need to be next to each other.\n\nIf R is in 1, then G has to be in 2, but 2 is B, so that's not possible.\n\nWait, no, because if R is in 1, G has to be in 2, but position 2 is B, which is blue. So, that's not possible because G can't be next to B unless it's a complementary pair, but G and B aren't complementary.\n\nWait, the complementary pairs are R-G, B-Y, P-Y.\n\nSo, G can't be next to B because they aren't complementary. So, G has to be placed somewhere else.\n\nAlternatively, if R is in 5, then G has to be in 4 or 6, but 6 doesn't exist. So, G would have to be in 4, which is P. But G and P aren't complementary, so that's not allowed.\n\nHmm, that's a problem.\n\nSo, maybe placing Y in position 3 with B in 2 and P in 4 isn't working because R and G can't be placed without violating the rules.\n\nLet me try placing Y in position 2.\n\nSo, Y in 2.\n\nThen, B and P need to be on either side of Y. So, B in 1 and P in 3, or P in 1 and B in 3.\n\nLet's try B in 1 and P in 3.\n\nSo:\n\n1: B\n2: Y\n3: P\n4: ?\n5: ?\n\nNow, R needs to be next to G.\n\nPossible positions for R: 4 or 5.\n\nIf R is in 4, then G has to be in 3 or 5. But 3 is P, which is non-reference, so G can't be next to P because G is non-reference, but the rule only prohibits reference books next to each other. So, G and P can be next to each other.\n\nWait, no, the rule is that reference books can't be next to each other, but non-reference books can be next to any other books, including other non-reference books.\n\nSo, G can be next to P.\n\nBut R and G need to be next to each other, so if R is in 4, G has to be in 3 or 5.\n\nIf G is in 3, which is P, but G and P aren't complementary, so that's not allowed.\n\nIf G is in 5, then R in 4 and G in 5. But then, R is in 4, which is next to Y in 2, but R is a reference book, and Y is also a reference book, so R can't be next to Y. So, R in 4 would be adjacent to Y in 2, which is a reference book, so that's not allowed.\n\nTherefore, R can't be in 4.\n\nWhat about R in 5? Then G has to be in 4 or 6, but 6 doesn't exist, so G in 4.\n\nSo, R in 5 and G in 4.\n\nNow, check adjacency:\n\n- R is in 5, next to G in 4. That's good because they are complementary.\n\n- R is a reference book, and G is a non-reference, so that's okay.\n\n- G is in 4, next to Y in 2? No, G is in 4, adjacent to 3 and 5.\n\nWait, G in 4 is next to P in 3 and R in 5.\n\nG is green, P is purple. They aren't complementary, so that's okay because the rule only requires complementary colors to be next to each other, not that non-complementary can't be.\n\nSo, that works.\n\nNow, check the reference book adjacency:\n\n- R is in 5, next to G in 4. G is non-reference, so that's okay.\n\n- Y is in 2, next to B in 1 (which is non-reference) and P in 3 (non-reference). So, that's okay because Y is a reference book, but it's only adjacent to non-reference books.\n\n- P is in 3, next to Y in 2 and G in 4. Both are non-reference, so that's fine.\n\n- B is in 1, only adjacent to Y in 2, which is non-reference, so that's okay.\n\nSo, the arrangement would be:\n\n1: B\n2: Y\n3: P\n4: G\n5: R\n\nLet me check the complementary pairs:\n\n- B (blue) next to Y (yellow): yes, that's a complementary pair.\n\n- P (purple) next to Y (yellow): yes, that's another complementary pair.\n\n- R (red) next to G (green): yes, that's the third complementary pair.\n\nAnd the reference books, Y and R, are not next to each other. Y is in 2, R is in 5, so they are separated by P, G, and Y's other neighbor is B, so that's fine.\n\nWait, but R is in 5, and G is in 4, which is adjacent to R. So, R is next to G, which is non-reference, so that's okay.\n\nI think that works.\n\nAlternatively, could there be another arrangement? Let me see.\n\nSuppose Y is in position 4.\n\nThen, B and P would be in 3 and 5.\n\nSo, Y in 4.\n\nThen, B in 3 and P in 5.\n\nSo:\n\n1: ?\n2: ?\n3: B\n4: Y\n5: P\n\nNow, R and G need to be placed.\n\nR needs to be next to G.\n\nPossible positions: 1 and 2.\n\nIf R is in 1, then G has to be in 2.\n\nBut then, G in 2 is next to B in 3. G and B aren't complementary, so that's not allowed.\n\nIf R is in 2, then G has to be in 1 or 3.\n\nIf G is in 1, then R is in 2, G in 1.\n\nBut G in 1 is next to R in 2. That's okay because they are complementary.\n\nAlso, R in 2 is next to Y in 4? No, R in 2 is next to B in 3 and G in 1.\n\nWait, R is in 2, adjacent to G in 1 and B in 3.\n\nR is a reference book, B is non-reference, so that's okay.\n\nBut R can't be next to Y, which is in 4, but R is in 2, so they are separated by B and Y's position.\n\nWait, R is in 2, Y is in 4. So, R and Y are not adjacent, which is good.\n\nSo, the arrangement would be:\n\n1: G\n2: R\n3: B\n4: Y\n5: P\n\nCheck complementary pairs:\n\n- R next to G: yes.\n\n- B next to Y: yes.\n\n- P next to Y: yes.\n\nReference books: R in 2, Y in 4. They are not adjacent, so that's okay.\n\nSo, this also works.\n\nAlternatively, Y in 4, B in 5 and P in 3.\n\nWait, let's try that.\n\nY in 4.\n\nB in 5 and P in 3.\n\nSo:\n\n1: ?\n2: ?\n3: P\n4: Y\n5: B\n\nNow, place R and G.\n\nR needs to be next to G.\n\nPossible positions: 1 and 2.\n\nIf R is in 1, G in 2.\n\nThen, R in 1 is next to G in 2. Good.\n\nG in 2 is next to P in 3, which is non-reference, so that's okay.\n\nR in 1 is next to G in 2, which is non-reference, so that's okay.\n\nSo, the arrangement would be:\n\n1: R\n2: G\n3: P\n4: Y\n5: B\n\nCheck complementary pairs:\n\n- R next to G: yes.\n\n- G next to P: not complementary, but that's okay.\n\n- B next to Y: yes.\n\nReference books: R in 1, Y in 4. They are not adjacent, so that's okay.\n\nBut wait, G is next to P, which isn't a complementary pair, but the rule only requires that complementary pairs are next to each other, not that non-complementary can't be next to each other. So, that's acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, if R is in 2, then G would have to be in 1 or 3.\n\nIf G is in 1, then R in 2.\n\nSo, arrangement:\n\n1: G\n2: R\n3: P\n4: Y\n5: B\n\nSame as before, which works.\n\nSo, there are multiple possible arrangements, but the key is to place Y in the middle with B and P on either side, and then place R and G either at the ends or adjacent to each other without violating the reference book rule.\n\nAnother arrangement could be:\n\nY in position 3, B in 2, P in 4, and R and G in positions 1 and 5.\n\nSo:\n\n1: R\n2: B\n3: Y\n4: P\n5: G\n\nCheck:\n\n- R next to G: R in 1, G in 5. They are not adjacent, so that's a problem.\n\nWait, that doesn't work because R and G need to be next to each other.\n\nSo, R and G must be adjacent, so they have to be next to each other in the arrangement.\n\nSo, if R is in 1, G must be in 2.\n\nBut 2 is B, which is non-reference, so that's okay as long as they are complementary.\n\nWait, but R and G are complementary, so yes.\n\nSo, arrangement:\n\n1: R\n2: G\n3: Y\n4: P\n5: ?\n\nWait, but then we have to place the other books.\n\nWait, no, because we have five books: R, B, G, Y, P.\n\nSo, in this arrangement:\n\n1: R\n2: G\n3: Y\n4: P\n5: ?\n\nWait, but we have only five books, so position 5 must be B.\n\nSo, 1: R, 2: G, 3: Y, 4: P, 5: B.\n\nCheck:\n\n- R next to G: yes.\n\n- G next to Y: G is green, Y is yellow. They aren't complementary, but the rule only requires that complementary pairs are next to each other, so that's okay.\n\n- Y next to P: yes.\n\n- B next to Y: yes.\n\nBut wait, R is in 1, next to G in 2. Good.\n\nG is in 2, next to R and Y in 3. G and Y aren't complementary, but that's allowed.\n\nY in 3 is next to G in 2 and P in 4: both are non-reference, so that's okay.\n\nP in 4 is next to Y in 3 and B in 5: both non-reference, so that's okay.\n\nB in 5 is next to P in 4: non-reference, so that's okay.\n\nBut wait, R is in 1, which is a reference book, and next to G, which is non-reference. That's okay.\n\nAlso, Y is in 3, next to G in 2 (non-reference) and P in 4 (non-reference). So, Y is a reference book, but only adjacent to non-reference books, which is fine.\n\nSo, this arrangement also works.\n\nSo, the key is to have Y in the middle, with B and P on either side, and R and G either on the ends or adjacent to each other without being next to Y.\n\nI think the first arrangement I found was:\n\n1: B\n2: Y\n3: P\n4: G\n5: R\n\nWhich works because:\n\n- B next to Y: complementary.\n\n- P next to Y: complementary.\n\n- R next to G: complementary.\n\nAnd R is in 5, not next to Y, which is in 2.\n\nAlternatively, the arrangement:\n\n1: R\n2: G\n3: Y\n4: P\n5: B\n\nAlso works because:\n\n- R next to G: yes.\n\n- G next to Y: not required, but allowed.\n\n- Y next to P: yes.\n\n- P next to B: not complementary, but allowed.\n\nAnd R is in 1, not next to Y in 3.\n\nSo, both arrangements satisfy the conditions.\n\nI think either would work, but the first one is perhaps more straightforward because Y is in the center with B and P on either side, and R and G on the ends.\n\nSo, to sum it up, the librarian can arrange the books as:\n\nBlue, Yellow, Purple, Green, Red.\n\nOr in positions 1-5: B, Y, P, G, R.\n\nThat should satisfy all the conditions.\n</think>\n\nThe librarian can arrange the books in the order: Blue, Yellow, Purple, Green, Red. This setup ensures that reference books are not next to each other and that complementary colors are adjacent. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Reference and Non-Reference Books:**\n   - Reference books: Red Dictionary (R) and Yellow Atlas (Y).\n   - Non-Reference books: Blue Novel (B), Green Cookbook (G), Purple Poetry Collection (P).\n\n2. **Determine Complementary Pairs:**\n   - Red-Green (R-G)\n   - Blue-Yellow (B-Y)\n   - Purple-Yellow (P-Y)\n\n3. **Place Reference Books Separately:**\n   - Ensure R and Y are not adjacent.\n\n4. **Place Complementary Pairs:**\n  "

End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: A librarian needs to arrange five books on a shelf: a red dictionary, a blue novel, a green cookbook, a yellow atlas, and a purple poetry collection. The library has a rule that reference books (like dictionaries and atlases) cannot be placed next to each other. Additionally, the librarian wants books of complementary colors to be placed next to each other (red-green, blue-yellow, and purple-yellow are complementary color pairs). How can the librarian arrange the books to satisfy both conditions? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I've got this problem where a librarian needs to arrange five books on a shelf. The books are: a red dictionary, a blue novel, a green cookbook, a yellow atlas, and a purple poetry collection. There are two main rules to follow. First, reference books, which are dictionaries and atlases in this case, can't be placed next to each other. Second, the librarian wants books of complementary colors to be placed next to each other. The complementary pairs are red-green, blue-yellow, and purple-yellow.\n\nOkay, let's break this down. I think the first step is to identify which books are reference and which are not. The red dictionary and the yellow atlas are both reference books. The blue novel, green cookbook, and purple poetry collection are likely fiction or non-reference books.\n\nNext, the complementary colors. Red and green go together, blue and yellow, and purple and yellow. So, we need to pair these complementary colors next to each other. But we also have to make sure that the reference books aren't next to each other.\n\nLet me list the books with their colors and types:\n\n1. Red Dictionary - Reference\n2. Blue Novel - Fiction\n3. Green Cookbook - Fiction\n4. Yellow Atlas - Reference\n5. Purple Poetry Collection - Fiction\n\nSo, we have two references: red and yellow. And three fictions: blue, green, purple.\n\nSince references can't be next to each other, they need to be separated by at least one fiction book. Also, we need to place complementary color pairs next to each other.\n\nLet me think about the complementary pairs:\n\n- Red (dictionary) should be next to green (cookbook)\n- Blue (novel) should be next to yellow (atlas)\n- Purple (poetry) should be next to yellow (atlas)\n\nWait, that's interesting. Both blue and purple want to be next to yellow. So, yellow can't be next to both, but since it's a single book, we need to arrange them in a way that both blue and purple are adjacent to yellow, but not next to each other.\n\nHmm, maybe yellow can be in the middle, with blue on one side and purple on the other. But then, that would mean blue and purple are both next to yellow, satisfying their complementary pairs, but they themselves are adjacent. Is that allowed? The problem doesn't say that fictions can't be next to each other, only references. So that's okay.\n\nBut let's see if that works. Let's try placing yellow in the middle.\n\nSo, if I have something like:\n\n[Blue] - [Yellow] - [Purple]\n\nThat way, blue is next to yellow (complementary), and purple is next to yellow (complementary). But blue and purple are both next to yellow, which is allowed because fictions can be next to each other.\n\nBut wait, we also have red and green as complementary. So, red needs to be next to green. So, where can we place red and green?\n\nWe have two references: red and yellow. So, red can't be next to yellow because both are references. So, red needs to be placed somewhere else, but it needs to be next to green.\n\nLet me think about the possible positions. Let's try to visualize the shelf as positions 1 to 5.\n\nWe need to place the two references (red and yellow) such that they are not adjacent. So, they need to be separated by at least one fiction book.\n\nAlso, the complementary pairs need to be adjacent: red-green, blue-yellow, purple-yellow.\n\nWait, but blue and purple both want to be next to yellow. So, yellow has to be adjacent to both blue and purple. That means yellow must be in the middle, with blue on one side and purple on the other.\n\nSo, let's try:\n\nPosition 1: Blue\nPosition 2: Yellow\nPosition 3: Purple\n\nThat way, blue is next to yellow, and purple is next to yellow. Now, we have positions 1-2-3 as Blue-Yellow-Purple.\n\nNow, the remaining positions are 4 and 5, which need to be filled with red and green, with red next to green.\n\nSo, positions 4 and 5. If we place green in position 4 and red in position 5, then red is next to green. That works. But we have to check if red is next to yellow. Wait, position 5 is red, and position 4 is green, so red is next to green, which is good. But red is at position 5, and position 4 is green, which is fine. However, position 5 is red, and position 4 is green, so that's okay.\n\nBut wait, position 3 is purple, and position 4 is green. So, purple is next to green, but purple and green are not complementary. That's okay because only the specified complementary pairs need to be next to each other.\n\nSo, let's see the arrangement:\n\n1: Blue\n2: Yellow\n3: Purple\n4: Green\n5: Red\n\nBut wait, red is at position 5, and green is at 4. So, red is next to green, which is good. But also, yellow is at position 2, and position 1 is blue, position 3 is purple. So, yellow is next to blue and purple, which is fine because blue and purple are both complementary to yellow.\n\nBut let's check the references. Red is at 5, and yellow is at 2. Are they adjacent? No, they are separated by position 3 (purple) and position 4 (green). So, they are not next to each other, which satisfies the first rule.\n\nWait, but position 4 is green, which is a fiction, and position 5 is red, a reference. So, that's fine because only references can't be next to each other, not fictions.\n\nBut let me check the complementary pairs:\n\n- Blue (1) next to Yellow (2) - yes\n- Yellow (2) next to Purple (3) - yes\n- Purple (3) next to Green (4) - no, but that's okay\n- Green (4) next to Red (5) - yes, because they are complementary\n- Red (5) next to nothing on the right\n\nSo, all complementary pairs are satisfied except for Purple and Green, which isn't required. So, that seems to work.\n\nBut wait, another possibility: maybe placing red and green somewhere else.\n\nAlternatively, let's try placing red at position 5 and green at position 4, which we did. Or maybe red at position 3 and green at position 4, but that would mean position 3 is purple and red can't be next to purple because purple is a fiction. Wait, no, purple is a fiction, red is a reference, so that's okay. But red needs to be next to green, so if red is at 3, green would have to be at 4, but then red is next to purple (position 3) and green (position 4). But that would mean purple is next to red, which is a reference, but that's allowed because only references can't be next to each other.\n\nWait, but let's see:\n\nIf we have:\n\n1: Blue\n2: Yellow\n3: Red\n4: Green\n5: Purple\n\nBut then, red is at 3, next to yellow at 2. Red is a reference, yellow is a reference, so they can't be next to each other. So, that's a problem. So, that arrangement is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe:\n\n1: Green\n2: Red\n3: Yellow\n4: Blue\n5: Purple\n\nBut then, red is next to green (good), but red is also next to yellow (bad). So, that's not allowed.\n\nAnother approach: Let's try to place red and green together, not adjacent to any other references except through fictions.\n\nWe have two references: red and yellow. So, they need to be separated by at least one fiction.\n\nSo, perhaps:\n\nPosition 1: Blue\nPosition 2: Yellow\nPosition 3: Green\nPosition 4: Red\nPosition 5: Purple\n\nBut let's check:\n\n- Blue (1) next to Yellow (2) - yes\n- Yellow (2) next to Green (3) - no, because yellow and green are complementary, but in this case, yellow is a reference and green is a fiction. Wait, but green is a fiction, so it's okay for yellow (reference) to be next to green (fiction). But the problem is, yellow needs to be next to blue and purple, not necessarily green. So, in this arrangement, yellow is next to blue and green. But blue is complementary to yellow, which is good, but green is not complementary to yellow, but it's allowed because green is a fiction.\n\nWait, but the problem says that complementary color pairs need to be next to each other. So, blue and yellow are complementary, so they need to be next to each other. Yellow and purple are complementary, so they need to be next to each other. Red and green are complementary, so they need to be next to each other.\n\nSo, in this arrangement, blue is next to yellow (good), but yellow is also next to green, which is not required. However, the problem is that yellow is a reference, and green is a fiction, so that's allowed. But the issue is that red is at position 4, which is next to green at 3. Red is a reference, green is a fiction, so that's allowed.\n\nBut wait, red is at 4, next to green at 3, which is good because they are complementary. Also, red is next to yellow at 2? No, red is at 4, and yellow is at 2, separated by position 3 (green). So, they are not adjacent, which is good.\n\nBut let's check the references: red is at 4, yellow is at 2. They are separated by green at 3, so they are not adjacent. That's fine.\n\nBut let's see if all the complementary pairs are satisfied:\n\n- Blue (1) next to Yellow (2) - yes\n- Yellow (2) next to Green (3) - not necessary, but allowed\n- Green (3) next to Red (4) - yes\n- Red (4) next to Purple (5) - no, but that's okay\n- Purple (5) next to nothing on the right\n\nWait, but purple is at 5, which is next to red at 4. Purple is a fiction, red is a reference, so that's allowed. But purple is supposed to be next to yellow. In this arrangement, purple is at 5, and yellow is at 2, which are not adjacent. So, that's a problem.\n\nSo, in this arrangement, purple is not next to yellow, which violates the rule. So, this arrangement doesn't work.\n\nSo, going back, the previous arrangement where blue is at 1, yellow at 2, purple at 3, green at 4, red at 5 seems to work better because:\n\n- Blue (1) next to yellow (2) - yes\n- Yellow (2) next to purple (3) - yes\n- Purple (3) next to green (4) - not necessary, but allowed\n- Green (4) next to red (5) - yes\n- Red (5) next to nothing on the right\n\nAnd references: yellow at 2, red at 5. They are separated by positions 3 and 4, so not adjacent. That works.\n\nBut wait, in this arrangement, red is at 5, next to green at 4, which is good. But red is also next to position 4, which is green, so that's okay.\n\nAlternatively, could we place red at position 3 and green at 4, but then red would be next to yellow at 2, which is a problem because both are references.\n\nSo, that doesn't work.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe place yellow at position 3, with blue at 2 and purple at 4.\n\nSo:\n\n1: Green\n2: Blue\n3: Yellow\n4: Purple\n5: Red\n\nLet's check:\n\n- Blue (2) next to yellow (3) - yes\n- Yellow (3) next to purple (4) - yes\n- Purple (4) next to red (5) - no, but red is a reference, so it's allowed\n- Green (1) next to blue (2) - no, but green is complementary to red, not blue\n- Red (5) next to nothing on the right\n\nBut wait, green is at 1, blue at 2. Green is a fiction, blue is a fiction, so that's okay. But green is supposed to be next to red. In this arrangement, green is at 1, red is at 5, so they are not adjacent. That's a problem.\n\nSo, this arrangement doesn't satisfy the complementary pair of green and red.\n\nSo, the previous arrangement where blue is at 1, yellow at 2, purple at 3, green at 4, red at 5 seems to be the best.\n\nLet me confirm:\n\n1: Blue\n2: Yellow\n3: Purple\n4: Green\n5: Red\n\nCheck the pairs:\n\n- Blue and Yellow: yes\n- Yellow and Purple: yes\n- Purple and Green: not required, but allowed\n- Green and Red: yes\n- Red and nothing: okay\n\nReferences: Yellow at 2, Red at 5. They are separated by positions 3 and 4, so not adjacent.\n\nSo, that works.\n\nAnother possible arrangement could be:\n\n1: Purple\n2: Yellow\n3: Blue\n4: Green\n5: Red\n\nBut let's check:\n\n- Purple (1) next to yellow (2) - yes\n- Yellow (2) next to blue (3) - yes\n- Blue (3) next to green (4) - no, but blue is a fiction, green is a fiction, so allowed\n- Green (4) next to red (5) - yes\n- Red (5) next to nothing\n\nReferences: Yellow at 2, Red at 5. They are separated by positions 3 and 4, so not adjacent.\n\nBut wait, in this arrangement, blue is at 3, green at 4. Blue is a fiction, so it's okay for them to be next to each other.\n\nBut also, blue is next to yellow (good), and purple is next to yellow (good).\n\nSo, this arrangement also works.\n\nWait, but in this case, purple is at 1, yellow at 2, blue at 3, green at 4, red at 5.\n\nBut let's check the complementary pairs:\n\n- Purple and Yellow: yes\n- Yellow and Blue: yes\n- Blue and Green: no, but allowed\n- Green and Red: yes\n\nSo, that works.\n\nBut also, in this arrangement, red is at 5, next to green at 4, which is good.\n\nBut another thing to consider is the order of the complementary pairs. The problem says that complementary pairs should be next to each other, but doesn't specify the order, so both arrangements are valid.\n\nSo, both:\n\n1: Blue\n2: Yellow\n3: Purple\n4: Green\n5: Red\n\nand\n\n1: Purple\n2: Yellow\n3: Blue\n4: Green\n5: Red\n\nare valid.\n\nBut let's check if there's another arrangement where red and green are in the middle.\n\nWait, another idea: Place red and green together in the middle, with their complementary pairs, and have yellow in the middle as well.\n\nBut that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe:\n\n1: Green\n2: Red\n3: Yellow\n4: Blue\n5: Purple\n\nBut let's check:\n\n- Green (1) next to red (2) - yes\n- Red (2) next to yellow (3) - no, because red is a reference and yellow is a reference, can't be next to each other.\n\nSo, that's invalid.\n\nAnother arrangement:\n\n1: Red\n2: Green\n3: Yellow\n4: Blue\n5: Purple\n\nBut red is a reference at 1, green is a fiction at 2, which is allowed because references can be next to fictions, but red and green are complementary, so that's good.\n\nBut yellow is at 3, next to green at 2 (good) and blue at 4 (good). But yellow is a reference, so can't be next to another reference. Wait, yellow is at 3, next to green (fiction) and blue (fiction), which is okay. But yellow is also next to red at 2? No, red is at 1, yellow is at 3, so they are separated by green at 2, so they are not adjacent. That's good.\n\nBut wait, red is at 1, next to green at 2 (good), and green is next to yellow at 3 (good). Yellow is next to blue at 4 (good), and blue is next to purple at 5 (good). So, let's see:\n\n- Red (1) next to Green (2) - yes\n- Green (2) next to Yellow (3) - yes\n- Yellow (3) next to Blue (4) - yes\n- Blue (4) next to Purple (5) - yes\n- Purple (5) next to nothing\n\nBut wait, yellow is at 3, next to blue at 4. But blue is supposed to be next to yellow, which is good.\n\nBut the problem is, red is at 1, a reference, next to green at 2, a fiction, which is allowed. But also, red is a reference, so can't be next to another reference. Since yellow is at 3, and red is at 1, they are separated by green at 2, so they are not adjacent. That's good.\n\nBut in this arrangement, yellow is next to green and blue. Yellow is a reference, so it's allowed to be next to fictions, but the problem is, yellow is supposed to be next to blue and purple. In this case, yellow is next to green and blue, but not purple. So, purple is at 5, not adjacent to yellow. So, that violates the rule.\n\nTherefore, this arrangement doesn't work because purple isn't next to yellow.\n\nSo, going back, the best arrangement is either:\n\n1: Blue\n2: Yellow\n3: Purple\n4: Green\n5: Red\n\nor\n\n1: Purple\n2: Yellow\n3: Blue\n4: Green\n5: Red\n\nBoth satisfy all conditions.\n\nWait, but in the second arrangement, purple is at 1, yellow at 2, blue at 3, green at 4, red at 5.\n\nSo, purple is next to yellow, yellow is next to blue, blue is next to green, green is next to red. All complementary pairs except blue and green, which is allowed.\n\nAnd references: yellow at 2, red at 5. They are separated by positions 3 and 4, so not adjacent.\n\nSo, both arrangements work.\n\nBut let's see if there"

    "solution": "Solve this problem step by step. End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: A librarian needs to arrange five books on a shelf: a red dictionary, a blue novel, a green cookbook, a yellow atlas, and a purple poetry collection. The library has a rule that reference books (like dictionaries and atlases) cannot be placed next to each other. Additionally, the librarian wants books of complementary colors to be placed next to each other (red-green, blue-yellow, and purple-yellow are complementary color pairs). How can the librarian arrange the books to satisfy both conditions? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out how to arrange these five books on the shelf. Let's see, the books are a red dictionary, a blue novel, a green cookbook, a yellow atlas, and a purple poetry collection. There are two main rules to follow: first, reference books (dictionaries and atlases) can't be placed next to each other. Second, complementary colors should be placed next to each other. The complementary pairs are red-green, blue-yellow, and purple-yellow.\n\nHmm, okay, so I need to make sure that dictionaries and atlases aren't adjacent. That means they need to be separated by at least one book. Also, complementary colors should be neighbors, so red should be next to green, blue next to yellow, and purple next to yellow. Wait, but purple and yellow are both mentioned as complementary. Is that right? Let me double-check: red-green, blue-yellow, and purple-yellow. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, first, I'll list out the books with their colors:\n\n1. Red dictionary (R)\n2. Blue novel (B)\n3. Green cookbook (G)\n4. Yellow atlas (Y)\n5. Purple poetry collection (P)\n\nNow, the complementary pairs are R-G, B-Y, and P-Y. Wait, that's interesting because Y appears in two pairs: B-Y and P-Y. So, Y is paired with both B and P. That might complicate things a bit because Y can't be adjacent to both B and P unless they are placed next to each other, but since B and P are different books, they can be next to each other, but we have to make sure that Y isn't next to a non-complementary color.\n\nWait, no, the rule is that complementary colors should be next to each other. So, Y should be next to both B and P. But that's not possible because Y can only have one neighbor on each side. Unless we arrange it so that Y is between B and P, making both B-Y and Y-P. That could work.\n\nSo, maybe Y is in the middle, with B on one side and P on the other. Let me try that.\n\nSo, if I place Y in the center, then B and P would flank Y. So, something like B-Y-P. But then, the other pair is R-G, which also need to be next to each other. So, R and G should be adjacent.\n\nBut we also have two reference books: R (dictionary) and Y (atlas). They can't be next to each other. So, if Y is in the middle, then R can't be next to Y.\n\nWait, but if Y is in the center, and R is on one end, then R can't be next to Y. So, maybe the arrangement is something like [R ... Y ... P ...], but I need to make sure that R is not next to Y.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can place Y between B and P, and then have R and G somewhere else. But R and G also need to be next to each other.\n\nLet me try to sketch this out.\n\nOption 1:\n\nStart with R, then G, since they are complementary. So, R-G.\n\nThen, we have Y, which needs to be next to B and P. So, maybe after G, we can place Y. But then Y would need to be next to B and P, but we have limited space.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nR-G-Y\n\nBut Y needs to be next to B and P, so perhaps:\n\nR-G-Y-B-P\n\nBut then Y is next to G and B. Wait, but Y also needs to be next to P. So, that doesn't work because Y is only next to G and B.\n\nAlternatively, maybe:\n\nR-G-Y-P-B\n\nBut then Y is next to G and P. But Y also needs to be next to B, which is not adjacent here.\n\nHmm, this is tricky.\n\nOption 2:\n\nLet's try placing Y in the middle, with B and P on either side.\n\nSo, B-Y-P.\n\nThen, we have R and G, which need to be next to each other. So, maybe R-G on one end.\n\nBut then we have to place the remaining books. Wait, we have five books, so positions 1,2,3,4,5.\n\nIf I place B-Y-P in positions 2-3-4, then:\n\nPosition 1: ?\n\nPosition 5: ?\n\nBut R and G need to be together. So, maybe R-G in positions 1-2, but position 2 is Y, so that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, R-G in positions 4-5, but position 4 is P, so that's not possible.\n\nWait, maybe R and G are in positions 1-2, but then position 2 is Y, which can't be next to R (since R is a reference book and Y is also a reference book). So, R and Y can't be next to each other.\n\nSo, that won't work.\n\nOption 3:\n\nLet me try to place R and G together, say in positions 1-2: R-G.\n\nThen, Y needs to be next to B and P, so Y needs to be adjacent to both B and P. So, perhaps Y is in position 4, with B in 3 and P in 5. But then Y is next to B and P, which is good. But then, what about position 5? P is a reference book, and position 5 is next to position 4 (Y), which is also a reference book. That's not allowed because reference books can't be next to each other.\n\nSo, that doesn't work.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe place Y between B and P, and then have R and G somewhere else.\n\nSo, let's try:\n\nB-Y-P\n\nThen, R and G need to be together, so maybe at the ends.\n\nBut if we place R-G at the beginning:\n\nR-G-B-Y-P\n\nBut then Y is next to B and P, which is good. R is next to G, which is good. Now, check the reference books: R is a dictionary, Y is an atlas. They are separated by G, B, and Y, so they are not adjacent. Good.\n\nWait, but in this arrangement, R is at position 1, G at 2, B at 3, Y at 4, P at 5.\n\nBut wait, G is a cookbook, not a reference book. So, the only reference books are R and Y. They are at positions 1 and 4, with G, B, and P in between. So, they are not adjacent. Good.\n\nBut wait, let's check the complementary pairs:\n\nR-G: Yes, they are next to each other.\n\nB-Y: Yes, they are next to each other.\n\nP-Y: Yes, they are next to each other.\n\nWait, but P-Y are next to each other, but P is purple and Y is yellow, which is a complementary pair, so that's good.\n\nSo, this arrangement seems to satisfy both conditions.\n\nBut let me check again:\n\n1. R (dictionary) - reference\n2. G (cookbook) - not reference\n3. B (novel) - not reference\n4. Y (atlas) - reference\n5. P (poetry) - not reference\n\nSo, R and Y are separated by G, B, and Y, so they are not adjacent. Good.\n\nAnd the complementary pairs are R-G, B-Y, and P-Y, all next to each other. So, this seems to work.\n\nBut let me see if there's another arrangement.\n\nOption 4:\n\nWhat if I place R and G together on the other end?\n\nG-R-B-Y-P\n\nBut then, G is next to R, which is good.\n\nY is next to B and P, which is good.\n\nReference books: R at 2, Y at 4. They are separated by B, so not adjacent. Good.\n\nComplementary pairs: G-R, B-Y, Y-P. All good.\n\nSo, this is another possible arrangement.\n\nWait, but the problem doesn't specify any particular order beyond the rules, so both could be solutions.\n\nBut let me check if there's a way to have R and G not at the ends.\n\nSuppose I place Y in the middle with B and P.\n\nSo, B-Y-P in positions 2-3-4.\n\nThen, R and G need to be together. So, maybe at the ends.\n\nSo, R-G-B-Y-P\n\nBut as before, R is at 1, G at 2, which is okay, but then G is next to B, which is a non-complementary color. Wait, G is green, B is blue. They are not complementary, so that's bad because the only complementary pairs are R-G, B-Y, and P-Y. So, G next to B is not allowed.\n\nTherefore, that arrangement doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe R and G in positions 4-5.\n\nSo, B-Y-P in 2-3-4, and R-G in 5? No, because position 4 is Y, and 5 is P, which is a reference book. Wait, P is not a reference book. Wait, reference books are R and Y. So, P is not a reference book, so P can be next to Y.\n\nSo, if I have Y at 4, P at 5, that's fine.\n\nBut then, R and G need to be together. So, maybe R at 1 and G at 2.\n\nSo, R-G-B-Y-P\n\nBut as before, G is next to B, which is not a complementary pair. So, that's not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, G at 5, but G is not a reference book, so it's okay. But R and G need to be together, so they can't be separated.\n\nWait, if I have R at 1 and G at 2, then G is next to B, which is not allowed. So, that doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, R at 5 and G at 4, but Y is at 4, so that's not possible.\n\nHmm, so maybe the only valid arrangements are the two I found earlier:\n\n1. R-G-B-Y-P\n\n2. G-R-B-Y-P\n\nWait, but in the second one, G is next to R, which is good, but then G is also next to B, which is not a complementary pair, but the rule is only about complementary pairs needing to be next to each other, not about non-complementary pairs. So, G can be next to B, as long as B is not next to a non-complementary.\n\nWait, no, the rule is that complementary colors should be next to each other, but it doesn't say anything about non-complementary colors. So, it's okay if G is next to B; the only requirement is that R-G, B-Y, and P-Y are next to each other.\n\nSo, both arrangements are valid.\n\nBut let me check again:\n\nIn R-G-B-Y-P:\n\n- R-G: complementary, good.\n\n- G-B: not complementary, but allowed.\n\n- B-Y: complementary, good.\n\n- Y-P: complementary, good.\n\n- P at the end, no issues.\n\nReference books: R at 1 and Y at 4, not adjacent, good.\n\nIn G-R-B-Y-P:\n\n- G-R: complementary, good.\n\n- R-B: not complementary, allowed.\n\n- B-Y: complementary, good.\n\n- Y-P: complementary, good.\n\n- P at the end, good.\n\nReference books: R at 2 and Y at 4, not adjacent, good.\n\nWait, but in this arrangement, R is at 2, which is next to G at 1 and B at 3. Since R is a reference book, it can't be next to another reference book. But B is not a reference book, so that's okay.\n\nYes, that works.\n\nAlternatively, could we have another arrangement where R and G are not at the ends?\n\nLet me try:\n\nB-Y-P in positions 2-3-4.\n\nThen, R and G need to be together, so maybe R-G at the beginning.\n\nSo, R-G-B-Y-P\n\nBut as before, G is next to B, which is not allowed because G is green and B is blue, which are not complementary. Wait, but the rule is only about complementary pairs needing to be next to each other, not about non-complementary pairs. So, G can be next to B.\n\nWait, but in the first arrangement, R-G-B-Y-P, G is next to B, which is allowed because the rule doesn't prohibit non-complementary pairs from being next to each other. It only requires that complementary pairs are next to each other.\n\nSo, that arrangement is okay.\n\nSimilarly, G-R-B-Y-P is also okay.\n\nBut let me see if there's another way.\n\nSuppose I place Y between B and P in the middle, and R and G on either end.\n\nSo, R-G-B-Y-P\n\nBut as before, G is next to B, which is okay.\n\nAlternatively, R-G-Y-P-B\n\nBut then Y is next to G and P, which is good, but Y also needs to be next to B, which is not adjacent here. So, that doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, B-Y-P in positions 3-4-5.\n\nSo, position 1: R or G\n\nPosition 2: R or G\n\nThen, B-Y-P at 3-4-5.\n\nSo, let's try:\n\nR-G-B-Y-P\n\nBut again, G is next to B, which is okay.\n\nAlternatively, G-R-B-Y-P\n\nSame as before.\n\nAlternatively, G-B-Y-P, but G and B are not complementary, so that's not allowed.\n\nWait, no, the rule is that complementary pairs must be next to each other. So, if G is next to B, that's not a complementary pair, but it's allowed because the rule doesn't prohibit it.\n\nSo, the two valid arrangements are R-G-B-Y-P and G-R-B-Y-P.\n\nBut wait, let me check the reference books again.\n\nIn R-G-B-Y-P:\n\n- R at 1, G at 2, B at 3, Y at 4, P at 5.\n\nReference books: R and Y. They are separated by G, B, and Y, so not adjacent. Good.\n\nIn G-R-B-Y-P:\n\n- G at 1, R at 2, B at 3, Y at 4, P at 5.\n\nReference books: R at 2 and Y at 4. They are separated by B, so not adjacent. Good.\n\nSo, both are valid.\n\nAlternatively, could we have Y in the middle with B and P, and R and G at the ends in a different way?\n\nSuppose:\n\nB-Y-P in positions 2-3-4.\n\nThen, R and G need to be at the ends.\n\nSo, R-G-B-Y-P\n\nBut as before, G is next to B, which is okay.\n\nAlternatively, G-R-B-Y-P\n\nSame.\n\nAlternatively, could we have R and G in positions 3-4?\n\nSo, position 3: G, position 4: R\n\nBut then, Y needs to be next to B and P.\n\nWait, let's try:\n\nPosition 1: B\n\nPosition 2: Y\n\nPosition 3: G\n\nPosition 4: R\n\nPosition 5: P\n\nBut then Y is next to B and G. Y needs to be next to B and P, but here Y is next to B and G. So, that's not good because G is not a complementary color to Y.\n\nSo, that doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively:\n\nPosition 1: B\n\nPosition 2: Y\n\nPosition 3: P\n\nPosition 4: G\n\nPosition 5: R\n\nBut then Y is next to B and P, which is good.\n\nG is next to P and R. G and P are not complementary, but that's allowed.\n\nR is next to G and nothing else. R is a reference book, and G is not, so that's okay.\n\nBut wait, R is at 5, next to G at 4. Since R is a reference book and G is not, that's allowed.\n\nBut the complementary pairs:\n\nB-Y: yes.\n\nY-P: yes.\n\nG-R: yes.\n\nSo, that works too.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\n1. B (blue novel)\n\n2. Y (yellow atlas)\n\n3. P (purple poetry)\n\n4. G (green cookbook)\n\n5. R (red dictionary)\n\nReference books: Y (atlas) and R (dictionary). They are at positions 2 and 5, separated by P, G, and R (but R is at 5). Wait, position 5 is R, which is a reference book, but position 4 is G, which is not. So, Y at 2 and R at 5 are not adjacent. Good.\n\nComplementary pairs:\n\nB-Y: yes.\n\nY-P: yes.\n\nG-R: yes.\n\nSo, this seems to work as well.\n\nWait, but in this arrangement, G is next to P and R. G and P are not complementary, but that's allowed. The only requirement is that complementary pairs are next to each other.\n\nSo, this is another valid arrangement.\n\nBut let me check if all reference books are not adjacent.\n\nY at 2 and R at 5: not adjacent. Good.\n\nSo, this works.\n\nSo, another possible arrangement is B-Y-P-G-R.\n\nWait, but in this case, Y is next to B and P, which is good.\n\nP is next to Y and G. P and G are not complementary, but allowed.\n\nG is next to P and R. G and R are complementary, good.\n\nR is at the end, next to G, which is a non-reference book, so that's okay.\n\nSo, this arrangement also works.\n\nBut wait, in this arrangement, the reference books are Y and R, not adjacent.\n\nSo, that's valid.\n\nBut let me see if there's a way to have Y in the middle with B and P, and R and G on either side.\n\nSo, perhaps:\n\nG-B-Y-P-R\n\nBut then Y is next to B and P, good.\n\nG is next to B, which is okay.\n\nP is next to Y and R. P and Y are complementary, good.\n\nR is next to P, which is a non-reference book, so okay.\n\nReference books: Y and R. They are at positions 3 and 5, not adjacent. Good.\n\nComplementary pairs:\n\nG-B: not complementary, but allowed.\n\nB-Y: yes.\n\nY-P: yes.\n\nP-R: not complementary, but allowed.\n\nWait, but the rule is that complementary pairs must be next to each other. So, P-R are not complementary, but it's allowed.\n\nSo, this arrangement works as well.\n\nBut wait, in this case, G is next to B, which is not a complementary pair, but that's allowed.\n\nSo, another valid arrangement is G-B-Y-P-R.\n\nSimilarly, could we have R-G-B-Y-P, which we considered earlier.\n\nAlternatively, G-R-B-Y-P.\n\nSo, multiple solutions exist.\n\nBut the problem is to provide one possible solution, I think.\n\nSo, perhaps the simplest"

The library has a rule that reference books (like dictionaries and atlases) cannot be placed next to each other. Additionally, the librarian wants books of complementary colors to be placed next to each other (red-green, blue-yellow, and purple-yellow are complementary color pairs). How can the librarian arrange the books to satisfy both conditions? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I need to help the librarian arrange these five books on a shelf. Let me start by understanding the problem properly.\n\nFirst, let's list out the books with their colors:\n\n1. Red Dictionary (R)\n2. Blue Novel (B)\n3. Green Cookbook (G)\n4. Yellow Atlas (Y)\n5. Purple Poetry Collection (P)\n\nThe rules are:\n\n1. **Reference books can't be placed next to each other.** From the list, the reference books are the Dictionary (R) and the Atlas (Y). So, R and Y can't be adjacent.\n\n2. **Complementary colors must be placed next to each other.** The complementary pairs given are:\n   - Red-Green (R-G)\n   - Blue-Yellow (B-Y)\n   - Purple-Yellow (P-Y)\n\nWait, hold on. Purple-Yellow is also a complementary pair? I thought purple and yellow are complementary, but I'm a bit unsure. Let me double-check. Yes, purple and yellow are considered complementary colors because they are positioned opposite each other on the color wheel. So, that makes sense.\n\nNow, I need to arrange these books so that each complementary pair is next to each other, and also ensure that R and Y aren't next to each other.\n\nLet me try to visualize this. Maybe I can start by pairing the complementary colors.\n\n- R needs to be next to G.\n- B needs to be next to Y.\n- P needs to be next to Y.\n\nWait a minute, that's a problem because both B and P want to be next to Y. So Y is paired with both B and P. But since Y can't be paired with both at the same time, I need to find a way to place them such that they are each adjacent to their respective partners without conflicting.\n\nPerhaps I can arrange them in a way that Y is in the middle, with B on one side and P on the other. That way, both B and P are adjacent to Y, satisfying their complementary pairs.\n\nSo, let's try this:\n\nStart with Y in the middle.\n\n- Y is between B and P.\n\nSo, B-Y-P.\n\nNow, R needs to be next to G. So, R-G.\n\nBut R and Y can't be next to each other. So, we need to place R and G somewhere else.\n\nLet me try to sketch this out.\n\nPossible arrangement so far:\n\nB - Y - P\n\nNow, we need to place R and G. Since R can't be next to Y, and G can be next to R, let's see where to place them.\n\nOne option is to place R and G at one end, ensuring they aren't adjacent to Y.\n\nLet's try:\n\nB - Y - P\n\nNow, we have two spots left: one on the left of B and one on the right of P.\n\nLet's place R and G on either end.\n\nWait, but if we place R next to B, then R is next to B, which is okay because R is a reference book and B is a novel, which is not a reference. So that's allowed.\n\nBut then G would be next to P. Is that okay? Let's see.\n\nWait, G is a cookbook and P is a poetry collection. They are different, but G is green and P is purple. Are they complementary? No, the pairs are R-G, B-Y, and P-Y. So G doesn't need to be next to P.\n\nSo, perhaps placing R next to B and G next to P.\n\nWait, but if we do that, the arrangement would be:\n\nG - R - B - Y - P\n\nBut let's check:\n\n- R is next to B: R is a reference, B is not, so that's okay.\n- B is next to Y: they are a complementary pair, good.\n- Y is next to P: they are a complementary pair, good.\n- R is next to B and G. Wait, no, in this arrangement, R is between B and G? No, if we have G - R - B - Y - P, then R is between G and B. But R can't be next to Y, but here R is next to B, which is fine. However, G is next to R, which is correct because G is complementary to R.\n\nWait, but in this arrangement, G is next to R and B. G only needs to be next to R; it doesn't matter about B.\n\nBut let's check if all the rules are satisfied.\n\n- Reference books: R and Y. Are they next to each other? In this arrangement, R is at position 2, Y is at position 4. They are not adjacent, so that's good.\n\n- Complementary pairs:\n  - R-G: Yes, positions 1-2.\n  - B-Y: Yes, positions 3-4.\n  - P-Y: Yes, positions 4-5.\n\nWait, but P is at position 5, and Y is at 4. So P-Y is a pair, good.\n\nBut wait, in the initial arrangement, I had B-Y-P, and then added G and R on either side. So the full arrangement would be G-R-B-Y-P.\n\nLet me write that out:\n\nG - R - B - Y - P\n\nNow, let's check adjacency:\n\n- G is next to R: good.\n- R is next to B: R is a reference, B is not, so that's okay.\n- B is next to Y: good.\n- Y is next to P: good.\n\nAlso, reference books R and Y are not adjacent, so that's okay.\n\nIs there a better arrangement? Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe placing Y in the middle with P and B on either side, and then R and G at the ends.\n\nBut in this case, we have R next to G, which is good, and Y next to B and P, which is also good.\n\nAlternatively, could we have R and G at the other end? Let's try.\n\nStart with Y in the middle.\n\nB - Y - P\n\nThen, place R and G on the right end.\n\nBut then R would be next to P, which is okay because R is a reference and P is not. So:\n\nB - Y - P - G - R\n\nBut then R is next to G, which is good. Let's check:\n\n- R is next to G: good.\n- P is next to Y: good.\n- B is next to Y: good.\n- Y is next to P and B: but Y is only supposed to be next to B and P. So that's okay.\n\nBut in this arrangement, R is at the end, next to G, which is fine.\n\nWait, but in this case, the arrangement is B - Y - P - G - R.\n\nBut then R is next to G, which is correct, and all the complementary pairs are together.\n\nAlso, R and Y are not adjacent, so that's okay.\n\nAlternatively, could we have a different arrangement?\n\nAnother approach: Since R and Y can't be adjacent, and both need to be placed with their complements, let's try to place R and G together, and B and Y together, and P and Y together.\n\nBut since P and Y are both needing to be next to Y, perhaps Y is in the middle with B and P on either side, and R and G on the ends.\n\nSo:\n\nR - G - B - Y - P\n\nWait, but in this case, G is next to B, which is okay because G only needs to be next to R. Similarly, R is next to G, which is good.\n\nBut let's check:\n\n- R is next to G: good.\n- G is next to B: okay, since G only needs to be next to R.\n- B is next to Y: good.\n- Y is next to P: good.\n- P is next to nothing else, but that's okay.\n\nWait, but in this arrangement, R is at position 1, G at 2, B at 3, Y at 4, P at 5.\n\nSo the sequence is R-G-B-Y-P.\n\nIs this acceptable?\n\n- R and Y are not adjacent: R is at 1, Y at 4: not adjacent, good.\n- Complementary pairs:\n  - R-G: yes.\n  - B-Y: yes.\n  - P-Y: yes.\n\nSo this seems to work.\n\nAlternatively, could we have Y in the middle with B and P on either side, and R and G on the ends?\n\nYes, as in the earlier arrangement.\n\nBut let's think if there's a way to make it more optimal.\n\nWait, another idea: Since P and Y are both needing to be next to Y, perhaps Y is in the middle, with P on one side and B on the other. Then, R and G can be placed at the ends.\n\nSo:\n\nP - Y - B\n\nThen, R and G on either end.\n\nSo:\n\nR - P - Y - B - G\n\nBut wait, R is next to P, which is okay because R is a reference and P is not. But G is next to B, which is okay because G only needs to be next to R.\n\nBut in this arrangement:\n\n- R is next to P: okay.\n- P is next to Y: good.\n- Y is next to B: good.\n- B is next to G: okay.\n- G is next to R: good.\n\nBut wait, R is at position 1, next to P at 2, which is okay. G is at position 5, next to B at 4.\n\nBut let's check the complementary pairs:\n\n- R-G: yes, positions 1-5? No, they are not adjacent. So that's a problem.\n\nAh, right, in this arrangement, R and G are at the ends, not adjacent. So R and G are not next to each other, which violates the complementary pair rule.\n\nSo that doesn't work.\n\nTherefore, R and G need to be adjacent, so they can't be at the ends unless they are next to each other.\n\nTherefore, the previous arrangement where R and G are at the ends but adjacent is better.\n\nSo, back to the earlier arrangement:\n\nR - G - B - Y - P\n\nOr\n\nG - R - B - Y - P\n\nBoth seem to work.\n\nWait, let me check again.\n\nIn R-G-B-Y-P:\n\n- R and G are together: good.\n- B and Y are together: good.\n- Y and P are together: good.\n- R and Y are not adjacent: good.\n\nSimilarly, in G-R-B-Y-P, it's the same.\n\nAlternatively, could we have a different order where Y is not in the middle?\n\nLet me think. Suppose we start with R and G together, then place B and Y together, and then P next to Y.\n\nWait, but then P would be next to Y, which is good, but where does P go?\n\nLet me try:\n\nR - G - B - Y - P\n\nThis is the same as before.\n\nAlternatively:\n\nR - G - P - Y - B\n\nBut then Y is next to P and B, which is good. But R and G are together, and G is next to P, which is okay because G only needs to be next to R.\n\nBut in this arrangement:\n\n- R is next to G: good.\n- G is next to P: okay.\n- P is next to Y: good.\n- Y is next to B: good.\n- B is next to nothing else, which is fine.\n\nBut let's check the complementary pairs:\n\n- R-G: yes.\n- B-Y: yes.\n- P-Y: yes.\n\nSo this also works.\n\nWait, so this is another possible arrangement: R-G-P-Y-B.\n\nLet me check adjacency:\n\n- R next to G: good.\n- G next to P: okay.\n- P next to Y: good.\n- Y next to B: good.\n- R and Y are not adjacent: good.\n\nYes, that works.\n\nSo now I have two possible arrangements:\n\n1. R-G-B-Y-P\n2. R-G-P-Y-B\n\nWait, but in the second one, G is next to P, which is okay, but in the first one, G is next to B, which is also okay because G only needs to be next to R.\n\nSo both are valid.\n\nAre there more arrangements?\n\nLet me think.\n\nAnother approach: Since Y needs to be next to both B and P, and B and P can't be next to each other (since they are both non-reference books, but the rule only prohibits reference books from being adjacent). Wait, no, the rule only says reference books can't be next to each other. So B and P can be next to each other.\n\nWait, but in the initial problem, the complementary pairs are R-G, B-Y, and P-Y. So B and Y must be together, P and Y must be together, but B and P don't necessarily need to be together unless they are placed next to each other.\n\nSo, in the arrangement where Y is in the middle, with B and P on either side, that's acceptable.\n\nSo, let's try:\n\nB - Y - P\n\nThen, place R and G on either end.\n\nSo:\n\nR - B - Y - P - G\n\nBut in this case, R is next to B, which is okay because R is a reference and B is not. G is next to P, which is okay because G only needs to be next to R.\n\nBut let's check:\n\n- R next to B: okay.\n- B next to Y: good.\n- Y next to P: good.\n- P next to G: okay.\n- R and Y are not adjacent: good.\n\nAlso, complementary pairs:\n\n- R-G: yes, but in this arrangement, R is at 1 and G at 5, so they are not adjacent. So that's a problem.\n\nAh, right, so R and G need to be next to each other. So this arrangement doesn't work because R and G are not adjacent.\n\nTherefore, R and G must be placed next to each other, either at one end or somewhere in the middle.\n\nSo, perhaps placing R and G together at one end, and Y in the middle with B and P on either side.\n\nSo:\n\nR - G - B - Y - P\n\nThis way, R and G are together, B and Y are together, Y and P are together, and R and Y are not adjacent.\n\nAlternatively, G - R - B - Y - P.\n\nEither way, it's the same.\n\nAnother idea: Could Y be at the end, with B and P on either side, and R and G somewhere else?\n\nLet's try:\n\nB - Y - P\n\nThen, place R and G on the ends.\n\nSo:\n\nR - B - Y - P - G\n\nBut again, R and G are not adjacent, so that's bad.\n\nAlternatively, place R and G in the middle.\n\nWait, but that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, place Y at the end.\n\nWait, perhaps:\n\nG - R - B - Y - P\n\nWhich is the same as before.\n\nAlternatively, could we have Y in the middle, with P and B on either side, and R and G on the ends, but R and G adjacent.\n\nWait, that's what we did earlier.\n\nI think the two possible arrangements are:\n\n1. R-G-B-Y-P\n2. R-G-P-Y-B\n\nWait, but in the second one, G is next to P, which is okay, but in the first one, G is next to B, which is also okay.\n\nSo both are valid.\n\nWait, but let me check another possibility.\n\nSuppose we place Y in the middle, with B on one side and P on the other.\n\nThen, place R and G on the ends.\n\nSo:\n\nR - B - Y - P - G\n\nBut as before, R and G are not adjacent, so that's bad.\n\nAlternatively, place R next to G on one side, and B and Y on the other.\n\nWait, maybe:\n\nR - G - Y - B - P\n\nBut let's check:\n\n- R next to G: good.\n- G next to Y: okay, since G only needs to be next to R.\n- Y next to B: good.\n- B next to P: okay, since B is a novel and P is a poetry collection, but they don't need to be complementary.\n- P next to nothing else: okay.\n\nBut wait, in this arrangement, R is at 1, G at 2, Y at 3, B at 4, P at 5.\n\nSo R-G-Y-B-P.\n\nCheck complementary pairs:\n\n- R-G: yes.\n- B-Y: yes, positions 4-3? No, they are not adjacent. Wait, Y is at 3, B at 4: yes, they are adjacent.\n\nWait, in this arrangement, Y is at 3, B at 4: so B-Y is together.\n\nSimilarly, Y is at 3, G at 2: G-Y is together, but G only needs to be next to R, so that's okay.\n\nBut wait, in this arrangement, G is next to Y and R.\n\nYes, G is next to R and Y, which is fine because G only needs to be next to R.\n\nBut the problem is that B-Y is together, Y-P is not, because P is at 5.\n\nWait, no, in this arrangement, Y is at 3, and P is at 5, so they are not adjacent.\n\nSo, in this arrangement, Y is only next to G and B.\n\nBut Y needs to be next to both B and P, so this doesn't work.\n\nTherefore, Y needs to be next to both B and P, so they must be on either side of Y.\n\nTherefore, the earlier arrangements where Y is in the middle with B and P on either side are the correct ones.\n\nSo, the valid arrangements are:\n\n1. R-G-B-Y-P\n2. R-G-P-Y-B\n\nWait, but in the second one, G is next to P, which is okay, but in the first one, G is next to B, which is also okay.\n\nSo both are acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, could we have Y in the middle with P and B on either side, and R and G on the ends but adjacent?\n\nYes, as in:\n\nR - G - B - Y - P\n\nWhich is the same as R-G-B-Y-P.\n\nAlternatively, G - R - B - Y - P.\n\nEither way, it's the same.\n\nSo, I think these are the two possible valid arrangements.\n\nBut wait, let me think again.\n\nIs there a way to have Y in the middle with B and P on either side, and R and G on the ends, but R and G not adjacent.\n\nWait, but R and G need to be adjacent, so they can't be on the ends unless they are next to each other.\n\nTherefore, the only way is to have R and G together, either at the start or somewhere in the middle.\n\nWait, another idea: Maybe place R and G together in the middle, with Y, B, and P arranged around them.\n\nBut that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, let's try:\n\nB - Y - P\n\nThen, place R and G on either side, but together.\n\nSo:\n\nR - G - B - Y - P\n\nWhich is the same as before.\n\nAlternatively, place"

    "solution": "Solve this problem step by step. End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: A librarian needs to arrange five books on a shelf: a red dictionary, a blue novel, a green cookbook, a yellow atlas, and a purple poetry collection. The library has a rule that reference books (like dictionaries and atlases) cannot be placed next to each other. Additionally, the librarian wants books of complementary colors to be placed next to each other (red-green, blue-yellow, and purple-yellow are complementary color pairs). How can the librarian arrange the books to satisfy both conditions? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I've got this problem about arranging five books on a shelf. The books are a red dictionary, a blue novel, a green cookbook, a yellow atlas, and a purple poetry collection. There are two main rules to follow: first, reference books (which are dictionaries and atlases) can't be placed next to each other. Second, books of complementary colors should be placed next to each other. The complementary pairs given are red-green, blue-yellow, and purple-yellow.\n\nOkay, let me break this down. I need to figure out a way to arrange these five books on a shelf without violating either rule. Let's list out the books with their colors and types:\n\n1. Red Dictionary (Reference)\n2. Blue Novel (Fiction)\n3. Green Cookbook (Cookbook)\n4. Yellow Atlas (Reference)\n5. Purple Poetry Collection (Literary)\n\nFirst, I should identify which books are reference books. The red dictionary and the yellow atlas are both references. The blue novel, green cookbook, and purple poetry collection are not reference books.\n\nRule 1: Reference books cannot be placed next to each other. So, red and yellow cannot be adjacent.\n\nRule 2: Complementary colors should be next to each other. The pairs are:\n\n- Red and Green\n- Blue and Yellow\n- Purple and Yellow\n\nWait, purple and yellow are complementary? Hmm, I thought purple and yellow might not be a standard complementary pair, but according to the problem, they are. So, purple and yellow should be next to each other.\n\nSo, the complementary pairs are red-green, blue-yellow, and purple-yellow.\n\nNow, I need to arrange these five books so that:\n\n1. Red and Yellow (atlas) are not next to each other.\n2. Red is next to Green.\n3. Blue is next to Yellow.\n4. Purple is next to Yellow.\n\nBut wait, that might not be possible because Blue is also supposed to be next to Yellow, but Purple is also next to Yellow. So, Yellow would have to be between both Blue and Purple. But since Yellow is only one book, it can only be adjacent to two books. So, Yellow would have to be in the middle, with one book on its left and one on its right. But Blue and Purple can't both be adjacent to Yellow unless they are on either side. However, that would require Yellow to be in the middle, with Blue on one side and Purple on the other.\n\nBut then, where would Red and Green go? They need to be next to each other too.\n\nLet me try to visualize this.\n\nLet me think of the shelf as positions 1 to 5.\n\nI need to place Yellow in such a way that it's next to both Blue and Purple, but not next to Red or Green. Wait, no, Yellow can be next to Blue and Purple, but not next to Red or Green? Or can it be next to them as long as it's not adjacent to another reference book?\n\nWait, no, the only restriction is that reference books can't be next to each other. So, Yellow (a reference book) can be next to non-reference books, but not next to another reference book, which is Red.\n\nSo, Yellow can be next to Blue, Purple, or Green, but not next to Red.\n\nSimilarly, Red can be next to Blue, Purple, or Green, but not next to Yellow.\n\nSo, perhaps Yellow is between Blue and Purple.\n\nLet me try to sketch this out.\n\nLet's try to place Yellow in the middle, position 3.\n\nSo, position 3 is Yellow.\n\nThen, position 2 could be Blue, and position 4 could be Purple. That way, Blue is next to Yellow, and Purple is next to Yellow.\n\nSo, the arrangement so far is: [Blue], Yellow, [Purple].\n\nNow, where to place Red and Green. They need to be next to each other, so they should form a pair. Let's see where they can go.\n\nIf Blue is in position 2, then position 1 could be someone. Position 5 is after Purple, so maybe position 1 could be Red, and position 5 could be Green.\n\nBut wait, Red and Green need to be next to each other. If I put Red in position 1 and Green in position 2, but position 2 is Blue, which is not Green. So that doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, if I put Green in position 5 and someone else in position 4, but position 4 is Purple.\n\nHmm. Maybe I need to adjust.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Yellow is not in the middle but at one end.\n\nLet me try placing Yellow at position 1.\n\nThen, position 2 can be Blue or Purple, but Blue and Purple need to be next to Yellow.\n\nBut Blue and Purple can't both be next to Yellow unless they are on either side.\n\nWait, if Yellow is at position 1, position 2 can be Blue or Purple.\n\nSuppose position 2 is Blue. Then, Blue is next to Yellow.\n\nBut Purple also needs to be next to Yellow, so Purple would have to be in position 3.\n\nSo, Yellow, Blue, Purple.\n\nThen, positions 4 and 5 are left for Red and Green, who need to be next to each other.\n\nIf I put Red in position 4 and Green in position 5, that would work because they are next to each other.\n\nBut let's check the adjacency.\n\n- Yellow (1) next to Blue (2) \u2013 good.\n- Blue (2) next to Yellow (1) and Purple (3) \u2013 but Blue is only supposed to be next to Yellow, but it's also next to Purple. Is that a problem? No, because the rule is about reference books not being next to each other. Blue is not a reference book, so it's fine to be next to Purple.\n\nWait, no, the rule is about reference books not being next to each other. So, Blue is not a reference book, so it can be next to Purple, who is a literary book. So that's okay.\n\nThen, Purple (3) is next to Blue (2) and Yellow (1). But Purple is a literary book, so it's fine.\n\nThen, position 4 is Red (dictionary), and position 5 is Green (cookbook). So, Red is next to Purple and Green is next to Red. But Red is a reference book, and Purple is a literary book, so that's okay because only reference books can't be next to each other.\n\nWait, but Red is a reference book, and if it's next to Purple, which is not a reference book, that's allowed. Similarly, Green is next to Red, which is okay because Green is not a reference book.\n\nSo, in this arrangement, the only adjacency involving reference books is Red next to Yellow? Wait, no, Yellow is a reference book, and it's next to Blue and Purple, both non-reference books. So that's okay because the rule is that reference books can't be next to each other, not that they can't be next to non-reference books.\n\nWait, but Red is a reference book, and it's next to Purple and Green. That's allowed because the rule only prohibits reference books from being next to each other, not from being next to non-reference books.\n\nBut wait, the rule says reference books cannot be placed next to each other. It doesn't say anything about reference books and non-reference books. So, as long as Red isn't next to Yellow, it's okay.\n\nWait, no, Yellow is also a reference book. So, in this arrangement, Yellow is at position 1, next to Blue (position 2). Then, Red is at position 4, next to Purple (position 3). Wait, no, in this arrangement:\n\n1: Yellow\n\n2: Blue\n\n3: Purple\n\n4: Red\n\n5: Green\n\nSo, Yellow is next to Blue, which is okay because Blue is not a reference book. Red is next to Purple, which is okay because Purple is not a reference book. So, the only potential problem is whether Red is next to Yellow indirectly through Purple. But no, they are not adjacent.\n\nWait, but in this arrangement, Red is in position 4, next to Purple (position 3), and Green is next to Red (position 5). So, Red is not next to Yellow, which is position 1. So, that's okay.\n\nBut let me check the complementary pairs:\n\n- Red and Green are next to each other (positions 4 and 5). Good.\n\n- Blue and Yellow are next to each other (positions 1 and 2). Good.\n\n- Purple and Yellow are not next to each other in this arrangement because Purple is at position 3, next to Blue and Yellow is at position 1. So, Purple and Yellow are not adjacent.\n\nWait, that's a problem because the rule says Purple and Yellow should be next to each other.\n\nSo, in this arrangement, Purple is at position 3, and Yellow is at position 1. They are not adjacent, so that violates the complementary color rule.\n\nSo, this arrangement doesn't work because Purple and Yellow are not next to each other.\n\nLet me try another approach. Maybe place Yellow in the middle.\n\nLet me try:\n\nPosition 1: Blue\n\nPosition 2: ?\n\nPosition 3: Yellow\n\nPosition 4: Purple\n\nPosition 5: ?\n\nNow, Blue is at 1, Yellow at 3, Purple at 4.\n\nThen, positions 2 and 5 are Red and Green, who need to be next to each other.\n\nIf I put Red at position 2 and Green at position 3, but position 3 is Yellow, which is a reference book. So, Green cannot be next to Yellow because Green is not a reference book, but the problem doesn't say that non-reference books can't be next to reference books. Only reference books can't be next to each other.\n\nWait, no, the rule is that reference books can't be next to each other. So, non-reference books can be next to reference books.\n\nBut in this case, if I put Green next to Yellow, that's allowed because Yellow is a reference book, and Green is not. So, that's okay.\n\nBut wait, Green is a cookbook, which is not a reference book, so it's fine to be next to Yellow (atlas), which is a reference book.\n\nSo, let's try:\n\n1: Blue\n\n2: Green\n\n3: Yellow\n\n4: Purple\n\n5: Red\n\nNow, check the adjacency:\n\n- Blue (1) next to Green (2): Blue is not a reference book, Green is not, so that's okay.\n\n- Green (2) next to Yellow (3): Green is not a reference book, Yellow is, but that's allowed.\n\n- Yellow (3) next to Green (2) and Purple (4): Both are non-reference books, so that's okay.\n\n- Purple (4) next to Yellow (3) and Red (5): Purple is not a reference book, Red is, but that's allowed.\n\n- Red (5) next to Purple (4): Red is a reference book, Purple is not, so that's okay.\n\nNow, check the complementary pairs:\n\n- Red and Green: Red is at 5, Green is at 2. They are not adjacent. So, that's a problem because they need to be next to each other.\n\nAh, right, so that doesn't work.\n\nSo, Red and Green need to be next to each other.\n\nLet me adjust.\n\nIf I place Red at position 2 and Green at position 3.\n\nSo:\n\n1: Blue\n\n2: Red\n\n3: Green\n\n4: Yellow\n\n5: Purple\n\nNow, check adjacency:\n\n- Blue (1) next to Red (2): Blue is non-reference, Red is reference. That's okay.\n\n- Red (2) next to Blue (1) and Green (3): Red is reference, Green is non-reference. Okay.\n\n- Green (3) next to Red (2) and Yellow (4): Green is non-reference, Yellow is reference. Okay.\n\n- Yellow (4) next to Green (3) and Purple (5): Yellow is reference, Purple is non-reference. Okay.\n\n- Purple (5) next to Yellow (4): Purple is non-reference, Yellow is reference. Okay.\n\nNow, check complementary pairs:\n\n- Red and Green: They are next to each other (positions 2 and 3). Good.\n\n- Blue and Yellow: Blue is at 1, Yellow is at 4. Not adjacent. Problem.\n\n- Purple and Yellow: Purple is at 5, Yellow is at 4. They are adjacent. Good.\n\nSo, the problem is that Blue and Yellow are not adjacent. So, this arrangement fails the complementary pair rule for Blue and Yellow.\n\nSo, I need to adjust so that Blue and Yellow are next to each other.\n\nLet me try placing Yellow at position 2, next to Blue at position 1.\n\nSo:\n\n1: Blue\n\n2: Yellow\n\n3: ?\n\n4: ?\n\n5: ?\n\nNow, Blue and Yellow are next to each other. Good.\n\nNow, Purple needs to be next to Yellow, so Purple could be at position 3.\n\nSo:\n\n1: Blue\n\n2: Yellow\n\n3: Purple\n\n4: ?\n\n5: ?\n\nNow, Red and Green need to be next to each other. They can be placed in positions 4 and 5.\n\nSo:\n\n4: Red\n\n5: Green\n\nSo the arrangement is:\n\n1: Blue\n\n2: Yellow\n\n3: Purple\n\n4: Red\n\n5: Green\n\nNow, check adjacency:\n\n- Blue (1) next to Yellow (2): Good.\n\n- Yellow (2) next to Blue (1) and Purple (3): Good.\n\n- Purple (3) next to Yellow (2) and Red (4): Purple is non-reference, Red is reference. Okay.\n\n- Red (4) next to Purple (3) and Green (5): Red is reference, Green is non-reference. Okay.\n\n- Green (5) next to Red (4): Green is non-reference, Red is reference. Okay.\n\nNow, check complementary pairs:\n\n- Red and Green: They are next to each other (positions 4 and 5). Good.\n\n- Blue and Yellow: Next to each other (positions 1 and 2). Good.\n\n- Purple and Yellow: Next to each other (positions 2 and 3). Good.\n\nWait, but Purple and Yellow are next to each other in positions 2 and 3, and Yellow and Blue are next to each other in 1 and 2. So, Yellow is between Blue and Purple, which is allowed because Yellow is only one book.\n\nNow, let's check the reference books: Yellow (position 2) and Red (position 4). They are not adjacent, so that's okay.\n\nSo, this arrangement seems to satisfy both rules.\n\nBut let me write it out again:\n\n1: Blue\n\n2: Yellow\n\n3: Purple\n\n4: Red\n\n5: Green\n\nWait, but in this arrangement, Red is next to Purple (position 3) and Green (position 5). So, Red is next to Purple and Green. But the rule is that reference books can't be next to each other. Red is a reference book, but it's next to Purple and Green, which are non-reference books. That's allowed.\n\nSimilarly, Yellow is next to Blue and Purple, both non-reference books, which is allowed.\n\nSo, the only adjacency involving reference books is between Red and Yellow? No, Red is at position 4, and Yellow is at position 2. They are not adjacent. So, no reference books are adjacent. Good.\n\nWait, but in this arrangement, Red is next to Purple (position 3) and Green (position 5). So, Red is not next to any other reference books, which is okay.\n\nSo, this seems to work.\n\nBut let me check if there's another possible arrangement.\n\nAlternatively, could I place Purple and Yellow at the end?\n\nLet me try:\n\n1: Red\n\n2: Blue\n\n3: Green\n\n4: Yellow\n\n5: Purple\n\nNow, check adjacency:\n\n- Red (1) next to Blue (2): Red is reference, Blue is non-reference. Okay.\n\n- Blue (2) next to Red (1) and Green (3): Blue is non-reference, Green is non-reference. Okay.\n\n- Green (3) next to Blue (2) and Yellow (4): Green is non-reference, Yellow is reference. Okay.\n\n- Yellow (4) next to Green (3) and Purple (5): Yellow is reference, Purple is non-reference. Okay.\n\n- Purple (5) next to Yellow (4): Purple is non-reference, Yellow is reference. Okay.\n\nNow, check complementary pairs:\n\n- Red and Green: They are not next to each other. Red is at 1, Green at 3. So, problem.\n\n- Blue and Yellow: Blue is at 2, Yellow at 4. Not adjacent. Problem.\n\n- Purple and Yellow: They are next to each other (positions 4 and 5). Good.\n\nSo, this arrangement fails because Red and Green are not next to each other, and Blue and Yellow are not next to each other.\n\nAnother attempt: Place Yellow between Blue and Purple, and place Red and Green next to each other somewhere else.\n\nLet me try:\n\n1: Blue\n\n2: Yellow\n\n3: Purple\n\n4: Green\n\n5: Red\n\nNow, check adjacency:\n\n- Blue (1) next to Yellow (2): Good.\n\n- Yellow (2) next to Blue (1) and Purple (3): Good.\n\n- Purple (3) next to Yellow (2) and Green (4): Purple is non-reference, Green is non-reference. Okay.\n\n- Green (4) next to Purple (3) and Red (5): Green is non-reference, Red is reference. Okay.\n\n- Red (5) next to Green (4): Red is reference, Green is non-reference. Okay.\n\nNow, complementary pairs:\n\n- Red and Green: Next to each other (positions 4 and 5). Good.\n\n- Blue and Yellow: Next to each other (positions 1 and 2). Good.\n\n- Purple and Yellow: Next to each other (positions 2 and 3). Good.\n\nSo, this seems to work as well.\n\nSo, two possible arrangements:\n\n1. Blue, Yellow, Purple, Green, Red.\n\n2. Blue, Yellow, Purple, Red, Green.\n\nWait, no, in the second case, Red is at position 5, next to Green at 4. So, the second arrangement is:\n\n1: Blue\n\n2: Yellow\n\n3: Purple\n\n4: Red\n\n5: Green\n\nBut wait, in that case, Red is at 4, next to Purple (3) and Green (5). So, Red is next to Purple, which is okay, and next to Green, which is okay because Green is non-reference.\n\nBut let me check if that's correct.\n\nYes, because the only rule is that reference books can't be next to each other. So, as long as Red isn't next to Yellow, it's okay. In this arrangement, Red is at 4, next to Purple at 3 and Green at 5. So, that's allowed.\n\nSo, both arrangements work.\n\nAlternatively, could I place Red and Green somewhere else?\n\nLet me try placing Red at position 5 and Green at position 4.\n\nSo:\n\n1: Blue\n\n2: Yellow\n\n3: Purple\n\n4: Green\n\n5"

    "solution": "Solve this problem step by step. End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: A librarian needs to arrange five books on a shelf: a red dictionary, a blue novel, a green cookbook, a yellow atlas, and a purple poetry collection. The library has a rule that reference books (like dictionaries and atlases) cannot be placed next to each other. Additionally, the librarian wants books of complementary colors to be placed next to each other (red-green, blue-yellow, and purple-yellow are complementary color pairs). How can the librarian arrange the books to satisfy both conditions? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem where a librarian needs to arrange five books on a shelf. The books are of different colors: red dictionary, blue novel, green cookbook, yellow atlas, and purple poetry collection. There are two main rules here that I need to follow.\n\nFirst, reference books, which are the dictionary and the atlas, cannot be placed next to each other. So, the red dictionary and the yellow atlas are both reference books, and they can't be adjacent. The blue novel and the purple poetry collection are not reference books, so they don't have this restriction.\n\nThe second rule is about complementary colors. The librarian wants books of complementary colors to be placed next to each other. The given complementary pairs are red-green, blue-yellow, and purple-yellow. So, red should be next to green, blue should be next to yellow, and purple should be next to yellow.\n\nWait, let me make sure I understand the complementary pairs correctly. The problem says red-green, blue-yellow, and purple-yellow are complementary. So, red complements green, blue complements yellow, and purple complements yellow. That means each of these pairs should be next to each other.\n\nNow, I need to arrange these five books on a shelf following both rules. Let me list out the books with their colors:\n\n1. Red dictionary (reference)\n2. Blue novel\n3. Green cookbook\n4. Yellow atlas (reference)\n5. Purple poetry collection\n\nFirst, I'll note which books are reference and which are not. The red dictionary and yellow atlas are references, so they can't be next to each other. The other three books are not references, so they don't have that restriction.\n\nNext, the complementary pairs:\n\n- Red (dictionary) must be next to green (cookbook)\n- Blue (novel) must be next to yellow (atlas)\n- Purple (poetry) must be next to yellow (atlas)\n\nWait, but purple also needs to be next to yellow. So, purple needs to be adjacent to yellow, but yellow is a reference book. So, purple can be next to yellow, but yellow can't be next to another reference book, which is red. So, the purple poetry collection can be next to yellow, but the red dictionary can't be next to yellow because it's also a reference.\n\nHmm, this might be a bit tricky because both red and yellow are references and can't be next to each other, but both also need to be next to green and blue/yellow, respectively.\n\nLet me try to map this out.\n\nFirst, I need to place red next to green. So, red and green must be adjacent. Similarly, blue must be next to yellow, and purple must be next to yellow.\n\nSo, let's consider the possible pairs:\n\n- Red-Green\n- Blue-Yellow\n- Purple-Yellow\n\nNow, since red and yellow are both references and can't be next to each other, I need to ensure that red is only next to green, and yellow is only next to blue and purple.\n\nLet me try to visualize the shelf as positions 1 to 5.\n\nI need to place the books in such a way that:\n\n- Red is next to Green\n- Blue is next to Yellow\n- Purple is next to Yellow\n- Red and Yellow are not next to each other\n\nSo, perhaps I can start by placing the red and green together. Let's say positions 1 and 2 are red and green. But then, green is next to red, which is good, but green is a non-reference, so it can be next to red. Now, red is at 1, so position 2 is green. Then, green needs to be next to red, which it is, but green can also be next to another non-reference or maybe a reference, but references can't be next to each other.\n\nWait, the problem only says references can't be next to each other, so non-references can be next to references. So, green being next to red is okay because green is a non-reference.\n\nNow, after red and green, let's look at the other pairs. Blue needs to be next to yellow, and purple needs to be next to yellow. So, yellow needs to be between blue and purple. So, perhaps blue is at position 3, yellow at 4, and purple at 5. But then, yellow is next to blue and purple, which satisfies both their needs. But let's check if this works with the other constraints.\n\nSo, let's try:\n\n1. Red\n2. Green\n3. Blue\n4. Yellow\n5. Purple\n\nNow, let's check the adjacency:\n\n- Red (1) next to Green (2): Good, they are complementary.\n- Green (2) next to Blue (3): Hmm, green and blue are not complementary. Green is red's pair, blue is yellow's pair, and purple is yellow's pair. So, this might be a problem because green and blue are not supposed to be next to each other. The only required adjacents are the complementary pairs. So, green should only be next to red, and blue should only be next to yellow, and purple next to yellow.\n\nSo, in this arrangement, green is next to blue, which is not allowed because they are not complementary. So, this doesn't work.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Maybe place the complementary pairs first and then fill in the gaps.\n\nLet's start by placing red and green together. Let's say positions 1 and 2 are red and green.\n\n1. Red\n2. Green\n\nNow, from position 2, green can only go to red, so the next position after green should be non-reference or another non-complementary. Wait, no, the only requirement is that green must be next to red. So, after green, we can place any book that is not a reference or violates the rules.\n\nWait, no, the only rule is that references can't be next to each other, and complementary pairs must be adjacent. So, after green, we can place any book as long as it's not a reference next to another reference and doesn't break the complementary rule.\n\nBut green is a non-reference, so placing a reference next to it is allowed. However, the next book should not be a reference unless it's complementary to green. But green's complement is red, which is already placed. So, after green, the next book can be any non-reference or a reference that is not conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of the complementary pairs as fixed and then see how to place them without violating the reference adjacency.\n\nLet me try another way. Let's list the complementary pairs:\n\n- Red-Green\n- Blue-Yellow\n- Purple-Yellow\n\nSo, Red-Green must be adjacent, Blue-Yellow must be adjacent, and Purple-Yellow must be adjacent.\n\nNow, since Blue-Yellow and Purple-Yellow are both involving Yellow, Yellow must be between Blue and Purple. So, Yellow is in the middle of Blue and Purple.\n\nSo, perhaps the sequence is Blue-Yellow-Purple.\n\nSimilarly, Red-Green must be adjacent, so they can be either Red-Green or Green-Red.\n\nNow, let's try to fit these into the shelf.\n\nLet me consider the positions:\n\n1. ?\n2. ?\n3. ?\n4. ?\n5. ?\n\nWe need to place Red-Green, Blue-Yellow, Purple-Yellow, and the fifth book.\n\nWait, but Blue-Yellow and Purple-Yellow both involve Yellow, so Yellow is shared between them. So, Yellow must be in the middle of Blue and Purple.\n\nSo, perhaps Blue-Yellow-Purple is a sequence.\n\nThen, Red-Green can be placed either before or after this sequence.\n\nLet me try:\n\nOption 1:\n\nBlue-Yellow-Purple and then Red-Green.\n\nSo, positions:\n\n1. Blue\n2. Yellow\n3. Purple\n4. Red\n5. Green\n\nNow, check adjacents:\n\n- Blue-Yellow: Good\n- Yellow-Purple: Good\n- Purple-Red: Purple is next to Red, but they are not complementary. Purple only needs to be next to Yellow. So, this is okay.\n- Red-Green: Good.\n\nNow, check references: Red and Yellow are references. In this arrangement, Yellow is at 2 and next to Blue (non-reference) and Purple (non-reference), so that's okay. Red is at 4, next to Purple (non-reference) and Green (non-reference). So, references are not adjacent, which is good.\n\nBut let's check the complementary pairs:\n\n- Red-Green: Adjacent and complementary.\n- Blue-Yellow: Adjacent and complementary.\n- Purple-Yellow: Adjacent and complementary.\n\nSo, this seems to satisfy all conditions.\n\nWait, but in this arrangement, Yellow is between Blue and Purple, and Red is next to Green, but Red is at position 4, which is next to Green at 5. That works because Red is a reference, and Green is a non-reference, so that's allowed.\n\nBut let me check the order again:\n\n1. Blue\n2. Yellow\n3. Purple\n4. Red\n5. Green\n\nReferences: Yellow (at 2) and Red (at 4). They are not adjacent, so that's okay.\n\nComplementary pairs:\n\n- Blue-Yellow: yes\n- Yellow-Purple: yes\n- Purple-Red: No, Purple only needs to be next to Yellow. So, Purple-Red is okay because the only requirement is that Purple is next to Yellow.\n\nWait, but Purple-Yellow is a complementary pair, so they must be adjacent. In this arrangement, Yellow is at 2 and Purple at 3, so they are adjacent. Then Purple is at 3, next to Yellow (2) and Red (4). Since Purple only needs to be next to Yellow, the adjacency to Red is fine.\n\nSimilarly, Blue is at 1, next to Yellow (2), which is good.\n\nRed is at 4, next to Purple (3) and Green (5). Red only needs to be next to Green, which is at 5. So, that's good.\n\nGreen is at 5, next to Red (4), which is correct.\n\nSo, this arrangement seems to work.\n\nBut let me check another possibility to make sure.\n\nOption 2:\n\nRed-Green at the beginning.\n\n1. Red\n2. Green\n3. Blue\n4. Yellow\n5. Purple\n\nNow, check adjacents:\n\n- Red-Green: Good\n- Green-Blue: Not complementary, which is a problem because Green should only be next to Red.\n\nSo, this doesn't work because Green is next to Blue, which is not allowed.\n\nOption 3:\n\nRed-Green somewhere else.\n\nSuppose we have Blue-Yellow-Purple in the middle.\n\nLet's try:\n\n1. Red\n2. Green\n3. Blue\n4. Yellow\n5. Purple\n\nBut again, Green is next to Blue, which is not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, let's try placing Red-Green after Blue-Yellow-Purple.\n\n1. Blue\n2. Yellow\n3. Purple\n4. Green\n5. Red\n\nNow, check:\n\n- Blue-Yellow: Good\n- Yellow-Purple: Good\n- Purple-Green: Not complementary. Purple needs to be next to Yellow, which it is at position 3. Then, Purple is next to Green at 4, which is not a problem because the only requirement is Purple-Yellow adjacency.\n\nBut Green is at 4, next to Purple (3) and Red (5). Green's only requirement is to be next to Red, which is at 5. So, that's good.\n\nRed is at 5, next to Green (4). Good.\n\nReferences: Yellow (2) and Red (5). They are not adjacent, so that's okay.\n\nComplementary pairs:\n\n- Blue-Yellow: Yes\n- Yellow-Purple: Yes\n- Purple-Green: No, but Purple only needs to be next to Yellow, so it's okay.\n\nWait, but Purple is at 3, next to Yellow (2) and Green (4). So, the only required adjacency is Yellow, which is satisfied. Green is at 4, next to Purple (3) and Red (5). Green only needs to be next to Red, which is at 5.\n\nSo, this arrangement also works.\n\nBut wait, in this case, Purple is next to Green, which is a non-reference, but that's allowed because the only restriction is that references can't be next to each other and the complementary pairs must be adjacent.\n\nAlternatively, another arrangement:\n\n1. Green\n2. Red\n3. Yellow\n4. Blue\n5. Purple\n\nLet's check:\n\n- Green-Red: Good\n- Red-Yellow: Red is a reference, Yellow is a reference, and they can't be next to each other. So, this is not allowed.\n\nSo, this arrangement is invalid because Red and Yellow are both references and are adjacent.\n\nAnother attempt:\n\n1. Blue\n2. Yellow\n3. Purple\n4. Red\n5. Green\n\nThis is similar to the first option I had. Let's check:\n\n- Blue-Yellow: Good\n- Yellow-Purple: Good\n- Purple-Red: Purple is okay here, as it's next to Yellow.\n- Red-Green: Good.\n\nReferences: Yellow (2) and Red (4). They are not adjacent, so okay.\n\nComplementary pairs:\n\n- Blue-Yellow: Yes\n- Yellow-Purple: Yes\n- Purple-Red: Not complementary, but allowed.\n- Red-Green: Yes.\n\nThis seems to work.\n\nBut let me check if there's another arrangement where the references are not placed at the ends.\n\nLet me try:\n\n1. Green\n2. Red\n3. Yellow\n4. Purple\n5. Blue\n\nWait, Green-Red: Good.\n\nRed-Yellow: Both references, can't be adjacent. So, invalid.\n\nAnother idea: Place the references with non-references in between.\n\nLet me try:\n\n1. Blue\n2. Yellow\n3. Purple\n4. Green\n5. Red\n\nCheck:\n\n- Blue-Yellow: Good\n- Yellow-Purple: Good\n- Purple-Green: Not complementary, but allowed.\n- Green-Red: Good.\n\nReferences: Yellow (2) and Red (5). They are not adjacent, so okay.\n\nComplementary pairs:\n\n- Blue-Yellow: Yes\n- Yellow-Purple: Yes\n- Purple-Green: No, but Purple only needs to be next to Yellow.\n- Red-Green: Yes.\n\nThis works.\n\nAlternatively, another arrangement:\n\n1. Purple\n2. Yellow\n3. Blue\n4. Red\n5. Green\n\nCheck:\n\n- Purple-Yellow: Good\n- Yellow-Blue: Good (since Blue-Yellow is a pair)\n- Blue-Red: Blue is a non-reference, Red is a reference. Okay.\n- Red-Green: Good.\n\nReferences: Yellow (2) and Red (4). They are not adjacent.\n\nComplementary pairs:\n\n- Purple-Yellow: Yes\n- Yellow-Blue: Yes\n- Blue-Red: Not complementary, but allowed.\n- Red-Green: Yes.\n\nThis also works.\n\nWait, but in this case, Yellow is at 2, next to Purple (1) and Blue (3). So, Yellow is between Purple and Blue, which is correct.\n\nBut Blue is at 3, next to Yellow (2) and Red (4). Blue is a non-reference, so it's okay to be next to Red.\n\nRed is at 4, next to Blue (3) and Green (5). Green is at 5, next to Red (4).\n\nSo, this arrangement is valid.\n\nBut let me see if I can find an arrangement where the references are not next to each other and all complementary pairs are together.\n\nAnother attempt:\n\n1. Red\n2. Green\n3. Yellow\n4. Purple\n5. Blue\n\nCheck:\n\n- Red-Green: Good\n- Green-Yellow: Green should only be next to Red. So, this is invalid.\n\nSo, Green can't be next to Yellow.\n\nAnother arrangement:\n\n1. Red\n2. Green\n3. Blue\n4. Yellow\n5. Purple\n\nCheck:\n\n- Red-Green: Good\n- Green-Blue: Invalid, as they are not complementary.\n\nSo, no.\n\nAnother idea: Place the references with non-references in between.\n\nLet me try:\n\n1. Blue\n2. Yellow\n3. Purple\n4. Red\n5. Green\n\nThis was one of the earlier arrangements and works.\n\nAlternatively:\n\n1. Blue\n2. Yellow\n3. Purple\n4. Green\n5. Red\n\nThis also works, as checked before.\n\nSo, to sum up, there are multiple valid arrangements, but one of them is:\n\n1. Blue\n2. Yellow\n3. Purple\n4. Red\n5. Green\n\nOr\n\n1. Blue\n2. Yellow\n3. Purple\n4. Green\n5. Red\n\nWait, in the second case, Green is at 4, next to Purple (3) and Red (5). So, that works because Green only needs to be next to Red.\n\nYes, that's valid.\n\nAlternatively, another arrangement could be:\n\n1. Purple\n2. Yellow\n3. Blue\n4. Red\n5. Green\n\nWhich also works.\n\nI think the key is to place the complementary pairs together and ensure that the references are not adjacent. Since Yellow is a reference, it can't be next to Red, so we have to make sure that when we place Yellow, it's not next to Red.\n\nIn the arrangement where we have Blue-Yellow-Purple, followed by Red-Green, that works because Yellow is between Blue and Purple, and then Red is placed after Purple, with Green after Red.\n\nAlternatively, placing Red-Green at the end, after Blue-Yellow-Purple.\n\nSo, to make it clear, one possible arrangement is:\n\n1. Blue\n2. Yellow\n3. Purple\n4. Red\n5. Green\n\nThis satisfies all conditions.\n\nAlternatively, another arrangement is:\n\n1. Blue\n2. Yellow\n3. Purple\n4. Green\n5. Red\n\nWhich also works.\n\nI think the librarian can choose either of these arrangements as they both satisfy the given conditions.\n</think>\n\nThe librarian can arrange the books as follows:\n\n1. Blue novel\n2. Yellow atlas\n3. Purple poetry collection\n4. Red dictionary\n5. Green cookbook\n\nThis arrangement ensures that complementary colors are next to each other and reference books are not adjacent.\n\nDONE."

    "solution": "Solve this problem step by step. End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: A librarian needs to arrange five books on a shelf: a red dictionary, a blue novel, a green cookbook, a yellow atlas, and a purple poetry collection. The library has a rule that reference books (like dictionaries and atlases) cannot be placed next to each other. Additionally, the librarian wants books of complementary colors to be placed next to each other (red-green, blue-yellow, and purple-yellow are complementary color pairs). How can the librarian arrange the books to satisfy both conditions? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I need to help arrange these five books on a shelf. The books are a red dictionary, a blue novel, a green cookbook, a yellow atlas, and a purple poetry collection. There are two main rules to follow:\n\n1. **Reference books (dictionaries and atlases) can't be placed next to each other.**\n2. **Books of complementary colors should be placed next to each other.** The complementary pairs are red-green, blue-yellow, and purple-yellow.\n\nFirst, I should figure out which books are reference and which are not. The red dictionary and the yellow atlas are both reference books. The blue novel, green cookbook, and purple poetry collection are likely fiction or non-reference books.\n\nSo, we have:\n- **Reference books:** Red dictionary (R), Yellow atlas (Y)\n- **Non-reference books:** Blue novel (B), Green cookbook (G), Purple poetry collection (P)\n\n**Rule 1:** R and Y can't be next to each other.\n\n**Rule 2:** Complementary pairs should be next to each other:\n- Red (R) and Green (G)\n- Blue (B) and Yellow (Y)\n- Purple (P) and Yellow (Y)\n\nWait, that's interesting. Purple pairs with Yellow, but Yellow is already a reference book. So, we have to make sure that Y is next to both B and P, but Y can't be next to R.\n\nLet me try to visualize the shelf. There are five positions:\n\n1. Position 1\n2. Position 2\n3. Position 3\n4. Position 4\n5. Position 5\n\nI need to place the books in such a way that R and Y aren't adjacent, and the complementary pairs are together.\n\nFirst, let's list the complementary pairs:\n\n- R-G\n- B-Y\n- P-Y\n\nSo, R must be next to G, B must be next to Y, and P must be next to Y.\n\nBut Y is a reference book, so it can't be next to R. Therefore, Y must be placed such that it's next to B and P but not next to R.\n\nLet me try to place Y in the middle. If Y is in position 3, then it can be adjacent to 2 and 4. But then, B and P need to be in 2 and 4, but they can't be next to each other because they both need to be next to Y. Wait, no, that's okay because both B and P can be next to Y.\n\nBut then, R and G need to be placed on either end, but R can't be next to Y. So if Y is in 3, then position 2 and 4 can be B and P. Then positions 1 and 5 can be R and G.\n\nBut wait, if Y is in 3, then position 2 is B and position 4 is P. Then, R and G would be in 1 and 5. But R is a reference book, and position 1 is next to position 2 (which is B, a non-reference). That's okay because R can be next to B. Similarly, G in position 5 is next to P in position 4, which is fine because G is a non-reference.\n\nSo, let's try that arrangement:\n\n1. R (dictionary)\n2. B (novel)\n3. Y (atlas)\n4. P (poetry)\n5. G (cookbook)\n\nNow, check the rules:\n\n- R is next to B (non-reference), which is fine.\n- B is next to Y (reference), which is okay because B is non-reference.\n- Y is next to B and P, both non-reference, which is okay.\n- P is next to Y and G. P is non-reference, G is non-reference, so that's fine.\n- G is next to P and R. G is non-reference, R is reference. Wait, G is next to R, but R is a reference book. Is that a problem? No, because the rule says reference books can't be next to each other, not that non-reference can't be next to reference. So that's okay.\n\nBut wait, R and G are complementary, so they should be next to each other, which they are in positions 1 and 5. But in this arrangement, R is at 1 and G is at 5, which are not adjacent. So that's a problem because the complementary pair R-G should be next to each other.\n\nAh, so my initial arrangement doesn't satisfy the complementary pair rule for R and G. I need to adjust that.\n\nLet me try placing R and G together. So, they can be in positions 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, or 4-5.\n\nBut Y is a reference book, so Y can't be next to R. So if R is next to G, and G is next to Y, that would mean R is next to G, and G is next to Y. But R can't be next to Y. So G can't be next to Y if R is next to G. Therefore, G can't be next to Y, which complicates things because B and P also need to be next to Y.\n\nAlternatively, maybe R and G can be placed together without being next to Y.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nLet's place R and G together somewhere not adjacent to Y.\n\nSuppose R and G are in positions 1 and 2. Then Y needs to be next to B and P. So Y could be in position 5, with B in 3 and P in 4. But then, Y is in 5, which is next to 4. Let's see:\n\n1. R\n2. G\n3. B\n4. P\n5. Y\n\nCheck adjacency:\n\n- R (1) next to G (2) \u2013 good.\n- G (2) next to R and B (3). G is non-reference, B is non-reference \u2013 okay.\n- B (3) next to G and P (4). B is non-reference, P is non-reference \u2013 okay.\n- P (4) next to B and Y (5). P is non-reference, Y is reference \u2013 okay.\n- Y (5) next to P (4) \u2013 okay.\n\nBut R is next to G, which is good, but Y is next to P, which is good, and B is next to Y? Wait, no, in this arrangement, Y is at 5, next to P at 4. B is at 3, next to P at 4, so B isn't directly next to Y. That's a problem because B needs to be next to Y.\n\nSo, that doesn't work. Let me try another arrangement.\n\nWhat if Y is in position 3, and B and P are on either side:\n\n1. ?\n2. B\n3. Y\n4. P\n5. ?\n\nNow, R and G need to be placed in positions 1 and 5. Let's try R in 1 and G in 5:\n\n1. R\n2. B\n3. Y\n4. P\n5. G\n\nCheck:\n\n- R (1) next to B (2): R is reference, B is non-reference \u2013 okay.\n- B (2) next to R and Y: B is non-reference, Y is reference \u2013 okay.\n- Y (3) next to B and P: both non-reference \u2013 okay.\n- P (4) next to Y and G: both non-reference \u2013 okay.\n- G (5) next to P and R: G is non-reference, R is reference \u2013 okay.\n\nNow, check complementary pairs:\n\n- R and G: R is at 1, G is at 5 \u2013 not adjacent. Problem.\n- B and Y: B is at 2, Y at 3 \u2013 adjacent. Good.\n- P and Y: P at 4, Y at 3 \u2013 adjacent. Good.\n\nSo, the issue is R and G are not next to each other. So, to fix this, maybe swap G and R.\n\nLet me try:\n\n1. G\n2. B\n3. Y\n4. P\n5. R\n\nCheck:\n\n- G (1) next to B (2): both non-reference \u2013 okay.\n- B (2) next to G and Y: okay.\n- Y (3) next to B and P: okay.\n- P (4) next to Y and R: P is non-reference, R is reference \u2013 okay.\n- R (5) next to P: okay.\n\nComplementary pairs:\n\n- R and G: R at 5, G at 1 \u2013 not adjacent. Problem.\n- B and Y: adjacent. Good.\n- P and Y: adjacent. Good.\n\nSame problem. So, R and G are not adjacent.\n\nHmm. Maybe I need to place R and G together, but not at the ends. Let's try placing them in the middle.\n\nSuppose positions 3 and 4 are R and G:\n\n1. ?\n2. ?\n3. R\n4. G\n5. ?\n\nBut then, Y needs to be next to B and P. Let's see:\n\nIf R is at 3, G at 4, then Y needs to be next to B and P. Let's place Y at 5, with B at 2 and P at 1.\n\nWait, but Y at 5 is next to G at 4. So:\n\n1. P\n2. B\n3. R\n4. G\n5. Y\n\nCheck adjacency:\n\n- P (1) next to B (2): both non-reference \u2013 okay.\n- B (2) next to P and R: B is non-reference, R is reference \u2013 okay.\n- R (3) next to B and G: R is reference, G is non-reference \u2013 okay.\n- G (4) next to R and Y: G is non-reference, Y is reference \u2013 okay.\n- Y (5) next to G and nothing else \u2013 okay.\n\nComplementary pairs:\n\n- R and G: adjacent. Good.\n- B and Y: B at 2, Y at 5 \u2013 not adjacent. Problem.\n- P and Y: P at 1, Y at 5 \u2013 not adjacent. Problem.\n\nSo, that's worse. B and Y are not adjacent, and P and Y are not adjacent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Y needs to be in the middle. Let's try:\n\n1. ?\n2. B\n3. Y\n4. P\n5. ?\n\nThen R and G need to be placed in 1 and 5.\n\nLet me try R at 1 and G at 5:\n\n1. R\n2. B\n3. Y\n4. P\n5. G\n\nCheck:\n\n- R (1) next to B (2): okay.\n- B (2) next to R and Y: okay.\n- Y (3) next to B and P: okay.\n- P (4) next to Y and G: okay.\n- G (5) next to P and R: okay.\n\nComplementary pairs:\n\n- R and G: not adjacent. Problem.\n- B and Y: adjacent. Good.\n- P and Y: adjacent. Good.\n\nSame issue as before.\n\nWhat if I swap R and G? G at 1 and R at 5:\n\n1. G\n2. B\n3. Y\n4. P\n5. R\n\nCheck:\n\n- G (1) next to B (2): okay.\n- B (2) next to G and Y: okay.\n- Y (3) next to B and P: okay.\n- P (4) next to Y and R: okay.\n- R (5) next to P: okay.\n\nComplementary pairs:\n\n- R and G: not adjacent. Problem.\n- B and Y: adjacent. Good.\n- P and Y: adjacent. Good.\n\nStill the same problem.\n\nMaybe I need to place R and G together but not at the ends. Let's try:\n\n1. B\n2. R\n3. G\n4. P\n5. Y\n\nCheck adjacency:\n\n- B (1) next to R (2): B is non-reference, R is reference \u2013 okay.\n- R (2) next to B and G: R is reference, G is non-reference \u2013 okay.\n- G (3) next to R and P: G is non-reference, P is non-reference \u2013 okay.\n- P (4) next to G and Y: okay.\n- Y (5) next to P: okay.\n\nComplementary pairs:\n\n- R and G: adjacent. Good.\n- B and Y: B at 1, Y at 5 \u2013 not adjacent. Problem.\n- P and Y: P at 4, Y at 5 \u2013 adjacent. Good.\n\nSo, B and Y are not adjacent, which is a problem. We need B to be next to Y.\n\nLet me try:\n\n1. B\n2. Y\n3. R\n4. G\n5. P\n\nCheck adjacency:\n\n- B (1) next to Y (2): good.\n- Y (2) next to B and R: Y is reference, R is reference \u2013 problem! Y and R can't be next to each other.\n\nSo, that's invalid.\n\nAnother try:\n\n1. P\n2. B\n3. Y\n4. R\n5. G\n\nCheck:\n\n- P (1) next to B (2): okay.\n- B (2) next to P and Y: okay.\n- Y (3) next to B and R: Y is reference, R is reference \u2013 problem.\n\nInvalid.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe place R and G together, and have Y adjacent to both B and P, but not next to R.\n\nLet me try:\n\n1. R\n2. G\n3. Y\n4. P\n5. B\n\nCheck adjacency:\n\n- R (1) next to G (2): good.\n- G (2) next to R and Y: okay.\n- Y (3) next to G and P: okay.\n- P (4) next to Y and B: okay.\n- B (5) next to P: okay.\n\nComplementary pairs:\n\n- R and G: adjacent. Good.\n- B and Y: B at 5, Y at 3 \u2013 not adjacent. Problem.\n- P and Y: P at 4, Y at 3 \u2013 adjacent. Good.\n\nSo, B and Y are not adjacent. Need to fix that.\n\nMaybe swap B and P:\n\n1. R\n2. G\n3. Y\n4. B\n5. P\n\nCheck:\n\n- R (1) next to G (2): good.\n- G (2) next to R and Y: okay.\n- Y (3) next to G and B: okay.\n- B (4) next to Y and P: okay.\n- P (5) next to B: okay.\n\nComplementary pairs:\n\n- R and G: adjacent. Good.\n- B and Y: adjacent. Good.\n- P and Y: P at 5, Y at 3 \u2013 not adjacent. Problem.\n\nSo, P and Y are not adjacent. Need to fix that.\n\nLet me try:\n\n1. R\n2. G\n3. Y\n4. P\n5. B\n\nWait, I tried this earlier. It didn't work because B and Y were not adjacent, but in this arrangement, Y is at 3, P at 4, and B at 5. So, Y is not next to B. So, that's no good.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Y needs to be in position 2.\n\nLet me try:\n\n1. R\n2. Y\n3. B\n4. P\n5. G\n\nCheck adjacency:\n\n- R (1) next to Y (2): R is reference, Y is reference \u2013 problem.\n\nInvalid.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe place Y between B and P, and R and G on either end, but ensure R is not next to Y.\n\nLet me try:\n\n1. R\n2. B\n3. Y\n4. P\n5. G\n\nWait, this is the same as earlier. R is at 1, next to B, which is okay. Y is at 3, next to B and P. R and G are at the ends, but R is at 1, G at 5. They are not adjacent, which is a problem.\n\nWait, maybe if I place R and G together in the middle:\n\n1. B\n2. R\n3. G\n4. P\n5.

    "solution": "Solve this problem step by step. End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: A librarian needs to arrange five books on a shelf: a red dictionary, a blue novel, a green cookbook, a yellow atlas, and a purple poetry collection. The library has a rule that reference books (like dictionaries and atlases) cannot be placed next to each other. Additionally, the librarian wants books of complementary colors to be placed next to each other (red-green, blue-yellow, and purple-yellow are complementary color pairs). How can the librarian arrange the books to satisfy both conditions? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this problem where a librarian needs to arrange five books on a shelf. The books are of different colors: red dictionary, blue novel, green cookbook, yellow atlas, and purple poetry collection. There are two main rules to follow. First, reference books, which are dictionaries and atlases, can't be placed next to each other. Second, books of complementary colors should be placed next to each other. The complementary pairs given are red-green, blue-yellow, and purple-yellow. Okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to identify which books are reference books. From the list, the red dictionary and the yellow atlas are reference books because a dictionary and an atlas are typically considered reference materials. The other books are blue novel, green cookbook, and purple poetry collection, which I assume are not reference books.\n\nSo, the first rule is that reference books can't be next to each other. That means the red dictionary and the yellow atlas can't be adjacent. I'll keep that in mind.\n\nThe second rule is about complementary colors. The pairs given are red-green, blue-yellow, and purple-yellow. So, red should be next to green, blue should be next to yellow, and purple should be next to yellow as well. Wait, that's interesting because both blue and purple want to be next to yellow. That might create a conflict because yellow can only be next to one book at a time.\n\nLet me list out the complementary pairs again to make sure I got them right: red-green, blue-yellow, and purple-yellow. So, red needs to be next to green, blue needs to be next to yellow, and purple needs to be next to yellow. That means yellow is involved in two complementary pairs, which might complicate things.\n\nI think a good starting point would be to consider the required adjacencies. Since red must be next to green, I can consider them as a pair. Similarly, blue must be next to yellow, and purple must be next to yellow. So, yellow is connected to both blue and purple, which means blue and purple must be on either side of yellow. But wait, if yellow is in the middle, then blue and purple can't both be next to yellow unless they are on either side.\n\nLet me try to visualize this. Let's say we have yellow somewhere on the shelf. To its left could be blue or purple, and to its right could be the other one. So, maybe something like [Blue]-Yellow-[Purple], but then blue would also need to be next to yellow, which is already satisfied. Similarly, purple would also be next to yellow. But then, red and green need to be next to each other as well.\n\nWait, but red and green are a separate pair, so they should be placed together too. So, maybe I can think of two separate pairs: red-green and blue-yellow-purple. But since blue and purple both need to be next to yellow, that forms a trio: blue-yellow-purple. But that might not work because we have only five books, and if we have a trio, we have to place the other two books somewhere else without violating the reference rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe red-green can be a pair, and blue and purple each need to be next to yellow, but since yellow can only be next to two books, blue and purple would have to be on either side of yellow, making it a trio: blue-yellow-purple. Then, the red and green would have to go somewhere else, but they also need to be next to each other.\n\nWait, but if blue, yellow, and purple are together, that's three books, and then red and green need to be next to each other, that's two more. So, total of five books. Maybe the arrangement could be something like [Blue]-Yellow-[Purple], with red and green somewhere else. But red and green need to be next to each other, so perhaps [Red]-Green and then the other three. But I'm not sure how to fit that without breaking the reference rule.\n\nWait, let's think about the reference rule. The reference books are red and yellow. So, they can't be next to each other. So, red and yellow can't be adjacent. That means wherever yellow is placed, the book next to it on either side can't be red. Similarly, red can't be next to yellow.\n\nSo, if I have the trio blue-yellow-purple, that's fine because blue and purple are not reference books. Then, red and green need to be next to each other, but they can't be next to any reference books. So, where can red and green go? They need to be placed such that they are next to each other and not adjacent to red or yellow.\n\nWait, red is a reference book, so it can't be next to yellow, but it can be next to blue, green, or purple. However, red needs to be next to green. So, red and green must be placed together, but not next to yellow.\n\nLet me try to sketch this out.\n\nOption 1:\n\nLet's try to place the trio blue-yellow-purple in the middle. So, positions 2-3-4: Blue, Yellow, Purple.\n\nThen, we have positions 1 and 5 left for red and green, but they need to be next to each other. So, if we put red in position 1 and green in position 5, then red and green are not adjacent, which violates the complementary rule. Alternatively, if we put green in position 1 and red in position 5, same problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can have red and green in positions 1-2 or 4-5, but position 2 is already occupied by yellow in this arrangement. So, that might not work.\n\nOption 2:\n\nMaybe place the trio blue-yellow-purple starting at position 1: Blue, Yellow, Purple.\n\nThen positions 4 and 5 are left for red and green. But again, red and green need to be next to each other, so if we put them in positions 4 and 5, they would be adjacent. But position 4 is next to position 3 (which is purple), and position 5 is next to position 4. So, if we have red in 4 and green in 5, red would be next to purple, which is okay, but green would be next to red, satisfying their complementary pair. However, we need to check the reference rule. Position 3 is purple, which is fine. Position 4 is red, which is a reference book. Position 5 is green. So, red (position 4) is next to purple (position 3), which is okay because purple is not a reference book. Green (position 5) is next to red, which is a reference book, but green is not a reference book, so that's okay. Also, yellow is in position 2, next to blue (position 1) and purple (position 3). Blue is not a reference book, so that's fine. Purple is also not a reference book, so that's fine. So, this arrangement would be: Blue, Yellow, Purple, Red, Green. Let's check all the rules.\n\n- Reference books: Red (position 4) and Yellow (position 2). They are not adjacent, so that's good.\n\n- Complementary pairs:\n\n  - Red and Green are next to each other (positions 4-5). Good.\n\n  - Blue and Yellow are next to each other (positions 1-2). Good.\n\n  - Purple and Yellow are next to each other (positions 2-3). Good.\n\nSo, this seems to satisfy all the conditions.\n\nWait, but in this arrangement, yellow is next to both blue and purple, which is allowed because yellow is a reference book but the rule is that reference books can't be next to each other. Wait, yellow is a reference book, and it's next to blue and purple, which are not reference books. So that's okay. The rule only prohibits reference books from being next to each other, not non-reference books.\n\nYes, so this arrangement works.\n\nAlternatively, let's see if there are other possible arrangements.\n\nOption 3:\n\nWhat if we place red and green together at the start? So, Red, Green, something else.\n\nBut then, red is a reference book, and green is not. So, after red and green, we can place another book. Let's say position 1: Red, position 2: Green. Then, position 3 needs to be something that is not a reference book. The remaining books are blue, yellow, purple.\n\nIf we place yellow in position 3, then green (position 2) is next to yellow (position 3). But green and yellow are not complementary. The complementary pairs are red-green, blue-yellow, purple-yellow. So, green and yellow are not a pair, so that's okay. Then, position 4 could be blue or purple. If we place blue in position 4, then yellow (position 3) is next to blue (position 4). But blue and yellow are a complementary pair, so that's good. Then, position 5 would be purple. So, the arrangement would be Red, Green, Yellow, Blue, Purple.\n\nLet's check the rules.\n\n- Reference books: Red (position 1) and Yellow (position 3). They are not adjacent, so that's fine.\n\n- Complementary pairs:\n\n  - Red and Green are next to each other (positions 1-2). Good.\n\n  - Blue and Yellow are next to each other (positions 4-5). Wait, no, position 4 is blue, position 5 is purple. So, blue is next to yellow (position 3) and purple (position 4). So, blue is next to yellow, which is good. Purple is next to blue, but purple and blue are not complementary. Purple needs to be next to yellow, which is in position 3. So, purple is next to blue (position 4) and yellow (position 3). So, purple is next to yellow, which is good.\n\nWait, in this arrangement, purple is in position 5, next to blue (position 4) and yellow (position 3). So, purple is next to yellow, which is good. Blue is next to yellow, which is good. Red and green are next to each other, good. Reference books are not adjacent, good. So, this seems to work too.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check. Position 1: Red, 2: Green, 3: Yellow, 4: Blue, 5: Purple.\n\n- Red (1) next to Green (2): good.\n\n- Green (2) next to Yellow (3): not complementary, but that's okay because the only required pairs are red-green, blue-yellow, and purple-yellow.\n\n- Yellow (3) next to Blue (4): good (blue-yellow).\n\n- Yellow (3) next to Purple (5): but wait, position 5 is purple, which is not adjacent to yellow. Because position 3 is yellow, position 4 is blue, position 5 is purple. So, yellow is only next to green (position 2) and blue (position 3). Wait, no, position 3 is yellow, position 4 is blue, so yellow is next to blue, which is good. But purple is in position 5, next to blue (position 4). So, purple is not next to yellow in this arrangement. That's a problem because purple needs to be next to yellow.\n\nSo, in this arrangement, purple is not next to yellow, which violates the complementary rule. Therefore, this arrangement doesn't work.\n\nSo, that means the previous option where we had Blue, Yellow, Purple, Red, Green works because purple is next to yellow, and blue is next to yellow. Also, red and green are next to each other, and the reference books are not adjacent.\n\nAnother option: Let's try placing the trio blue-yellow-purple in the middle.\n\nPositions 2-3-4: Blue, Yellow, Purple.\n\nThen, positions 1 and 5 are red and green. But red and green need to be next to each other, so if we put them in positions 1 and 2, but position 2 is blue, which is not a reference book, but red is a reference book. Wait, no, position 1 and 2: position 1 is red, position 2 is blue. But red is a reference book, blue is not, so that's okay. But red and green need to be next to each other. So, if position 1 is red, position 2 is blue, then green can't be in position 2. Alternatively, position 1: red, position 2: green, but position 2 is blue, which is conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, position 5: green, position 4: red. So, positions 4 and 5: red and green. But position 4 is purple, so can't have red there because purple is a non-reference book. Wait, position 4 is purple, so we can't have red in position 4. Therefore, this arrangement might not work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe place the trio at the end: Yellow, Blue, Purple in positions 3-4-5.\n\nThen, positions 1-2 are red and green. But red and green need to be next to each other, so they can't be in positions 1 and 2 unless they are adjacent. So, if position 1 is red, position 2 is green, but then position 3 is yellow, which is a reference book. So, red (position 1) is next to green (position 2), which is good. Then, position 3 is yellow, which is next to green (position 2). But green is not a reference book, so that's okay. Then, position 4 is blue, next to yellow (position 3). Good. Position 5 is purple, next to blue (position 4). But purple needs to be next to yellow, which is in position 3, but position 5 is not adjacent to position 3. So, that's a problem.\n\nSo, in this arrangement, purple is not next to yellow, which violates the rule.\n\nAlternatively, if we have the trio at the start: Blue, Yellow, Purple in positions 1-2-3.\n\nThen, positions 4 and 5 are red and green. But red and green need to be next to each other, so they can't be in positions 4 and 5 unless they are adjacent. So, position 4: red, position 5: green. But red is a reference book, and green is not, so that's okay. But red and green are next to each other, which is good. However, position 3 is purple, which is next to position 4: red. Purple is not a reference book, so that's fine. But then, yellow is in position 2, next to blue (position 1) and purple (position 3). So, that's okay.\n\nWait, but in this arrangement, red is in position 4, next to purple (position 3). Purple is not a reference book, so that's okay. Green is in position 5, next to red (position 4). Good.\n\nBut let's check all the rules:\n\n- Reference books: Yellow (position 2) and Red (position 4). They are not adjacent, so that's good.\n\n- Complementary pairs:\n\n  - Red and Green are next to each other (positions 4-5). Good.\n\n  - Blue and Yellow are next to each other (positions 1-2). Good.\n\n  - Purple and Yellow are next to each other (positions 2-3). Good.\n\nSo, this arrangement also works: Blue, Yellow, Purple, Red, Green.\n\nWait, but this is the same as the first option I had. So, that's a valid arrangement.\n\nAnother possibility: Let's try to have red and green in the middle.\n\nPositions 3-4: Red, Green.\n\nThen, the remaining positions are 1, 2, 5: Blue, Yellow, Purple.\n\nWe need to arrange Blue, Yellow, Purple in positions 1,2,5 such that Blue is next to Yellow, Purple is next to Yellow, and no reference books are adjacent.\n\nSo, positions 1,2,5: Let's try to place Blue, Yellow, Purple.\n\nIf we place Yellow in position 2, then Blue can be in position 1, and Purple in position 5.\n\nSo, arrangement: Blue, Yellow, Red, Green, Purple.\n\nWait, position 3 is Red, position 4 is Green.\n\nBut let's check:\n\n- Reference books: Red (position 3) and Yellow (position 2). They are adjacent (positions 2-3), which violates the rule because reference books can't be next to each other.\n\nSo, that's not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, place Yellow in position 5, but then Blue and Purple need to be next to it. So, position 5: Yellow.\n\nThen, position 4 would have to be Blue or Purple, but position 4 is Green in this arrangement. So, that doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, place Yellow in position 1, but then we need Blue and Purple next to it. So, position 1: Yellow.\n\nThen, position 2: Blue, position 3: Purple.\n\nBut position 3 is Red, which conflicts. So, that doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, position 1: Blue, position 2: Yellow, position 5: Purple.\n\nSo, arrangement: Blue, Yellow, Red, Green, Purple.\n\nAgain, position 2: Yellow is next to position 3: Red, which is a reference book, so that's not allowed.\n\nTherefore, this approach doesn't work.\n\nSo, from the above, the valid arrangements are:\n\n1. Blue, Yellow, Purple, Red, Green.\n\n2. Red, Green, Yellow, Blue, Purple (but this had a problem with purple not being next to yellow).\n\nWait, no, earlier I thought of another arrangement where Blue, Yellow, Purple, Red, Green works, and another where Red, Green, Yellow, Blue, Purple didn't work because purple wasn't next to yellow. So, the only valid ones are the first two where the trio is Blue-Yellow-Purple with Red and Green on either end, ensuring that Red and Green are next to each other and not adjacent to reference books.\n\nWait, but in the first arrangement, Blue, Yellow, Purple, Red, Green, the reference books are Yellow and Red. They are not adjacent because Yellow is in position 2, and Red is in position 4. So, positions 2 and 4 are separated by position 3 (Purple), so they are not adjacent. That's good.\n\nIn the second arrangement, Blue, Yellow, Purple, Red, Green, same thing.\n\nAlternatively, could we have another arrangement where the trio is at the end?\n\nLike, positions 3-4-5: Blue, Yellow, Purple.\n\nThen, positions 1-2: Red, Green.\n\nBut then, position 2 is Green, which is next to position 3: Blue. That's okay, but Red is in position 1, next to Green (position 2). So, arrangement: Red, Green, Blue, Yellow, Purple.\n\nCheck the rules:\n\n- Reference books: Red (1) and Yellow (3)."

    "solution": "Solve this problem step by step. End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: A librarian needs to arrange five books on a shelf: a red dictionary, a blue novel, a green cookbook, a yellow atlas, and a purple poetry collection. The library has a rule that reference books (like dictionaries and atlases) cannot be placed next to each other. Additionally, the librarian wants books of complementary colors to be placed next to each other (red-green, blue-yellow, and purple-yellow are complementary color pairs). How can the librarian arrange the books to satisfy both conditions? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I need to help the librarian arrange these five books on a shelf. The books are a red dictionary, a blue novel, a green cookbook, a yellow atlas, and a purple poetry collection. There are two main rules to follow:\n\n1. **Reference books cannot be placed next to each other.** The reference books here are the dictionary and the atlas. So, they can't be adjacent.\n\n2. **Complementary colors should be placed next to each other.** The complementary pairs are red-green, blue-yellow, and purple-yellow. That means red should be next to green, blue next to yellow, and purple next to yellow.\n\nOkay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's list out all the books with their colors:\n\n- Red (dictionary)\n- Blue (novel)\n- Green (cookbook)\n- Yellow (atlas)\n- Purple (poetry collection)\n\nNow, the complementary pairs are:\n\n- Red and Green\n- Blue and Yellow\n- Purple and Yellow\n\nSo, red must be next to green, blue must be next to yellow, and purple must be next to yellow.\n\nBut wait, purple is also paired with yellow, which is already paired with blue. So, purple and yellow are a pair, and blue and yellow are another pair. That means yellow has two complementary pairs: blue and purple. But since yellow can only be adjacent to two books (one on each side), it can only be next to either blue or purple, not both. Hmm, that's a conflict. Maybe I need to clarify that.\n\nWait, the problem says \"complementary color pairs.\" It doesn't specify that each color can have multiple pairs. But looking at the given pairs: red-green, blue-yellow, and purple-yellow. So, red is only paired with green, blue is only paired with yellow, and purple is only paired with yellow. So, yellow is paired with both blue and purple. But in reality, a book can only have one neighbor on each side, so yellow can be next to either blue or purple, but not both. That might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the librarian can place yellow between blue and purple, satisfying both pairs. So, blue next to yellow, and yellow next to purple. That way, both blue-yellow and purple-yellow pairs are satisfied. That could work.\n\nSo, let's try to visualize the shelf. Since we have five books, the shelf will have five positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.\n\nWe need to arrange the books so that the reference books (dictionary and atlas) are not next to each other, and the complementary colors are next to each other.\n\nFirst, let's consider the complementary pairs:\n\n- Red (dictionary) must be next to Green (cookbook)\n- Blue (novel) must be next to Yellow (atlas)\n- Purple (poetry) must be next to Yellow (atlas)\n\nSo, Yellow is paired with both Blue and Purple. That suggests that Yellow needs to be between Blue and Purple, but since Yellow can only be next to two books, it can't be adjacent to both. Therefore, perhaps the arrangement should have Blue next to Yellow, and Yellow next to Purple, meaning Blue, Yellow, Purple in a sequence.\n\nBut then, Red and Green need to be next to each other as well. So, perhaps the shelf will have Red next to Green, and Blue, Yellow, Purple in another part.\n\nLet me try to sketch this out.\n\nOne possible structure is:\n\n[Red - Green] [Blue - Yellow - Purple] [something]\n\nBut since we have five books, the middle position would be position 3.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps:\n\n[Blue - Yellow - Purple] [Red - Green] [something]\n\nBut we need to place the fifth book, which is the other reference book, the atlas, but wait, the dictionary is red, and the atlas is yellow. Oh, wait, the reference books are the dictionary (red) and the atlas (yellow). So, they can't be next to each other.\n\nWait, that complicates things because yellow is both a reference book and part of the complementary pairs.\n\nSo, the reference books are red (dictionary) and yellow (atlas). They cannot be next to each other. So, we need to ensure that red and yellow are not adjacent.\n\nBut yellow is also part of the complementary pairs with blue and purple. So, yellow has to be next to blue and/or purple, but not red.\n\nSo, let's try to structure this.\n\nWe need to place red and green together, blue and yellow together, and purple and yellow together.\n\nBut since yellow can't be next to red, and yellow needs to be next to both blue and purple, but that's impossible because yellow can only have two neighbors.\n\nSo, perhaps the solution is to have yellow between blue and purple, satisfying both pairs, and then have red and green somewhere else.\n\nLet me try to outline the positions.\n\nLet's say positions 1 to 5.\n\nOption 1:\n\n1: Red (dictionary)\n\n2: Green (cookbook)\n\n3: Blue (novel)\n\n4: Yellow (atlas)\n\n5: Purple (poetry)\n\nBut let's check the pairs:\n\n- Red and Green are together (good)\n\n- Blue and Yellow are together (good)\n\n- Purple and Yellow are together (good)\n\nBut now, the reference books are Red and Yellow. Are they next to each other? Let's see: Red is at 1, Yellow is at 4. They are not adjacent, so that's okay.\n\nWait, but in this arrangement, the reference books are not next to each other, and all complementary pairs are together. Let me check:\n\n1: Red\n\n2: Green (next to Red, good)\n\n3: Blue (next to Yellow, good)\n\n4: Yellow (next to Blue and Purple, good)\n\n5: Purple (next to Yellow, good)\n\nSo, this seems to satisfy all conditions.\n\nBut let's verify:\n\n- Reference books: Red (1) and Yellow (4). They are not next to each other. Good.\n\n- Complementary pairs:\n\n  - Red and Green (1-2): yes.\n\n  - Blue and Yellow (3-4): yes.\n\n  - Purple and Yellow (4-5): yes.\n\nSo, this works.\n\nAlternatively, another arrangement could be:\n\n1: Blue\n\n2: Yellow\n\n3: Purple\n\n4: Red\n\n5: Green\n\nBut let's check:\n\n- Blue and Yellow together (good)\n\n- Purple and Yellow together (good)\n\n- Red and Green together (good)\n\nReference books: Blue is a novel, not a reference book. Reference books are Red (dictionary) and Yellow (atlas). Are they next to each other? Red is at 4, Yellow at 2. Not adjacent. Good.\n\nBut wait, in this arrangement, Yellow is between Blue and Purple, and Red is next to Green at the end. So, this also works.\n\nBut the first arrangement I thought of was:\n\n1: Red\n\n2: Green\n\n3: Blue\n\n4: Yellow\n\n5: Purple\n\nThat also works.\n\nAlternatively, another arrangement could be:\n\n1: Green\n\n2: Red\n\n3: Yellow\n\n4: Blue\n\n5: Purple\n\nBut in this case, Red is next to Green (good), Yellow is next to Red (bad, because Yellow is a reference book and can't be next to Red). So, this is invalid.\n\nSo, the valid arrangements are those where Red and Green are together, Blue and Yellow are together, Purple and Yellow are together, and Red and Yellow are not adjacent.\n\nSo, the two valid arrangements I found are:\n\n1. Red, Green, Blue, Yellow, Purple\n\n2. Blue, Yellow, Purple, Red, Green\n\nWait, but in the second arrangement, Red is at position 4, Green at 5. So, they are next to each other, good. Also, Blue is at 1, Yellow at 2: good. Purple at 3, Yellow at 2: but Yellow is next to both Blue and Purple, which is fine because the pair is Blue-Yellow and Purple-Yellow.\n\nWait, but in this arrangement:\n\n1: Blue\n\n2: Yellow\n\n3: Purple\n\n4: Red\n\n5: Green\n\nThis works because:\n\n- Blue and Yellow together.\n\n- Purple and Yellow together (but Yellow is at 2, Purple at 3: yes, together.\n\n- Red and Green together at 4-5.\n\nReference books: Yellow (atlas) and Red (dictionary). They are at positions 2 and 4, not adjacent. Good.\n\nSo, both arrangements are valid.\n\nBut let's see if there are more.\n\nAnother possibility:\n\n1: Yellow\n\n2: Blue\n\n3: Purple\n\n4: Green\n\n5: Red\n\nBut let's check:\n\n- Yellow and Blue together (good)\n\n- Purple and Yellow: Purple is at 3, Yellow at 1: not adjacent. So, bad.\n\nSo, that doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively:\n\n1: Yellow\n\n2: Purple\n\n3: Blue\n\n4: Red\n\n5: Green\n\nCheck:\n\n- Yellow and Purple together (good)\n\n- Blue and Yellow: Blue is at 3, Yellow at 1: not adjacent. Bad.\n\nSo, invalid.\n\nAnother try:\n\n1: Green\n\n2: Red\n\n3: Yellow\n\n4: Purple\n\n5: Blue\n\nCheck:\n\n- Green and Red together (good)\n\n- Yellow and Purple together (good)\n\n- Blue and Yellow: Blue is at 5, Yellow at 3: not adjacent. Bad.\n\nSo, invalid.\n\nAlternatively:\n\n1: Red\n\n2: Green\n\n3: Yellow\n\n4: Purple\n\n5: Blue\n\nCheck:\n\n- Red and Green together (good)\n\n- Yellow and Purple together (good)\n\n- Blue and Yellow: Blue at 5, Yellow at 3: not adjacent. Bad.\n\nSo, invalid.\n\nAnother attempt:\n\n1: Blue\n\n2: Yellow\n\n3: Red\n\n4: Green\n\n5: Purple\n\nCheck:\n\n- Blue and Yellow (good)\n\n- Yellow and Red: Red is at 3, Yellow at 2: adjacent. Bad, because Yellow is a reference book and can't be next to Red.\n\nSo, invalid.\n\nAnother idea:\n\n1: Purple\n\n2: Yellow\n\n3: Blue\n\n4: Red\n\n5: Green\n\nCheck:\n\n- Purple and Yellow (good)\n\n- Blue and Yellow (good)\n\n- Red and Green (good)\n\nReference books: Yellow (2) and Red (4): not adjacent. Good.\n\nSo, this works.\n\nSo, this is another valid arrangement.\n\nSimilarly, we can have:\n\n1: Purple\n\n2: Yellow\n\n3: Blue\n\n4: Green\n\n5: Red\n\nBut then Red is at 5, Green at 4: good.\n\nCheck:\n\n- Purple and Yellow (good)\n\n- Yellow and Blue (good)\n\n- Red and Green (good)\n\nReference books: Yellow (2) and Red (5): not adjacent. Good.\n\nYes, that works.\n\nSo, now we have multiple valid arrangements, but the key is to place the complementary pairs together without having the reference books next to each other.\n\nBut to make it simple, let's choose one arrangement.\n\nLet me go back to the first one I thought of:\n\n1: Red\n\n2: Green\n\n3: Blue\n\n4: Yellow\n\n5: Purple\n\nThis satisfies all conditions.\n\nAlternatively, the arrangement starting with Blue:\n\n1: Blue\n\n2: Yellow\n\n3: Purple\n\n4: Red\n\n5: Green\n\nThis also works.\n\nSimilarly, starting with Purple:\n\n1: Purple\n\n2: Yellow\n\n3: Blue\n\n4: Red\n\n5: Green\n\nAlso works.\n\nSo, there are multiple solutions.\n\nBut the problem is to provide one possible solution.\n\nSo, I can choose any of these.\n\nLet me pick the first one:\n\nRed, Green, Blue, Yellow, Purple\n\nSo, the shelf would look like:\n\n1: Red dictionary\n\n2: Green cookbook\n\n3: Blue novel\n\n4: Yellow atlas\n\n5: Purple poetry collection\n\nCheck:\n\n- Reference books: Red (1) and Yellow (4). Not adjacent.\n\n- Complementary pairs:\n\n  - Red and Green (1-2)\n\n  - Blue and Yellow (3-4)\n\n  - Purple and Yellow (4-5)\n\nWait, but in this arrangement, Yellow is next to both Blue and Purple, which is allowed because the rule is that complementary color pairs should be next to each other. So, as long as each pair is adjacent, it's okay if a book is part of multiple pairs.\n\nSo, yes, this works.\n\nAlternatively, the other arrangement starting with Blue:\n\n1: Blue\n\n2: Yellow\n\n3: Purple\n\n4: Red\n\n5: Green\n\nCheck:\n\n- Reference books: Blue is not a reference, Yellow (atlas) and Red (dictionary). They are at positions 2 and 4, not adjacent.\n\n- Complementary pairs:\n\n  - Blue and Yellow (1-2)\n\n  - Purple and Yellow (2-3)\n\n  - Red and Green (4-5)\n\nThis also works.\n\nSo, either arrangement is valid.\n\nBut to make it clear, perhaps the first one is simpler.\n\nSo, the librarian can arrange the books as:\n\nRed dictionary, Green cookbook, Blue novel, Yellow atlas, Purple poetry collection.\n\nDONE.\n</think>\n\nThe librarian can arrange the books as follows:\n\n1. Red dictionary\n2. Green cookbook\n3. Blue novel\n4. Yellow atlas\n5. Purple poetry collection\n\nThis arrangement satisfies both conditions: reference books are not next to each other, and complementary colors are placed together.\n\nDONE."

The library has a rule that reference books (like dictionaries and atlases) cannot be placed next to each other. Additionally, the librarian wants books of complementary colors to be placed next to each other (red-green, blue-yellow, and purple-yellow are complementary color pairs). How can the librarian arrange the books to satisfy both conditions? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I need to help arrange these five books on a shelf. Let's see, the books are: a red dictionary, a blue novel, a green cookbook, a yellow atlas, and a purple poetry collection. \n\nFirst, I should note the rules. The first rule is that reference books (which are dictionaries and atlases) can't be placed next to each other. So, the red dictionary and the yellow atlas are both reference books, so they can't be next to each other. \n\nThe second rule is about complementary colors. The problem says that books of complementary colors should be placed next to each other. The complementary pairs given are red-green, blue-yellow, and purple-yellow. So, red should be next to green, blue should be next to yellow, and purple should be next to yellow as well.\n\nWait, but purple is also paired with yellow? That's interesting because both blue and purple are paired with yellow. So, yellow is paired with both blue and purple. That might complicate things a bit because yellow can't be next to both at the same time, but maybe it can be placed between them in some way.\n\nLet me list out the books with their colors:\n\n1. Red (dictionary)\n2. Blue (novel)\n3. Green (cookbook)\n4. Yellow (atlas)\n5. Purple (poetry collection)\n\nNow, the complementary pairs are:\n\n- Red and Green\n- Blue and Yellow\n- Purple and Yellow\n\nSo, each of these pairs should be adjacent. That means Red must be next to Green, Blue must be next to Yellow, and Purple must be next to Yellow.\n\nBut wait, Yellow is involved in two pairs: Blue-Yellow and Purple-Yellow. So, Yellow needs to be next to both Blue and Purple. That might mean that Yellow is in the middle, with Blue on one side and Purple on the other.\n\nAlso, Red and Green must be next to each other.\n\nSo, perhaps the arrangement could have Red and Green together, and then Yellow in the middle, with Blue and Purple on either side.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the reference books (Red and Yellow) are not next to each other.\n\nLet me try to visualize this.\n\nLet me denote the books as R (Red), B (Blue), G (Green), Y (Yellow), P (Purple).\n\nSo, R and G must be together. Let's say R is next to G.\n\nSimilarly, B and Y must be together, and Y and P must be together.\n\nSo, perhaps Y is in the middle, with B on one side and P on the other.\n\nSo, something like: ... B - Y - P ...\n\nAnd R and G together somewhere else.\n\nBut we have to arrange all five books on the shelf, so the total number is five. Let me try to place them.\n\nLet me try to sketch a possible arrangement.\n\nStart with R and G together. So, R - G.\n\nThen, Y needs to be next to both B and P. So, maybe after G, we can have Y, then B and P.\n\nBut wait, G is a cookbook, which is not a reference book, so it's fine to be next to Y (which is a reference book).\n\nWait, but Y is a reference book, and G is not. So, G can be next to Y.\n\nSo, R - G - Y.\n\nThen, Y needs to be next to B and P. So, perhaps Y is between B and P.\n\nSo, R - G - Y - B - P.\n\nBut now, let's check the adjacency:\n\n- R and G are together (good).\n- Y is between B and P (good).\n- Now, check the reference books: R and Y. They are not adjacent, which is fine because they can't be next to each other.\n\nWait, but in this arrangement, R is at the beginning, G is next, then Y, then B, then P.\n\nSo, R and Y are two positions apart, which is fine.\n\nBut let's see if all the complementary pairs are adjacent.\n\n- R and G: yes.\n- B and Y: yes, they are next to each other.\n- Y and P: yes, they are next to each other.\n\nWait, but the problem says complementary pairs are R-G, B-Y, and P-Y. So, all three pairs need to be adjacent.\n\nBut in this arrangement, R-G-Y-B-P, R and G are adjacent, Y and B are adjacent, Y and P are adjacent. So, all three pairs are adjacent.\n\nBut wait, in this case, Y is between B and P, so Y is next to both, which satisfies both B-Y and P-Y.\n\nSo, that works.\n\nBut let's check if the reference books are not next to each other.\n\nR is next to G, which is fine because G is not a reference book.\n\nY is next to B and P, which are both non-reference books, so that's okay.\n\nR and Y are not next to each other, which is good.\n\nSo, this arrangement seems to satisfy both conditions.\n\nBut let me think if there's another possible arrangement.\n\nAlternatively, maybe starting with B-Y-P.\n\nSo, B - Y - P.\n\nThen, R and G need to be together somewhere else.\n\nSo, perhaps R - G - somewhere.\n\nBut since we have five books, the total arrangement would be B - Y - P - something - something.\n\nSo, let's see:\n\nB - Y - P - R - G.\n\nBut in this case, R and G are at the end, so R is next to G, which is good.\n\nBut now, check the adjacency:\n\n- B and Y: good.\n- Y and P: good.\n- R and G: good.\n\nBut also, check if any reference books are next to each other.\n\nY is a reference book, and P is a poetry collection, which is not a reference book, so that's okay.\n\nR is a reference book, and G is not, so that's okay.\n\nSo, in this arrangement, B - Y - P - R - G.\n\nThis also satisfies all conditions.\n\nBut wait, in this arrangement, R is next to G, which is good, and Y is next to B and P, which is also good.\n\nBut let me check if all the complementary pairs are adjacent.\n\n- R and G: yes.\n- B and Y: yes.\n- P and Y: yes.\n\nSo, all three pairs are adjacent.\n\nBut wait, in this case, P is next to Y and R.\n\nBut P is purple, which is only supposed to be next to yellow.\n\nSo, P is next to Y, which is good, but P is also next to R, which is red.\n\nBut red is not a complementary color of purple, so that's okay because the rule is only about the specified complementary pairs.\n\nSo, P can be next to Y and R; it's only required to be next to Y, not necessarily not next to R.\n\nSo, that's acceptable.\n\nBut let's see another possible arrangement.\n\nAlternatively, maybe start with R - G - Y - P - B.\n\nSo, R - G - Y - P - B.\n\nIn this case:\n\n- R and G: good.\n- G and Y: G is green, Y is yellow, which are complementary (R-G and G-Y? Wait, no, the complementary pairs are R-G, B-Y, and P-Y.\n\nSo, G-Y is not a complementary pair. Wait, no, the problem says complementary pairs are R-G, B-Y, and P-Y.\n\nSo, G-Y is not a complementary pair. So, in this arrangement, G is next to Y, which is not required.\n\nBut the rule is that complementary pairs should be placed next to each other, but non-complementary pairs can be next to each other as well.\n\nSo, that's acceptable.\n\nBut let's check the adjacency of reference books.\n\nR is a reference book, G is not, so R-G is okay.\n\nY is a reference book, next to G (non-reference), then Y next to P (non-reference), and then Y next to B (non-reference). So, Y is only next to non-reference books, which is fine.\n\nSo, in this arrangement, R - G - Y - P - B.\n\nBut wait, the complementary pairs:\n\n- R and G: yes.\n- B and Y: yes, they are at the end, but they are next to each other? No, B is at the end, so Y is next to P and B is next to Y? Wait, in this arrangement, Y is next to P and B is next to Y. So, Y is between P and B, which are both non-reference books.\n\nWait, but in this arrangement, B is at the end, so Y is next to P and B is next to Y. So, B and Y are adjacent, which is good.\n\nSimilarly, Y and P are adjacent, which is good.\n\nSo, all complementary pairs are adjacent.\n\nBut let's check if R and Y are adjacent. R is at the beginning, G is next, then Y, so R and Y are two apart, which is fine because they are not adjacent.\n\nSo, this arrangement also works.\n\nBut I need to make sure that all the complementary pairs are adjacent, regardless of where they are in the shelf.\n\nSo, in this case, all three pairs are adjacent.\n\nBut let me think if there's a better arrangement.\n\nAlternatively, maybe start with Y in the middle.\n\nSo, something like B - Y - P - G - R.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nB - Y - P - G - R.\n\nIn this case:\n\n- B and Y: adjacent.\n- Y and P: adjacent.\n- P and G: not a complementary pair.\n- G and R: adjacent, which is good.\n\nBut check the adjacency of reference books.\n\nY is a reference book, next to B (non-reference), P (non-reference), and G (non-reference). So, that's fine.\n\nR is a reference book at the end, next to G (non-reference), which is fine.\n\nSo, this arrangement also works.\n\nBut let's check the complementary pairs:\n\n- B and Y: yes.\n- Y and P: yes.\n- G and R: yes.\n\nSo, all three pairs are adjacent.\n\nBut wait, in this arrangement, G is next to R, which is good, but G is also next to P, which is not a complementary pair. That's okay because the rule is only about the specified pairs.\n\nSo, this works too.\n\nBut let me check another possibility.\n\nWhat if we have P next to Y and R next to G, but Y is in between B and P, and G is next to Y.\n\nWait, maybe:\n\nB - Y - P - R - G.\n\nSo, B - Y - P - R - G.\n\nIn this case:\n\n- B and Y: adjacent.\n- Y and P: adjacent.\n- P and R: not a complementary pair.\n- R and G: adjacent.\n\nBut check the adjacency of reference books.\n\nY is next to B and P, which are non-reference, so fine.\n\nR is next to P (non-reference) and G (non-reference), but R is a reference book, so that's okay.\n\nG is next to R (reference) and is not a reference book, so that's okay.\n\nSo, this arrangement is also acceptable.\n\nBut let's see if all complementary pairs are adjacent.\n\n- B and Y: yes.\n- Y and P: yes.\n- R and G: yes.\n\nSo, all three pairs are adjacent.\n\nBut in this arrangement, P is next to R, which is not a complementary pair, but that's allowed.\n\nSo, this works.\n\nAlternatively, maybe start with R - G - Y - B - P.\n\nSo, R - G - Y - B - P.\n\nIn this case:\n\n- R and G: adjacent.\n- G and Y: not a complementary pair, but allowed.\n- Y and B: adjacent.\n- B and P: not a complementary pair, but allowed.\n\nCheck the adjacency of reference books.\n\nR is next to G (non-reference), Y is next to G and B (non-reference), so fine.\n\nP is next to B (non-reference), which is okay.\n\nSo, this arrangement is also acceptable.\n\nBut let's check the complementary pairs:\n\n- R and G: yes.\n- Y and B: yes.\n- Y and P: yes.\n\nWait, Y is next to B and P, so Y is adjacent to both, satisfying both complementary pairs.\n\nSo, this arrangement works.\n\nBut let me see if I can find another arrangement.\n\nWhat if I have Y in the middle, with B and P on either side, and then R and G on the ends.\n\nSo, B - Y - P - G - R.\n\nWait, that's similar to what I had before.\n\nAlternatively, R - Y - G - B - P.\n\nWait, but Y is a reference book, and R is a reference book, so they can't be next to each other.\n\nSo, R - Y - G - B - P would have R and Y adjacent, which is not allowed.\n\nSo, that's invalid.\n\nSimilarly, if I try to place R next to Y, that's invalid.\n\nSo, I need to make sure that R and Y are not next to each other.\n\nSo, in all the previous arrangements, R and Y were not next to each other, so that's fine.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nSince R and G must be together, and Y must be between B and P, perhaps the arrangement is something like:\n\nG - R - B - Y - P.\n\nBut let's check.\n\nG - R: good, they are together.\n\nR - B: R is red, B is blue. They are not a complementary pair, so that's allowed.\n\nB - Y: good, they are a complementary pair.\n\nY - P: good, they are a complementary pair.\n\nSo, in this case:\n\n- R and G: adjacent.\n- B and Y: adjacent.\n- Y and P: adjacent.\n\nBut R is next to B, which is okay, but R is a reference book, and B is not, so that's fine.\n\nBut let's check the adjacency of reference books.\n\nR is next to G (non-reference) and B (non-reference), which is okay.\n\nY is next to B (non-reference) and P (non-reference), which is okay.\n\nSo, this arrangement is acceptable.\n\nBut wait, in this arrangement, R is next to B, which is not a complementary pair, but that's allowed.\n\nSo, this works.\n\nBut let me see if I can find a more optimal arrangement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps start with Y in the middle.\n\nSo, something like B - Y - P - R - G.\n\nWait, that's similar to earlier.\n\nBut in this case:\n\n- B and Y: adjacent.\n- Y and P: adjacent.\n- P and R: not a complementary pair.\n- R and G: adjacent.\n\nSo, that's acceptable.\n\nBut let me check if there's an arrangement where R and G are together, and Y is between B and P, but also ensuring that R and Y are not next to each other.\n\nWait, I think the arrangement R - G - Y - B - P works because R and Y are not adjacent.\n\nSimilarly, G - R - Y - B - P also works.\n\nAlternatively, B - Y - P - R - G.\n\nBut in all these cases, the key is to have R and G together, and Y between B and P, making sure that Y is adjacent to both B and P.\n\nAdditionally, making sure that R and Y are not next to each other.\n\nSo, perhaps the simplest arrangement is R - G - Y - B - P.\n\nLet me check:\n\n- R and G: adjacent (complementary).\n- G and Y: G is green, Y is yellow, which are complementary? Wait, no, the complementary pairs are R-G, B-Y, and P-Y. So, G-Y is not a complementary pair, but that's okay because the rule is that complementary pairs should be adjacent, but non-complementary pairs can also be adjacent.\n\nSo, that's acceptable.\n\n- Y and B: adjacent (complementary).\n- B and P: not a complementary pair, but allowed.\n\nWait, but the complementary pairs are B-Y and P-Y, so B-Y and Y-P are both adjacent, which is good.\n\nSo, in this arrangement, R - G - Y - B - P.\n\nCheck the adjacency:\n\n- R and G: yes.\n- G and Y: not complementary, but allowed.\n- Y and B: yes.\n- B and P: not complementary, but allowed.\n\nAlso, check the reference books:\n\n- R is next to G (non-reference), Y is next to G and B (non-reference), so Y is fine.\n- P is next to B (non-reference), so fine.\n\nSo, this works.\n\nAlternatively, another arrangement could be G - R - Y - P - B.\n\nSo, G - R - Y - P - B.\n\nIn this case:\n\n- G and R: adjacent (complementary).\n- R and Y: R is a reference book, Y is a reference book. Oh, wait! R and Y can't be next to each other because both are reference books.\n\nSo, this arrangement is invalid because R and Y are adjacent, which is not allowed.\n\nSo, that's a mistake.\n\nTherefore, the arrangement G - R - Y - P - B is invalid because R and Y are next to each other, which is not permitted.\n\nSo, I need to avoid that.\n\nTherefore, the valid arrangements are those where R and Y are not adjacent.\n\nSo, the previous arrangement R - G - Y - B - P is valid because R and Y are two apart.\n\nSimilarly, B - Y - P - R - G is also valid because R and Y are not adjacent.\n\nBut let me think if there's a more optimal arrangement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps start with Y in the middle.\n\nSo, something like B - Y - P - G - R.\n\nSo, B - Y - P - G - R.\n\nIn this case:\n\n- B and Y: adjacent.\n- Y and P: adjacent.\n- P and G: not a complementary pair, but allowed.\n- G and R: adjacent.\n\nCheck the adjacency of reference books.\n\nY is next to B and P, which are non-reference, so fine.\n\nR is next to G (non-reference), so fine.\n\nSo, this arrangement is acceptable.\n\nBut let me check the complementary pairs:\n\n- B and Y: yes.\n- Y and P: yes.\n- G and R: yes.\n\nSo, all three pairs are adjacent.\n\nBut in this arrangement, P is next to G, which is not a complementary pair, but that's allowed.\n\nSo, this works.\n\nBut I think the key is to have R and G together, and Y between B and P, making sure that R and Y are not adjacent.\n\nSo, the possible valid arrangements are:\n\n1. R - G - Y - B - P\n2. B - Y - P - R - G\n3. B - Y - P - G - R\n4. G - R - Y - B - P (invalid because R and Y are adjacent)\n5. R - G - Y - P - B (valid)\n6. P - Y - B - R - G (invalid because R and G are not together)\n\nWait, no, in arrangement 5: R - G - Y - P - B, R and G are together, Y is next to P, and B is at the end"
