  "question": "A man walks into a restaurant, sits down, and orders albatross soup. After taking one sip, he immediately runs outside and jumps off a cliff, ending his life. Why did he commit suicide after tasting the soup?",
  "answer": "This requires looking beyond literal interpretations to understand the metaphorical connection:\n\n1. The key insight is that the soup is the trigger but not the direct cause.\n2. The man had previously been in a shipwreck and stranded on an island with other survivors.\n3. During this time, his companion (the ship's cook) had been feeding him what he claimed was 'albatross meat' to keep him alive.\n4. In reality, the cook had been feeding him the flesh of other survivors who had died or whom he had killed.\n5. Years later, when the man tasted actual albatross soup in the restaurant, he immediately realized that what he had eaten on the island was not albatross at all.\n6. This sudden realization that he had unknowingly engaged in cannibalism was so horrifying that he took his own life.\n\nThe solution requires thinking beyond the immediate facts presented and constructing a metaphorical narrative that connects the unusual elements of the story in a way that makes psychological sense."
