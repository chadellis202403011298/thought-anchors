  "question": "A health researcher is studying the relationship between daily coffee consumption and sleep quality in adults. They collected observational data from 1000 participants and found that people who drink 3+ cups of coffee daily report worse sleep quality on average than those who drink less coffee. The researcher wants to determine if reducing coffee consumption would actually improve sleep quality.\n\nWhich of the following approaches would allow the researcher to best establish a causal relationship between coffee consumption and sleep quality?\n\nA) Collect more observational data from an additional 1000 participants\nB) Run a randomized controlled experiment where one group is instructed to reduce their coffee intake\nC) Survey participants about why they drink coffee and analyze those motivations\nD) Compare sleep quality between coffee drinkers and people who have never consumed coffee",
  "answer": "The correct answer is B) Run a randomized controlled experiment where one group is instructed to reduce their coffee intake.\n\nStep 1: Recognize the limitations of observational data. The original study only shows a correlation between coffee consumption and sleep quality. This correlation could be due to many factors: perhaps poor sleep causes people to drink more coffee, or a third factor (like stress or work schedule) affects both coffee consumption and sleep quality.\n\nStep 2: Understand that to establish causality, we need to perform an intervention. This is the core principle of intervention analysis in causal reasoning. By actively changing one variable (coffee consumption) and observing the effect on another variable (sleep quality), we can better determine if there's a causal relationship.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate each option:\n- Option A just collects more observational data, which won't help establish causality any better than the original data.\n- Option B involves an intervention (reducing coffee intake) in a randomized controlled setting, which is the gold standard for establishing causal relationships.\n- Option C might provide insights about confounding variables but doesn't involve any intervention to test causality.\n- Option D still involves only observational data comparing different groups, not an intervention.\n\nStep 4: Conclude that option B is best because a randomized controlled experiment:\n1. Includes a deliberate intervention (reducing coffee)\n2. Uses randomization to balance confounding variables between groups\n3. Can establish a counterfactual (what would happen to the same people if they changed their coffee consumption)\n\nThis approach directly tests the causal hypothesis that reducing coffee consumption improves sleep quality."
