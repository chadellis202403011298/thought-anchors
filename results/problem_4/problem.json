  "question": "Jasmine makes the following statement: 'If I go to the beach, then I will wear sunscreen or a hat.' Today, Jasmine went to the beach but did not wear sunscreen. Based on her statement, what can you conclude with certainty?",
  "answer": "To solve this problem, I need to analyze the logical structure of Jasmine's statement and determine what we can conclude given the information provided.\n\nJasmine's statement can be written as: If B, then (S or H), where:\n- B = 'Jasmine goes to the beach'\n- S = 'Jasmine wears sunscreen'\n- H = 'Jasmine wears a hat'\n\nWe know that:\n1. Jasmine went to the beach (B is true)\n2. Jasmine did not wear sunscreen (S is false)\n\nApplying the conditional statement 'If B, then (S or H)':\nSince B is true, the consequent (S or H) must also be true.\nSince S is false, for (S or H) to be true, H must be true.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude with certainty that Jasmine wore a hat.\n\nThis follows from the logic of the conditional statement and the disjunction (OR) in the consequent. When one part of an OR statement is false, the other part must be true for the entire statement to be true."
