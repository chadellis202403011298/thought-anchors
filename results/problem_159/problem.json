  "question": "A man lives on the 10th floor of a building. Every morning he takes the elevator down to the ground floor to go to work. When he returns in the evening, he takes the elevator to the 7th floor and walks up the stairs to reach his apartment on the 10th floor. However, on rainy days and when there are other people in the elevator, he goes directly to the 10th floor. Why does he normally get off on the 7th floor?",
  "answer": "The man is too short to reach the button for the 10th floor in the elevator. He can only reach as high as the 7th floor button.\n\nThe reasoning process:\n1. First, we need to identify what's unusual about the scenario: Why would someone regularly choose to walk up three flights of stairs?\n2. We look for patterns in the exceptions: On rainy days and when others are in the elevator, he goes directly to the 10th floor.\n3. The key insight comes from asking: What's different about these situations? When others are in the elevator, someone else can press the 10th floor button for him.\n4. The rain connection becomes clear: On rainy days, he likely carries an umbrella, which he can use to reach the higher button.\n5. This points to a height limitation - the man is short and cannot reach the 10th floor button, but can reach the 7th floor button.\n\nThis problem requires lateral thinking because the solution isn't immediately obvious from the stated facts. We need to step outside conventional problem-solving approaches and consider physical limitations that aren't explicitly mentioned in the problem."
