  "question": "A researcher wants to determine if a new educational app improves math test scores for elementary school students. They select 100 students from a local school and randomly assign 50 students to use the app for 4 weeks, while the other 50 students continue with their regular math curriculum without the app. At the end of the 4 weeks, both groups take the same math test. The group that used the app scored an average of 85%, while the control group scored an average of 75%. \n\nWhich of the following is a potential confounding variable that the researcher's experimental design has successfully addressed?\n\nA) The educational backgrounds of the students' parents\nB) The students' initial level of interest in mathematics\nC) The natural variation in mathematical ability among students\nD) The amount of time the students spent practicing math each day",
  "answer": "The correct answer is C) The natural variation in mathematical ability among students.\n\nStep 1: Understand what a confounding variable is - it's a variable that influences both the independent variable (app usage) and the dependent variable (test scores), potentially creating a false association.\n\nStep 2: Examine the experimental design - the researcher randomly assigned students to either the app group or the control group. Random assignment is a powerful technique in experimental design that helps distribute participant characteristics evenly between groups.\n\nStep 3: Analyze each potential confounding variable:\n\nA) Educational backgrounds of parents - Random assignment would likely distribute students with different parental backgrounds evenly between groups, addressing this potential confounder.\n\nB) Initial interest in mathematics - Random assignment would likely distribute students with different levels of interest evenly between groups, addressing this potential confounder.\n\nC) Natural variation in mathematical ability - Random assignment would likely distribute students with different mathematical abilities evenly between groups, addressing this potential confounder.\n\nD) Amount of time spent practicing math - This is part of the intervention itself (students using the app versus following the regular curriculum), so it's not a confounding variable but rather a component of the treatment being studied.\n\nStep 4: Determine which option is correctly identified as a confounding variable that was addressed - Options A, B, and C are all potential confounding variables addressed through random assignment. However, the question asks for a confounding variable the experimental design successfully addressed, and the most direct one is C (natural variation in mathematical ability), as this directly relates to the outcome measure (math test scores).\n\nThe random assignment in this experiment helps ensure that the differences in math ability that naturally exist among students are distributed evenly between the treatment and control groups, strengthening the causal conclusion that the app itself led to the improved scores."
