The shape consists of filled squares at positions (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), and (3,2). If this shape is reflected across the vertical line x=2 (which runs through the middle of the grid), what positions will be filled in the reflected shape? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I've got this problem here about a shape on a 5x5 grid. The grid goes from (0,0) at the bottom-left to (4,4) at the top-right. The shape is made up of filled squares at positions (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), and (3,2). Now, I need to figure out where these filled squares will end up after reflecting the shape across the vertical line x=2. Hmm, okay, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I should probably visualize the grid to understand where these squares are initially. So, if I imagine a 5x5 grid, the x-coordinate increases from left to right, and the y-coordinate increases from bottom to top. That means (0,0) is the bottom-left corner, and (4,4) is the top-right.\n\nNow, the filled squares are at (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), and (3,2). Let me plot these mentally:\n\n- (1,1): That's one unit to the right and one unit up from the origin.\n- (1,2): One unit right, two units up.\n- (2,1): Two units right, one unit up.\n- (3,2): Three units right, two units up.\n\nSo, these squares form a sort of diagonal shape, maybe like a step or a small cluster. Okay, got it.\n\nNext, the reflection is across the vertical line x=2. That line runs straight up the middle of the grid, splitting it into two halves. So, points to the left of x=2 will mirror to the right, and vice versa. The reflection over a vertical line affects the x-coordinate, leaving the y-coordinate unchanged.\n\nI remember that reflecting a point (a,b) across a vertical line x=c results in the point (2c - a, b). So, in this case, since the line is x=2, c=2. Therefore, the reflected x-coordinate will be 2*2 - a = 4 - a. The y-coordinate remains the same.\n\nSo, I can apply this reflection formula to each of the original points to find their positions after reflection.\n\nLet me list out the original points again:\n\n1. (1,1)\n2. (1,2)\n3. (2,1)\n4. (3,2)\n\nNow, let's apply the reflection formula to each.\n\nStarting with (1,1):\n\nReflected x-coordinate = 4 - 1 = 3\nReflected y-coordinate = 1\nSo, the reflected point is (3,1)\n\nNext, (1,2):\n\nReflected x = 4 - 1 = 3\nReflected y = 2\nSo, (3,2)\n\nWait, that's interesting. The original (3,2) will reflect to where?\n\n(3,2):\n\nReflected x = 4 - 3 = 1\nReflected y = 2\nSo, (1,2)\n\nAnd (2,1):\n\nReflected x = 4 - 2 = 2\nReflected y = 1\nSo, (2,1)\n\nWait a minute, so reflecting (1,1) gives (3,1), reflecting (1,2) gives (3,2), reflecting (3,2) gives (1,2), and reflecting (2,1) gives (2,1).\n\nSo, after reflection, the filled squares will be at (3,1), (3,2), (1,2), and (2,1).\n\nWait, but I need to make sure I'm not missing anything. Let me double-check each reflection.\n\nFor (1,1): 4 - 1 = 3, y=1. Correct.\n\nFor (1,2): 4 - 1 = 3, y=2. Correct.\n\nFor (2,1): 4 - 2 = 2, y=1. Correct.\n\nFor (3,2): 4 - 3 = 1, y=2. Correct.\n\nSo, the reflected points are indeed (3,1), (3,2), (1,2), and (2,1).\n\nBut wait, I should visualize this to ensure it makes sense. The original shape is on the left side of the grid, near the bottom. After reflection, it should appear on the right side, symmetrical across x=2.\n\nOriginal points:\n\n- (1,1): Left side, one unit up from the bottom.\n- (1,2): Left side, two units up.\n- (2,1): Middle-left, one unit up.\n- (3,2): Right side, two units up.\n\nAfter reflection:\n\n- (3,1): Right side, one unit up from the bottom.\n- (3,2): Right side, two units up.\n- (1,2): Left side, same as before, but mirrored on the right.\n- (2,1): Middle-right, one unit up.\n\nSo, the reflected shape is a mirror image of the original across x=2. That seems correct.\n\nI think I've covered all the points and double-checked each reflection. So, the final positions should be (3,1), (3,2), (1,2), and (2,1).\n</think>\n\nThe reflected shape will have filled squares at positions (3,1), (3,2), (1,2), and (2,1).\n\nDONE."

The shape consists of filled squares at positions (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), and (3,2). If this shape is reflected across the vertical line x=2 (which runs through the middle of the grid), what positions will be filled in the reflected shape? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I've got this problem here about a shape on a 5\u00d75 grid, and I need to figure out where it ends up after reflecting it across the vertical line x=2. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I want to visualize the grid. It's a 5x5 grid, so that means it has 5 rows and 5 columns, making 25 positions in total. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom-left corner to (4,4) at the top-right corner. So, the grid looks like this:\n\n```\n(4,4) (3,4) (2,4) (1,4) (0,4)\n(4,3) (3,3) (2,3) (1,3) (0,3)\n(4,2) (3,2) (2,2) (1,2) (0,2)\n(4,1) (3,1) (2,1) (1,1) (0,1)\n(4,0) (3,0) (2,0) (1,0) (0,0)\n```\n\nBut wait, the problem mentions the bottom-left is (0,0) and the top-right is (4,4). So, actually, the coordinates increase as we go up and to the right, which is a bit different from the usual Cartesian plane where y increases upwards. So, I need to be careful with that.\n\nNow, the shape is made up of filled squares at positions (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), and (3,2). Let me plot these on the grid to visualize them better.\n\n- (1,1): This is one unit to the right and one unit up from the origin. So, it's in the second column and second row.\n- (1,2): One unit right, two units up. So, second column, third row.\n- (2,1): Two units right, one unit up. Third column, second row.\n- (3,2): Three units right, two units up. Fourth column, third row.\n\nSo, if I imagine connecting these points, it looks like a sort of \"L\" shape but with an extra square. Let me sketch it mentally:\n\n- Starting at (1,1), moving right to (1,2), then right again to (2,1), and then right again to (3,2). Hmm, that seems a bit disjointed. Maybe it's better to think of it as a 2x2 square missing one corner? Let me check.\n\nWait, actually, (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), and (3,2) don't form a solid shape. They're four separate points, so maybe it's just four individual squares connected diagonally? Or perhaps it's a polygonal shape. But the problem says it's a shape, so probably connected.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the coordinates. Let me make sure. In grid problems, sometimes the first coordinate is y and the second is x, but here the problem specifies (x,y). So, (1,1) is column 1, row 1, which is the second column from the left and second row from the bottom.\n\nSo, plotting these points:\n\n- (1,1): Column 1, Row 1\n- (1,2): Column 1, Row 2\n- (2,1): Column 2, Row 1\n- (3,2): Column 3, Row 2\n\nConnecting these, it's like a vertical line from (1,1) to (1,2), then a diagonal to (2,1), then another diagonal to (3,2). Hmm, that doesn't form a closed shape. Maybe it's four separate squares connected in a specific way. Or perhaps it's a 2x2 square missing one corner. Let me see.\n\nIf I think of the squares as being filled, then (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), and (3,2) would form a sort of \"staircase\" shape. From (1,1) up to (1,2), then right to (2,1), then right to (3,2). Wait, that's not a closed shape. Maybe it's a polygon where each point is a corner.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to consider each filled square individually and see how they move when reflected.\n\nBut before that, I need to understand what reflection across the vertical line x=2 means. A vertical line x=2 runs through the middle of the grid, so it's the line that goes from (2,0) to (2,4). Reflecting a point across this line means that the x-coordinate is mirrored over x=2, while the y-coordinate remains the same.\n\nSo, for any point (a,b), its reflection across x=2 would be (4 - a, b). Because the distance from a to 2 must equal the distance from 4 - a to 2. For example, if a point is at x=1, its reflection would be at x=3 (since 2 - 1 = 1, and 4 - 1 = 3). Similarly, a point at x=2 would stay at x=2 because it's on the line of reflection.\n\nSo, reflection across x=2 changes the x-coordinate to 4 - x, while y remains the same.\n\nNow, the original shape has filled squares at (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), and (3,2). Let's reflect each of these across x=2.\n\n- (1,1): Reflects to (4 - 1, 1) = (3,1)\n- (1,2): Reflects to (4 - 1, 2) = (3,2)\n- (2,1): Reflects to (4 - 2, 1) = (2,1) because 2 is on the line of reflection.\n- (3,2): Reflects to (4 - 3, 2) = (1,2)\n\nSo, after reflection, the filled squares would be at (3,1), (3,2), (2,1), and (1,2). Wait, but that's the same set of points as the original shape. Is that correct?\n\nWait, let me double-check. The original shape is at (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (3,2). After reflection, (1,1) becomes (3,1), (1,2) becomes (3,2), (2,1) stays at (2,1), and (3,2) becomes (1,2). So, the reflected shape has squares at (3,1), (3,2), (2,1), and (1,2). So, it's the same as the original shape but mirrored across the vertical line x=2.\n\nBut wait, is that accurate? Let me think about the positions. The original shape is on the left side of the grid, and the reflection would be on the right side. So, the shape should move from the left to the right side of the grid, maintaining the same orientation relative to the vertical line.\n\nSo, the reflected shape would have squares at (3,1), (3,2), (2,1), and (1,2). Wait, but (2,1) is on the line of reflection, so it remains the same. So, yes, that makes sense.\n\nBut let me visualize this. The original shape is:\n\n- (1,1): bottom row, second column\n- (1,2): second row, second column\n- (2,1): second row, third column\n- (3,2): third row, fourth column\n\nAfter reflection, it's:\n\n- (3,1): third row, second column\n- (3,2): third row, third column\n- (2,1): second row, third column (stays the same)\n- (1,2): second row, second column\n\nWait, that seems a bit confusing. Maybe it's better to think of the reflection as swapping the left and right sides across x=2.\n\nSo, the original shape is on the left side, and the reflection would be on the right side. So, each point (x,y) becomes (4 - x, y).\n\nSo, let's apply that:\n\n- (1,1) becomes (3,1)\n- (1,2) becomes (3,2)\n- (2,1) becomes (2,1)\n- (3,2) becomes (1,2)\n\nSo, the reflected shape has points at (3,1), (3,2), (2,1), and (1,2).\n\nWait, but that seems to be the same as the original shape but mirrored. So, the reflected shape is the mirror image of the original across x=2.\n\nBut I need to make sure that I'm not missing anything. Let me think about the grid again.\n\nOriginal positions:\n\n- (1,1): Column 1, Row 1\n- (1,2): Column 1, Row 2\n- (2,1): Column 2, Row 1\n- (3,2): Column 3, Row 2\n\nReflected positions:\n\n- (3,1): Column 3, Row 1\n- (3,2): Column 3, Row 2\n- (2,1): Column 2, Row 1 (since it's on the reflection line)\n- (1,2): Column 1, Row 2\n\nWait, but (1,2) was in the original shape, but now it's in the reflected shape. Similarly, (3,1) and (3,2) were not in the original shape but are now in the reflected shape.\n\nSo, the reflected shape is on the right side of the grid, with the same relative positions as the original on the left side.\n\nSo, the filled squares after reflection are at (1,2), (2,1), (3,1), and (3,2).\n\nWait, but in the reflection, (1,2) becomes (3,2), right? Because (1,2) reflects to (3,2). Similarly, (3,2) reflects to (1,2). So, both (1,2) and (3,2) are swapped.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1) reflects to (3,1), and (3,2) reflects to (1,2). Wait, but (3,2) was in the original shape, so after reflection, it's at (1,2).\n\nSo, the reflected shape has:\n\n- (3,1) from (1,1)\n- (3,2) from (1,2)\n- (2,1) remains (2,1)\n- (1,2) from (3,2)\n\nSo, the filled squares are at (3,1), (3,2), (2,1), and (1,2).\n\nWait, but that seems like the reflected shape is the same as the original shape but mirrored. So, the shape is symmetric across x=2.\n\nBut let me confirm. Let me list the original and reflected points:\n\nOriginal: (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (3,2)\n\nReflected: (3,1), (3,2), (2,1), (1,2)\n\nSo, the reflected shape is at (3,1), (3,2), (2,1), (1,2). So, in terms of positions, it's the mirror image across x=2.\n\nTherefore, the filled squares after reflection are at positions (1,2), (2,1), (3,1), and (3,2).\n\nWait, but I need to make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me think about each point:\n\n- (1,1) reflects to (3,1)\n- (1,2) reflects to (3,2)\n- (2,1) reflects to (2,1)\n- (3,2) reflects to (1,2)\n\nSo, the reflected points are (3,1), (3,2), (2,1), and (1,2). So, the shape is now on the right side of the grid, mirrored.\n\nTherefore, the positions filled in the reflected shape are (1,2), (2,1), (3,1), and (3,2).\n\nWait, but I think I might have confused myself. Let me try to list them again:\n\nOriginal points: (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (3,2)\n\nAfter reflection:\n\n- (1,1) \u2192 (3,1)\n- (1,2) \u2192 (3,2)\n- (2,1) stays at (2,1)\n- (3,2) \u2192 (1,2)\n\nSo, the reflected shape has points at (3,1), (3,2), (2,1), and (1,2).\n\nSo, the filled positions are (1,2), (2,1), (3,1), and (3,2).\n\nBut wait, (1,2) was in the original shape, but now it's in the reflected shape. Similarly, (3,1) and (3,2) were not in the original shape but are now in the reflected shape.\n\nSo, the reflected shape is the mirror image of the original across x=2, and its filled positions are (1,2), (2,1), (3,1), and (3,2).\n\nBut let me think about this again. Maybe I should write down each point and its reflection.\n\nLet me make a table:\n\nOriginal Point | Reflected Point\n---------------|-----------------\n(1,1)          | (3,1)\n(1,2)          | (3,2)\n(2,1)          | (2,1)\n(3,2)          | (1,2)\n\nSo, the reflected shape has points at (3,1), (3,2), (2,1), and (1,2). Therefore, the filled positions in the reflected shape are these four points.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure that I'm not missing any other points. The original shape has four points, and after reflection, it's also four points. So, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about the shape as a polygon and see how it looks after reflection.\n\nBut considering that reflection is a transformation where each point is mirrored across the line x=2, and given that, the reflected shape's points are as I listed above.\n\nTherefore, the filled positions in the reflected shape are (1,2), (2,1), (3,1), and (3,2).\n\nWait, but in the reflected shape, (1,2) and (3,2) are swapped, and (1,1) and (3,1) are swapped. So, the shape is mirrored across x=2.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, to sum it up, the reflected shape has filled squares at positions (1,2), (2,1), (3,1), and (3,2).\n\nBut let me double-check by visualizing. The original shape is on the left side, and after reflection, it's on the right side, maintaining the same relative positions.\n\nSo, (1,1) becomes (3,1), which is on the right side, same row as (1,1). Similarly, (1,2) becomes (3,2), which is on the right side, same row as (1,2). (2,1) stays at (2,1), which is in the middle, and (3,2) becomes (1,2), which is on the left side but now in the reflected shape on the right side.\n\nWait, no, (3,2) reflects to (1,2), which is on the left side. But in the reflected shape, the left side becomes the right side, so (1,2) in the original becomes (3,2) in the reflected. Similarly, (3,2) becomes (1,2) in the reflected.\n\nSo, in the reflected shape, the filled squares are at (3,1), (3,2), (2,1), and (1,2). Therefore, the positions are:\n\n- (1,2): second row, second column\n- (2,1): second row, third column\n- (3,1): third row, second column\n- (3,2): third row, third column\n\nSo, plotting these, it's like a shape that's on the right side, similar to the original on the left.\n\nTherefore, the filled positions in the reflected shape are (1,2), (2,1), (3,1), and (3,2).\n\nI think that's correct. So, the final answer is these four positions.\n</think>\n\nThe reflected shape will have filled squares at positions (1,2), (2,1), (3,1), and (3,2).\n\nSo, the positions are (1,2), (2,1), (3,1), and (3,2).\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n(1,2), (2,1), (3,1), and (3,2).\n\nSo, the filled positions are \\boxed{(1,2)}, \\boxed{(2,1)}, \\boxed{(3,1)}, and \\boxed{(3,2)}.\n\nBut wait, the problem asks for the positions in the reflected shape, so I need to present them as a list.\n\nThe positions are (1,2), (2,1), (3,1), and (3,2).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n\\boxed{(1,2)}, \\boxed{(2,1)}, \\boxed{(3,1)}, and \\boxed{(3,2)}.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to list them all together as a set.\n\nThe reflected shape has filled squares at the positions \\boxed{(1,2)}, \\boxed{(2,1)}, \\boxed{(3,1)}, and \\boxed{(3,2)}.\n\nSo, DONE."

The shape consists of filled squares at positions (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), and (3,2). If this shape is reflected across the vertical line x=2 (which runs through the middle of the grid), what positions will be filled in the reflected shape? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this problem where there's a shape on a 5x5 grid. The grid goes from (0,0) at the bottom-left to (4,4) at the top-right. The shape is made up of filled squares at positions (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), and (3,2). I need to figure out where these squares will end up after reflecting the shape across the vertical line x=2. \n\nFirst, I should visualize the grid. It's a 5x5 grid, so each side has 5 units, labeled from 0 to 4. The vertical line x=2 is right in the middle, so it splits the grid into two equal parts: left side from x=0 to x=2 and right side from x=2 to x=4.\n\nReflection across a vertical line like x=2 means that each point (x, y) will be mapped to a new point (x', y), where x' is the mirror image across x=2. To find the reflection of a point, I can use the formula for reflection over a vertical line. The formula is:\n\nx' = 2 * 2 - x\n\nBecause the line is at x=2, so the distance from the original point to the line is 2 - x, and the reflection would be the same distance on the other side, so x' = 2 + (2 - x) = 4 - x.\n\nWait, let me think about that again. If I have a point at x=1, the distance from x=1 to x=2 is 1 unit. So the reflection should be 1 unit on the other side of x=2, which would be x=3. Similarly, a point at x=3 would reflect to x=1. A point at x=2 would stay the same because it's on the line of reflection.\n\nSo, the formula for reflection across x=2 is x' = 4 - x. Got it.\n\nNow, let's list out the original points:\n\n1. (1,1)\n2. (1,2)\n3. (2,1)\n4. (3,2)\n\nI'll reflect each of these points across x=2 using the formula x' = 4 - x.\n\nStarting with (1,1):\n\nx = 1, so x' = 4 - 1 = 3. So the reflected point is (3,1).\n\nNext, (1,2):\n\nx = 1, so x' = 4 - 1 = 3. Reflected point is (3,2).\n\nThird point, (2,1):\n\nx = 2, so x' = 4 - 2 = 2. Reflected point is (2,1). Since it's on the line of reflection, it stays the same.\n\nLastly, (3,2):\n\nx = 3, so x' = 4 - 3 = 1. Reflected point is (1,2).\n\nSo after reflecting, the new points are:\n\n1. (3,1)\n2. (3,2)\n3. (2,1)\n4. (1,2)\n\nLet me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. For each original point, I calculated the reflection across x=2. \n\n- (1,1) reflects to (3,1) because 4 - 1 = 3.\n- (1,2) reflects to (3,2) because 4 - 1 = 3.\n- (2,1) stays at (2,1) because it's on the line.\n- (3,2) reflects to (1,2) because 4 - 3 = 1.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So the reflected shape will have filled squares at (3,1), (3,2), (2,1), and (1,2).\n</think>\n\nThe reflected shape across the vertical line x=2 will have filled squares at positions (1,2), (2,1), (3,1), and (3,2).\n\n**Answer:** The reflected shape will have filled squares at positions \\boxed{(1,2)}, \\boxed{(2,1)}, \\boxed{(3,1)}, and \\boxed{(3,2)}.\n\nDONE."

End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: A shape is placed on a 5\u00d75 grid, with the bottom-left corner of the grid being position (0,0) and the top-right corner being position (4,4). The shape consists of filled squares at positions (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), and (3,2). If this shape is reflected across the vertical line x=2 (which runs through the middle of the grid), what positions will be filled in the reflected shape? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this problem where there's a 5x5 grid, and a shape is placed on it. The grid's bottom-left corner is at (0,0) and the top-right corner is at (4,4). The shape is made up of filled squares at positions (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), and (3,2). Now, I need to figure out what happens when this shape is reflected across the vertical line x=2, which is right in the middle of the grid. \n\nFirst, I need to visualize the grid. It's a 5x5 grid, so the coordinates go from (0,0) to (4,4). Each position is a square on the grid. The shape we're dealing with is filled at four specific points: (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), and (3,2). Let me plot these points mentally. \n\nStarting at (1,1): that's one unit to the right and one unit up from the origin. Then (1,2): same x-coordinate, two units up. (2,1): two units right, one unit up. And (3,2): three units right, two units up. So, if I imagine this, it's like a sort of L-shape but with an extra point at (3,2). Hmm, maybe it's a combination of smaller shapes. \n\nNow, reflecting across the vertical line x=2. Reflection across a vertical line means that the x-coordinate of each point will be mirrored with respect to x=2. The formula for reflecting a point (x,y) across the line x=a is (2a - x, y). In this case, a is 2, so the reflection of (x,y) would be (4 - x, y). \n\nLet me test this formula with a point I know. If I take (1,1), reflecting it across x=2 should give me (4 - 1, 1) = (3,1). Similarly, (1,2) would reflect to (3,2). Let me check another point: (2,1). Reflecting that would be (4 - 2, 1) = (2,1). Wait, that's the same as the original point. Makes sense because x=2 is the axis of reflection, so points on the line of reflection stay the same. \n\nWhat about (3,2)? Reflecting that would give me (4 - 3, 2) = (1,2). So, the reflection of (3,2) is (1,2). Interesting, so the reflection swaps (1,1) with (3,1), (1,2) with (3,2), and leaves (2,1) unchanged. \n\nSo, the original shape has four points: (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (3,2). After reflection, these points will be transformed as follows:\n\n- (1,1) \u2192 (3,1)\n- (1,2) \u2192 (3,2)\n- (2,1) stays at (2,1)\n- (3,2) \u2192 (1,2)\n\nTherefore, the reflected shape should have the points (3,1), (3,2), (2,1), and (1,2). \n\nWait, let me double-check. If I reflect each original point correctly:\n\n- (1,1) becomes (3,1)\n- (1,2) becomes (3,2)\n- (2,1) stays\n- (3,2) becomes (1,2)\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the reflected shape has four points: (3,1), (3,2), (2,1), and (1,2). \n\nI should also visualize this. The original shape is on the left side of the grid, near the bottom and middle. After reflection, it should be on the right side, mirroring the original. So, (3,1) is on the right side, one unit up from the bottom, (3,2) is two units up, (2,1) is still in the center bottom, and (1,2) is on the left side, two units up. \n\nWait, (1,2) is actually on the left side, but after reflection, (3,2) is on the right. Hmm, but (1,2) is now on the left, but since we reflected across x=2, the left and right are swapped. So, (1,2) is actually on the right side after reflection. Wait, no, (1,2) is on the left, but after reflection, it's mirrored to (3,2). So, perhaps I got confused.\n\nLet me clarify: the reflection across x=2 maps the left side (x < 2) to the right side (x > 2) and vice versa. So, points originally on the left (x < 2) will be on the right after reflection, and points on the right will be on the left. \n\nSo, (1,1) is on the left, becomes (3,1) on the right. (1,2) is on the left, becomes (3,2) on the right. (2,1) is on the axis, stays. (3,2) is on the right, becomes (1,2) on the left.\n\nSo, the reflected shape has points on both the left and right sides, but their positions are mirrored. So, the filled squares after reflection are at (3,1), (3,2), (2,1), and (1,2). \n\nI think that's it. The reflection correctly mirrors each point across the vertical line x=2, resulting in the new set of points.\n</think>\n\nThe reflected shape will have filled squares at positions (1,2), (2,1), (3,1), and (3,2).\n\nDONE."

End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: A shape is placed on a 5\u00d75 grid, with the bottom-left corner of the grid being position (0,0) and the top-right corner being position (4,4). The shape consists of filled squares at positions (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), and (3,2). If this shape is reflected across the vertical line x=2 (which runs through the middle of the grid), what positions will be filled in the reflected shape? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this problem here about a shape on a 5x5 grid. The grid goes from (0,0) at the bottom-left to (4,4) at the top-right. The shape is made up of filled squares at positions (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), and (3,2). Now, I need to figure out what happens when this shape is reflected across the vertical line x=2. I'm a bit new to reflections in grids, so I need to take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I should probably visualize the grid. It's a 5x5 grid, so it has 5 rows and 5 columns, each labeled from 0 to 4. The vertical line x=2 is in the middle of the grid because the grid goes from x=0 to x=4, so halfway is at x=2. Reflecting across this line means that each point (x, y) will have a corresponding point on the other side of the line.\n\nI remember that reflecting a point across a vertical line involves changing the x-coordinate's sign relative to the line. Since the line is at x=2, any point to the left of the line (where x < 2) will be reflected to the right (x > 2), and vice versa. The y-coordinate remains the same because the reflection is only across a vertical line.\n\nSo, for each filled square in the original shape, I need to find its reflection across x=2. Let's list out the original coordinates again: (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), and (3,2).\n\nStarting with (1,1): Since x=1 is less than 2, its reflection will be at x=2 + (2 - 1) = 3. So, the reflected point is (3,1).\n\nNext, (1,2): x=1 is also less than 2, so reflecting it gives x=3. The y-coordinate remains 2. So, the reflected point is (3,2).\n\nMoving on to (2,1): x=2 is exactly on the line of reflection, so it should stay the same. Therefore, the reflected point is (2,1).\n\nLastly, (3,2): x=3 is greater than 2, so the reflection will be on the left side. The distance from x=3 to x=2 is 1, so the reflection will be at x=2 - 1 = 1. So, the reflected point is (1,2).\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I did that right. For (3,2), since it's to the right of x=2, I subtract the distance from 2. The distance from 3 to 2 is 1, so 2 - 1 = 1. So yes, (1,2). That makes sense.\n\nLet me list all the reflected points again to double-check:\n\n- (1,1) \u2192 (3,1)\n- (1,2) \u2192 (3,2)\n- (2,1) \u2192 (2,1)\n- (3,2) \u2192 (1,2)\n\nNow, I need to make sure that these reflected points are within the grid. The grid goes from x=0 to x=4, so all these points are valid.\n\nI also want to visualize where these points would be. The original shape is in the lower-left and middle parts of the grid. After reflection, it should appear on the upper-right and middle parts.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether any of these reflected points overlap with the original shape or not. The original points are at (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (3,2), and the reflected points are at (3,1), (3,2), (2,1), (1,2). So, (3,2) and (2,1) are common in both. That makes sense because x=2 is the reflection line, so points on the line remain unchanged.\n\nWait, does that mean the shape is symmetric around x=2? Let me check. If I look at the original points: (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (3,2). The reflected points are (3,1), (3,2), (2,1), (1,2). So, the points (2,1) and (3,2) are the same before and after reflection. The other points are mirrored across x=2. So yes, the shape is symmetric with respect to the vertical line x=2.\n\nI think that's it. Each original point has its reflection correctly calculated, and the overall shape maintains its structure after reflection across x=2.\n</think>\n\nThe reflected shape will have filled squares at positions (3,1), (3,2), (2,1), and (1,2).\n\nDONE."

The grid goes from (0,0) at the bottom-left to (4,4) at the top-right. The shape consists of filled squares at positions (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), and (3,2). Now, I need to figure out where these filled squares will end up after the shape is reflected across the vertical line x=2. \n\nFirst, I should probably visualize the grid and the original shape. Let me sketch a 5x5 grid in my mind. The vertical line x=2 is right in the middle, so it's at column 2 if we consider the grid starting at x=0. Reflecting across this line means that each point (x,y) will be mapped to (4 - x, y), because the distance from x=0 to x=4 is 4 units, so the reflection over x=2 would flip the x-coordinate across that midpoint.\n\nLet me list out the original filled squares and their coordinates:\n\n1. (1,1)\n2. (1,2)\n3. (2,1)\n4. (3,2)\n\nNow, I need to reflect each of these points across x=2. To do that, I'll use the reflection formula. For a vertical line x=a, the reflection of a point (x,y) is (2a - x, y). In this case, a=2, so the reflection of (x,y) will be (4 - x, y).\n\nLet me apply this to each point:\n\n1. Reflecting (1,1): 4 - 1 = 3, so the reflected point is (3,1).\n2. Reflecting (1,2): 4 - 1 = 3, so the reflected point is (3,2).\n3. Reflecting (2,1): 4 - 2 = 2, so the reflected point is (2,1).\n4. Reflecting (3,2): 4 - 3 = 1, so the reflected point is (1,2).\n\nWait a minute, that's interesting. After reflection, the points seem to swap places between certain coordinates. Let me double-check each reflection to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with (1,1): Yes, 4 - 1 is indeed 3, so (3,1) is correct.\n\n(1,2): 4 - 1 is 3, so (3,2) is correct.\n\n(2,1): 4 - 2 is 2, so (2,1) remains the same. That makes sense because it's on the line of reflection, so it maps to itself.\n\n(3,2): 4 - 3 is 1, so (1,2) is correct.\n\nHmm, so after reflection, the filled squares will be at (3,1), (3,2), (2,1), and (1,2). Wait, but I noticed that (1,2) was already one of the original points. So, is (1,2) now both original and reflected? No, actually, after reflection, (1,2) will be a new point, but in the original shape, (1,2) was already filled. So, does that mean that after reflection, the shape will include both the original and the reflected points?\n\nWait, no. The reflection is a transformation applied to the entire shape. So, the original shape has those four points, and after reflection, each of those points is moved to their reflected positions. So, the reflected shape will have the points (3,1), (3,2), (2,1), and (1,2).\n\nBut wait, in the original shape, (1,2) was already a filled square. So, does that mean that after reflection, (1,2) is still filled, and we also have (3,1), (3,2), and (2,1)? Or is it that the reflected shape only includes the images of the original points?\n\nI think it's the latter. The reflection operation moves each point to its mirrored position, so the reflected shape will consist of the images of the original points after reflection. Therefore, the reflected shape's filled squares are the reflections of the original ones, which are (3,1), (3,2), (2,1), and (1,2).\n\nBut let me make sure I'm not confusing the reflection of the entire shape with the reflection of individual points. The reflection across x=2 will flip the entire shape, so each point in the shape will be mirrored across that line. So, if the original shape has points at (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), and (3,2), the reflected shape will have points at (3,1), (3,2), (2,1), and (1,2), respectively.\n\nWait, but (2,1) is on the line of reflection, so it stays the same. So, in the reflected shape, (2,1) is still filled. Similarly, (3,2) reflects to (1,2), which was already filled in the original shape. So, does that mean that the reflected shape will have the same filled squares as the original? No, because the other points move.\n\nLet me list the original and reflected points again:\n\nOriginal: (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (3,2)\n\nReflected: (3,1), (3,2), (2,1), (1,2)\n\nSo, the reflected shape has (3,1), which wasn't in the original, and (1,2), which was in the original. So, the reflected shape has a new filled square at (3,1) and retains (1,2), (2,1), and (3,2). So, the filled squares after reflection are at (3,1), (1,2), (2,1), and (3,2).\n\nBut wait, in the original shape, (1,2) was already there, so after reflection, it's still there, but now (3,1) is added. So, the reflected shape's filled squares are (3,1), (1,2), (2,1), and (3,2).\n\nI think that's correct. To confirm, I can think about the positions. The original shape is in the lower-left and upper-middle part of the grid. After reflecting across x=2, it should be mirrored to the upper-right and lower-middle.\n\nSo, (1,1) reflects to (3,1), which is in the upper-right area. (1,2) reflects to (3,2), which is also in the upper-right. (2,1) stays at (2,1), which is on the middle-left. (3,2) reflects back to (1,2), which is in the lower-left.\n\nWait, but (1,2) was already in the original shape. So, after reflection, the shape includes both (1,2) and (3,2). That seems a bit odd because (3,2) was also in the original shape, but now it's mirrored to (1,2). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reflected shape will have all the mirrored points, regardless of whether they were originally there. So, the reflected shape will have (3,1), (3,2), (2,1), and (1,2), which includes both new and old points.\n\nI think that's the correct approach. The reflection operation doesn't remove any points; it just moves them. So, the reflected shape will have the same number of filled squares, but their positions will be mirrored.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\nOriginal points: (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (3,2)\n\nReflected points: (3,1), (3,2), (2,1), (1,2)\n\nTherefore, the reflected shape's filled squares are at (3,1), (3,2), (2,1), and (1,2).\n</think>\n\nThe reflected shape will have filled squares at positions (3,1), (3,2), (2,1), and (1,2).\n\nDONE."

The shape consists of filled squares at positions (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), and (3,2). If this shape is reflected across the vertical line x=2 (which runs through the middle of the grid), what positions will be filled in the reflected shape? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this problem where there's a 5x5 grid, with the bottom-left corner at (0,0) and the top-right corner at (4,4). There's a shape made up of filled squares at positions (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), and (3,2). I need to figure out what these positions will be after reflecting the shape across the vertical line x=2. Hmm, okay, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I should probably visualize the grid. It's a 5x5 grid, so it has 5 rows and 5 columns, right? The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom-left to (4,4) at the top-right. So, each square can be identified by its (x,y) position, where x is the column number and y is the row number.\n\nNow, the original shape has filled squares at (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), and (3,2). Let me plot these mentally:\n\n- (1,1): That's the square in the first column, second row from the bottom.\n- (1,2): First column, third row from the bottom.\n- (2,1): Second column, second row.\n- (3,2): Third column, third row.\n\nSo, it's like a little cluster in the lower-left part of the grid. Maybe like a 2x2 square missing one corner or something. Not sure, but okay.\n\nNow, the reflection is across the vertical line x=2. That line runs through the middle of the grid, so it's the line where x=2, which would split the grid into two halves: left of x=2 and right of x=2.\n\nReflection across a vertical line affects the x-coordinate. For any point (x,y), its reflection across x=2 would be (4 - x, y). Wait, let me think about that. If I have a point at x=1, reflecting it across x=2 would put it at x=3 because 2 - (1 - 2) = 3. Similarly, a point at x=3 would reflect to x=1, and x=2 stays at x=2 because it's on the line of reflection.\n\nSo, the reflection transformation is (x, y) \u2192 (4 - x, y). Got it.\n\nSo, to find the reflected positions, I can apply this transformation to each of the original filled squares.\n\nLet's do that step by step.\n\nOriginal filled squares:\n1. (1,1)\n2. (1,2)\n3. (2,1)\n4. (3,2)\n\nApplying reflection across x=2:\n\n1. (1,1) \u2192 (4 - 1, 1) = (3,1)\n2. (1,2) \u2192 (4 - 1, 2) = (3,2)\n3. (2,1) \u2192 (4 - 2, 1) = (2,1)\n4. (3,2) \u2192 (4 - 3, 2) = (1,2)\n\nSo, the reflected positions are (3,1), (3,2), (2,1), and (1,2).\n\nWait a minute, that's interesting. The reflected positions seem to mirror the original ones. So, the cluster that was on the left side of x=2 is now on the right side, but in the same relative positions.\n\nLet me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with (1,1): reflecting over x=2, the distance from x=1 to x=2 is 1 unit, so it should be the same distance on the other side, which is x=3. So, (3,1) is correct.\n\nSimilarly, (1,2) is 1 unit away from x=2, so it reflects to (3,2). Correct.\n\n(2,1): It's on the line of reflection, so it stays at (2,1). That makes sense.\n\n(3,2): It's 1 unit away from x=2 on the right side, so reflecting it would bring it 1 unit to the left, which is x=1. So, (1,2). Correct.\n\nSo, after reflection, the filled squares are at (3,1), (3,2), (2,1), and (1,2).\n\nWait, but let me think again about the reflection formula. Sometimes, reflections can be a bit confusing. The formula I used was (x, y) \u2192 (4 - x, y). Is that right?\n\nYes, because the grid is from x=0 to x=4. The vertical line is at x=2. So, for any point x, its reflection across x=2 would be at 2 + (2 - x) = 4 - x. So, yes, that formula is correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as the mirror image across the line x=2. The distance from x to 2 is |x - 2|, so the reflection would be at 2 + (2 - x) = 4 - x. Yep, that checks out.\n\nSo, the reflected positions are indeed (3,1), (3,2), (2,1), and (1,2).\n\nLet me visualize this. The original shape was on the left side, and after reflection, it's on the right side but mirrored. So, the cluster that was near the bottom-left is now near the bottom-right, but same structure.\n\nI think that's it. So, the filled squares after reflection are at those four positions.\n</think>\n\nThe reflected shape across the vertical line x=2 will have filled squares at positions (3,1), (3,2), (2,1), and (1,2).\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\n(3,1), (3,2), (2,1), and (1,2).\n\nDONE."

If this shape is reflected across the vertical line x=2 (which runs through the middle of the grid), what positions will be filled in the reflected shape? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this problem here about a shape on a 5x5 grid. The grid's bottom-left corner is at (0,0) and the top-right is at (4,4). The shape is made up of filled squares at positions (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), and (3,2). Now, I need to figure out where these squares will end up after reflecting the shape across the vertical line x=2. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should probably visualize the grid. It's a 5x5 grid, so the coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom-left to (4,4) at the top-right. The vertical line x=2 runs right through the middle of the grid, so it's like a mirror line dividing the grid into two halves. Reflecting a shape across this line means that each point on one side of the line will have a corresponding mirrored point on the other side.\n\nThe original shape has four filled squares at specific points. Let me list them out again:\n\n1. (1,1)\n2. (1,2)\n3. (2,1)\n4. (3,2)\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to reflect each of these points across the vertical line x=2 individually and then see where they end up. But wait, before I do that, maybe I should recall how reflections work in coordinate geometry.\n\nWhen you reflect a point across a vertical line, the x-coordinate changes, but the y-coordinate stays the same. The formula for reflecting a point (x,y) across the line x=a is (2a - x, y). In this case, a is 2 because the line is x=2. So, applying this formula to each point should give me their reflected positions.\n\nLet me apply this formula to each of the four points:\n\n1. For (1,1):\n   - x = 1, y = 1\n   - Reflected x = 2*2 - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3\n   - So the reflected point is (3,1)\n\n2. For (1,2):\n   - x = 1, y = 2\n   - Reflected x = 2*2 - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3\n   - Reflected point is (3,2)\n\n3. For (2,1):\n   - x = 2, y = 1\n   - Reflected x = 2*2 - 2 = 4 - 2 = 2\n   - Reflected point is (2,1)\n\n4. For (3,2):\n   - x = 3, y = 2\n   - Reflected x = 2*2 - 3 = 4 - 3 = 1\n   - Reflected point is (1,2)\n\nWait a minute, let me make sure I did that correctly. So, reflecting across x=2, each x-coordinate is mirrored around 2. So, for any point, its distance from 2 on the left is the same as on the right. So, for example, (1,1) is 1 unit to the left of x=2, so it should be mirrored 1 unit to the right, which would be x=3, keeping y the same. Similarly, (3,2) is 1 unit to the right of x=2, so it mirrors to x=1, keeping y the same. For points exactly on x=2, they stay the same.\n\nLooking back at my calculations, I think they're correct. So, the reflected points are:\n\n- (1,1) becomes (3,1)\n- (1,2) becomes (3,2)\n- (2,1) stays at (2,1)\n- (3,2) becomes (1,2)\n\nSo, the reflected shape will have filled squares at (3,1), (3,2), (2,1), and (1,2). But wait, let me check if there are any overlaps or if I missed any points.\n\nWait, the original shape has (2,1) and the reflected shape also has (2,1). That makes sense because it's on the line of reflection, so it remains the same. The other points swap places: (1,1) and (3,1), (1,2) and (3,2).\n\nLet me just visualize this. The original shape is on the left side of x=2, and after reflection, it should be on the right side, with the same positions relative to x=2. So, yes, that seems right.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes in the reflection formula. Each x-coordinate is transformed as 2*2 - x, so for x=1, it's 3; for x=3, it's 1; and for x=2, it's 2. Y-coordinates remain the same, so the y's are all 1 and 2 in the original, and the same in the reflected.\n\nTherefore, the reflected shape has filled squares at (3,1), (3,2), (2,1), and (1,2). So, that should be the answer.\n\nWait, just to double-check, let's list the original and reflected points side by side:\n\nOriginal:\n- (1,1)\n- (1,2)\n- (2,1)\n- (3,2)\n\nReflected:\n- (3,1)\n- (3,2)\n- (2,1)\n- (1,2)\n\nYes, that looks consistent. Each point from the original has a mirror image on the other side of x=2, except for the one on the line itself, which stays put.\n\nI think that's all. So, the reflected shape's filled positions are (3,1), (3,2), (2,1), and (1,2).\n</think>\n\nThe reflected shape across the vertical line x=2 will have filled squares at positions (3,1), (3,2), (2,1), and (1,2).\n\nDONE."

I need to figure out where these squares will end up after the shape is reflected across the vertical line x=2. \n\nFirst, let me visualize the grid. It's a 5x5 grid, so it's like a square with 5 points along each side. The vertical line x=2 is in the middle of the grid, right? Because the grid goes from x=0 to x=4, so halfway is at x=2.

If the line is at x=2, then the distance from x to 2 is the same as the distance from 4 - x to 2. So yes, reflecting a point (x, y) across x=2 would result in the point (4 - x, y).\n\nLet me test this with an example. If I have a point at (1,1), reflecting it across x=2 should give me (3,1). Because 4 - 1 is 3. Similarly, a point at (2,1) is on the line x=2, so it stays the same. A point at (3,2) would reflect to (1,2), and (1,2) would reflect to (3,2). \n\nWait, so the original shape has points at (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), and (3,2). After reflection, each of these points will be mirrored across x=2. So:\n\n- (1,1) becomes (3,1)\n- (1,2) becomes (3,2)\n- (2,1) remains (2,1)\n- (3,2) becomes (1,2)\n\nSo the reflected shape will have points at (3,1), (3,2), (2,1), and (1,2). Let me make sure I got that right. Each x-coordinate is mirrored around 2, and the y-coordinate stays the same.\n\nLet me double-check the reflection formula. If the mirror is at x=2, then the reflection of a point (x, y) is indeed (4 - x, y). For example, (0,0) reflects to (4,0), and (4,4) reflects to (0,4). So yes, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, after reflection, the filled squares will be at (1,2), (2,1), (3,1), and (3,2). Wait, no, hold on. Let me list them again:\n\nOriginal points:\n- (1,1) \u2192 (3,1)\n- (1,2) \u2192 (3,2)\n- (2,1) stays\n- (3,2) \u2192 (1,2)\n\nSo the reflected points are (3,1), (3,2), (2,1), and (1,2). So the shape after reflection will have filled squares at these four positions.\n\nI think that's it. Each original point has been correctly mirrored across x=2, and the y-coordinates remain unchanged.\n</think>\n\nThe reflected shape will have filled squares at positions (1,2), (2,1), (3,1), and (3,2).\n\n**Answer:** The reflected shape will have filled squares at positions \\boxed{(1,2)}, \\boxed{(2,1)}, \\boxed{(3,1)}, and \\boxed{(3,2)}.\n\nDONE."

    "solution": "Solve this problem step by step. End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: A shape is placed on a 5\u00d75 grid, with the bottom-left corner of the grid being position (0,0) and the top-right corner being position (4,4). The shape consists of filled squares at positions (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), and (3,2). If this shape is reflected across the vertical line x=2 (which runs through the middle of the grid), what positions will be filled in the reflected shape? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this problem here about a shape on a 5x5 grid. The grid goes from (0,0) at the bottom-left to (4,4) at the top-right. The shape is made up of filled squares at positions (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), and (3,2). Now, I need to figure out what the shape looks like after it's reflected across the vertical line x=2. \n\nFirst, I should probably visualize the grid. Since it's a 5x5 grid, each side has 5 units, but the coordinates go from 0 to 4. So, the vertical line x=2 is right in the middle of the grid, splitting it into two halves. Reflecting across this line means that each point (x,y) will have a mirror image on the other side of the line. \n\nI remember that reflecting a point across a vertical line involves changing the x-coordinate. The formula for reflection across a vertical line x=a is (2a - x, y). In this case, a is 2, so the reflection of a point (x,y) would be (4 - x, y). \n\nLet me apply this to each of the original points:\n\n1. Starting with (1,1):\n   - Reflecting x=1 across x=2: 2*2 - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3. So, the reflected point is (3,1).\n\n2. Next, (1,2):\n   - Reflecting x=1: 4 - 1 = 3. So, the reflected point is (3,2).\n\n3. Then, (2,1):\n   - Reflecting x=2: 4 - 2 = 2. So, the reflected point is (2,1). Wait, that's the same as the original point. That makes sense because x=2 is the line of reflection, so it stays the same.\n\n4. Lastly, (3,2):\n   - Reflecting x=3: 4 - 3 = 1. So, the reflected point is (1,2).\n\nPutting it all together, the reflected shape will have filled squares at (3,1), (3,2), (2,1), and (1,2). \n\nLet me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. For each point, I applied the reflection formula correctly. (1,1) becomes (3,1), (1,2) becomes (3,2), (2,1) stays as (2,1), and (3,2) becomes (1,2). Yep, that looks right.\n\nSo, the reflected shape has the same number of filled squares, just mirrored across the vertical line in the middle of the grid.\n</think>\n\nThe reflected shape will have filled squares at positions (1,2), (2,1), (3,1), and (3,2). \n\nDONE."
