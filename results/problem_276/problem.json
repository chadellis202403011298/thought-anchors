  "question": "A small town has three autonomous delivery robots (A, B, and C) that deliver packages to residents. Each robot can carry up to 5 packages at once and operates independently. The robots need to deliver a total of 12 packages to different locations around town, with each package having a specific destination. The town council wants to minimize the total distance traveled by all robots.\n\nIf the town can be represented as a simple grid where:\n- Robot A starts at position (0,0)\n- Robot B starts at position (10,0)\n- Robot C starts at position (5,5)\n\nAnd the 12 packages need to be delivered to these coordinates:\n1. (1,2)\n2. (3,4)\n3. (8,2)\n4. (9,3)\n5. (2,7)\n6. (4,8)\n7. (7,6)\n8. (6,1)\n9. (2,3)\n10. (4,2)\n11. (8,7)\n12. (5,2)\n\nWhich robot should deliver which packages to minimize the total distance traveled? Assume that each robot returns to its starting position after completing all deliveries, and that the distance is calculated using Manhattan distance (|x\u2081-x\u2082| + |y\u2081-y\u2082|).",
  "answer": "To solve this problem, I need to determine which robot should deliver which packages to minimize the total distance traveled.\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the Manhattan distance from each robot's starting position to each package location, and then from each package location back to the robot's starting position.\n\nRobot A starts at (0,0):\n- Package 1 at (1,2): |0-1| + |0-2| = 3\n- Package 2 at (3,4): |0-3| + |0-4| = 7\n- Package 3 at (8,2): |0-8| + |0-2| = 10\n- Package 4 at (9,3): |0-9| + |0-3| = 12\n- Package 5 at (2,7): |0-2| + |0-7| = 9\n- Package 6 at (4,8): |0-4| + |0-8| = 12\n- Package 7 at (7,6): |0-7| + |0-6| = 13\n- Package 8 at (6,1): |0-6| + |0-1| = 7\n- Package 9 at (2,3): |0-2| + |0-3| = 5\n- Package 10 at (4,2): |0-4| + |0-2| = 6\n- Package 11 at (8,7): |0-8| + |0-7| = 15\n- Package 12 at (5,2): |0-5| + |0-2| = 7\n\nRobot B starts at (10,0):\n- Package 1 at (1,2): |10-1| + |0-2| = 11\n- Package 2 at (3,4): |10-3| + |0-4| = 11\n- Package 3 at (8,2): |10-8| + |0-2| = 4\n- Package 4 at (9,3): |10-9| + |0-3| = 4\n- Package 5 at (2,7): |10-2| + |0-7| = 15\n- Package 6 at (4,8): |10-4| + |0-8| = 14\n- Package 7 at (7,6): |10-7| + |0-6| = 9\n- Package 8 at (6,1): |10-6| + |0-1| = 5\n- Package 9 at (2,3): |10-2| + |0-3| = 11\n- Package 10 at (4,2): |10-4| + |0-2| = 8\n- Package 11 at (8,7): |10-8| + |0-7| = 9\n- Package 12 at (5,2): |10-5| + |0-2| = 7\n\nRobot C starts at (5,5):\n- Package 1 at (1,2): |5-1| + |5-2| = 7\n- Package 2 at (3,4): |5-3| + |5-4| = 3\n- Package 3 at (8,2): |5-8| + |5-2| = 6\n- Package 4 at (9,3): |5-9| + |5-3| = 6\n- Package 5 at (2,7): |5-2| + |5-7| = 5\n- Package 6 at (4,8): |5-4| + |5-8| = 4\n- Package 7 at (7,6): |5-7| + |5-6| = 3\n- Package 8 at (6,1): |5-6| + |5-1| = 5\n- Package 9 at (2,3): |5-2| + |5-3| = 5\n- Package 10 at (4,2): |5-4| + |5-2| = 4\n- Package 11 at (8,7): |5-8| + |5-7| = 5\n- Package 12 at (5,2): |5-5| + |5-2| = 3\n\nNext, I need to assign packages to robots to minimize total distance while respecting the constraint that each robot can carry at most 5 packages.\n\nLooking at which robot has the shortest distance to each package:\n- Package 1: Robot A (3)\n- Package 2: Robot C (3)\n- Package 3: Robot B (4)\n- Package 4: Robot B (4)\n- Package 5: Robot C (5)\n- Package 6: Robot C (4)\n- Package 7: Robot C (3)\n- Package 8: Robot B (5)\n- Package 9: Robot A (5)\n- Package 10: Robot C (4)\n- Package 11: Robot C/B tie (both 9, but we'll give to B since C is getting many packages)\n- Package 12: Robot C (3)\n\nBased on these distances and the constraint of 5 packages per robot:\n\nRobot A should deliver: Packages 1, 9, 10 (shortest distances)\nRobot B should deliver: Packages 3, 4, 8, 11 (shortest distances)\nRobot C should deliver: Packages 2, 5, 6, 7, 12 (shortest distances)\n\nThis assignment respects the 5-package limit per robot and generally assigns packages to the robot with the shortest distance to that package.\n\nTotal distance for Robot A: 3 + 5 + 6 + return to start = 14 + return distances\nTotal distance for Robot B: 4 + 4 + 5 + 9 + return to start = 22 + return distances\nTotal distance for Robot C: 3 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 3 + return to start = 18 + return distances\n\nThis distribution minimizes the total distance traveled by all robots while respecting the carrying capacity constraint."
