  "question": "You have five towns (A, B, C, D, and E) that need to be connected by roads. Due to the geography of the region, each town can only be connected directly to at most three other towns. Is it possible to construct roads such that a person can travel from any town to any other town (directly or indirectly), while using exactly 7 roads in total? If so, provide one possible arrangement of the roads.",
  "answer": "Step 1: Let's determine the minimum number of roads needed to connect all five towns. For any connected network, the minimum number of connections (roads) needed is (number of towns - 1). So with 5 towns, we need at least 4 roads to ensure all towns are connected.\n\nStep 2: We need to use exactly 7 roads, which is more than the minimum required. This means our network will have some redundancy or cycles.\n\nStep 3: Each town can connect to at most 3 other towns, which means each town can have at most 3 roads coming out of it.\n\nStep 4: Let's construct a possible solution. One way to arrange the roads is:\n- Road 1: A to B\n- Road 2: B to C\n- Road 3: C to D\n- Road 4: D to E\n- Road 5: E to A (creates a cycle A-B-C-D-E-A)\n- Road 6: A to C (creates another path between A and C)\n- Road 7: B to D (creates another path between B and D)\n\nStep 5: Let's verify this solution:\n- Town A has 3 connections (to B, C, and E)\n- Town B has 3 connections (to A, C, and D)\n- Town C has 3 connections (to A, B, and D)\n- Town D has 3 connections (to B, C, and E)\n- Town E has 2 connections (to A and D)\n\nStep 6: Check that all towns are connected: From any town, you can reach any other town by following a sequence of roads. For example, to go from A to D, you could take the direct path A-C-D or the path A-B-D.\n\nTherefore, yes, it is possible to construct a network with exactly 7 roads where all towns are connected and no town has more than 3 connections."
