Every morning, he takes the elevator down to the ground floor to go to work. In the evening, when he returns from work, he takes the elevator to the 7th floor and then walks up the stairs for the remaining three floors to his apartment. However, on rainy days, he takes the elevator all the way to the 10th floor. Why does he do this? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out why this man takes the elevator down to the ground floor every morning and then, except on rainy days, takes the elevator up to the 7th floor and walks up three more floors. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, he lives on the 10th floor. Every morning, he takes the elevator down to the ground floor, which is the 1st floor. That makes sense because he's going to work, so he needs to get all the way down. But in the evening, when he comes back, he takes the elevator only to the 7th floor and then walks up three floors. Hmm, why not take the elevator all the way up? Maybe because the elevator isn't running or he doesn't want to wait for it. But then on rainy days, he takes the elevator all the way to the 10th floor. So, what's different on rainy days?\n\nLet me think about elevators in apartment buildings. Elevators usually have certain hours or maybe they don't run all day. If it's raining, maybe the elevator isn't functioning properly, or perhaps he prefers not to get wet. Wait, but he still uses the elevator on rainy days. So, maybe the elevator isn't working on rainy days, but that doesn't make sense because he uses it then. Alternatively, maybe the elevator is out of order, but he still uses it, so that's not it.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the building has a rule about elevator usage, especially on rainy days. Maybe the elevator is only available during certain times, or it's reserved for certain purposes. For example, maybe during the day, the elevator is for deliveries or maintenance, so he can't use it in the morning. But in the evening, he can use it, except on rainy days when maybe it's not running or he prefers not to take it because it's slow or unreliable.\n\nWait, but on rainy days, he takes the elevator all the way up, so maybe the elevator is more reliable in the evening, but not in the morning. Or perhaps the elevator is only available in the evening, so he can't use it in the morning. But that doesn't fit because he does take the elevator down every morning.\n\nWait, maybe the building has a policy that the elevator is only for emergencies or during certain times, so he can't use it in the morning. But he does use it every morning, so that can't be it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the elevator is out of order in the morning, but he still uses it, so that's not it. Maybe the man works at a place that's on a lower floor, but he takes the elevator down every morning regardless.\n\nWait, perhaps the building has a rule that the elevator isn't to be used for commuting, so he walks down in the morning, but that's not the case because he takes the elevator.\n\nI'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think differently. He takes the elevator down every morning, so maybe he doesn't like walking down 10 floors. But in the evening, he takes the elevator up to 7th floor and walks up three. On rainy days, he takes the elevator all the way up. So, why the difference?\n\nMaybe on rainy days, the elevator is more convenient, perhaps because it's faster or he doesn't want to get wet. But he still uses the elevator in the evening normally. So, perhaps the building has a rule that the elevator is only to be used during certain times, like in the evening, but not in the morning. But he does use it in the morning.\n\nWait, perhaps the man is in a hurry in the morning and doesn't want to wait for the elevator, so he takes it down quickly, but in the evening, he can take it up to 7th floor and then walk up because it's only three floors. But on rainy days, he takes the elevator all the way because it's quicker or he doesn't want to get wet walking up three floors.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the elevator is only available in the evening, so he can't use it in the morning. But he does use it in the morning, so that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the building has a policy that the elevator is only for emergencies, like if someone is stuck, so he can't use it for commuting. But he does use it, so that's not it.\n\nI'm not getting it. Let me try to think of possible reasons why he would take the elevator down every morning but take it up only to 7th floor in the evening, except on rainy days when he takes it all the way.\n\nPerhaps the building's elevator is only operational in the evening, so he can't use it in the morning. But he does use it in the morning, so that can't be it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe he works on the 7th floor, but that doesn't make sense because he takes the elevator down to the ground floor every morning.\n\nWait, maybe the man works at the ground floor, so he needs to go all the way down in the morning. But in the evening, he just needs to go up to the 7th floor, so he takes the elevator up to 7 and walks up three. But on rainy days, maybe he prefers not to walk, so he takes the elevator all the way.\n\nBut why would he take the elevator up to 7th floor on normal days? Maybe because it's faster than walking up three floors, but on rainy days, he doesn't want to get wet, so he takes the elevator all the way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the elevator is only available in the evening, so he can't use it in the morning, but he does, so that's not it.\n\nWait, perhaps the building has a rule that the elevator is only for residents, and he's a resident, so he can use it. But that doesn't explain the difference between normal days and rainy days.\n\nI'm still stuck. Let me try to think of other possibilities. Maybe the man has a preference for the elevator's speed or reliability in the morning versus the evening. Maybe the elevator is slower in the morning, so he takes it down quickly, but in the evening, it's faster, so he takes it up to 7th floor. But on rainy days, maybe the elevator is more reliable, so he takes it all the way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the man has a physical limitation, like he can't walk up three floors easily, so on rainy days, he takes the elevator all the way, but on normal days, he can manage the walk, so he takes the elevator up to 7th floor.\n\nBut the problem doesn't mention any physical limitations.\n\nWait, perhaps the building's elevator has a maximum floor it can reach, so on rainy days, he can take it all the way up, but normally, it stops at 7th floor. So, maybe the elevator can only go up to 7th floor, but on rainy days, it can go all the way. But that's a stretch.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the man is in a hurry in the morning and doesn't want to wait for the elevator, so he just takes it down quickly, but in the evening, he's not in a rush, so he takes it up to 7th floor. On rainy days, maybe he's in a hurry and takes the elevator all the way.\n\nBut that doesn't fully explain it.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to think of the most straightforward reason. He takes the elevator down every morning because he needs to get to work quickly. In the evening, he takes the elevator up to 7th floor and walks up three floors because maybe the elevator isn't running or he doesn't want to take it all the way. But on rainy days, he takes the elevator all the way, perhaps because the elevator is more convenient or he doesn't want to get wet walking.\n\nWait, but the problem says he takes the elevator to the 7th floor and then walks up three floors on normal days, and on rainy days, he takes the elevator all the way. So, the only difference is that on rainy days, he uses the elevator fully, while on normal days, he takes it partway.\n\nMaybe the building has a policy that the elevator is only to be used for emergencies or specific purposes, so he can't use it to go up in the evening on normal days, but on rainy days, he's allowed to use it all the way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the man is in a hurry in the morning and doesn't want to wait for the elevator to go all the way down, but in the evening, he can take it up to 7th floor without waiting, so he does that. On rainy days, maybe the elevator is slower or he prefers not to walk, so he takes it all the way.\n\nI think the key is that on rainy days, he prefers not to walk up three floors, so he takes the elevator all the way. On normal days, he takes the elevator up to 7th floor and walks up because maybe the elevator isn't running or he doesn't want to wait for it.\n\nBut the problem is, why wouldn't he take the elevator all the way on normal days? Maybe because the elevator is only available in the evening or only for certain purposes, so he can't use it to go all the way up on normal days.\n\nWait, maybe the building has a rule that the elevator is only for emergencies, like if someone is stuck, so he can't use it for commuting. But he does use it, so that can't be it.\n\nI'm not getting it. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the man works on the ground floor, so he needs to take the elevator down every morning. In the evening, he just needs to go up to 7th floor, so he takes the elevator up to there and walks up three floors. On rainy days, he takes the elevator all the way because he doesn't want to get wet walking up three floors.\n\nSo, the reason is that on rainy days, he doesn't want to walk up three floors, so he takes the elevator all the way. On normal days, he takes the elevator up to 7th floor and walks up because maybe the elevator isn't running or he doesn't want to take it all the way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the elevator is only available in the evening, so he can't use it in the morning, but he does, so that's not it.\n\nWait, maybe the man doesn't mind walking up three floors on normal days, but on rainy days, he prefers not to get wet, so he takes the elevator all the way.\n\nI think that's the most plausible explanation. So, the man takes the elevator down every morning because he needs to get to work quickly. In the evening, he takes the elevator up to 7th floor and walks up the remaining three floors because it's only three floors, which isn't too bad. But on rainy days, he doesn't want to get wet walking up, so he takes the elevator all the way to the 10th floor.\n\nSo, the reason is that on rainy days, he prefers not to walk up the three floors, so he takes the elevator all the way. On normal days, he takes the elevator up to 7th floor and walks up because he doesn't mind the walk or the elevator isn't running.\n\nWait, but why wouldn't he take the elevator all the way on normal days? Maybe because the elevator is only available in the evening or for specific purposes, so he can't use it to go all the way up on normal days.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the man has a routine where he takes the elevator up to 7th floor and walks up because that's his usual route, but on rainy days, he deviates and takes the elevator all the way.\n\nI think the main reason is that on rainy days, he doesn't want to walk up three floors, so he takes the elevator all the way. On normal days, he takes the elevator partway and walks up because he doesn't mind the walk or the elevator isn't available to go all the way.\n\nSo, the answer is that on rainy days, he takes the elevator all the way to avoid getting wet walking up three floors, whereas on normal days, he takes the elevator up to 7th floor and walks up because he doesn't mind the walk or the elevator isn't running.\n\nWait, but the problem says he takes the elevator to the 7th floor and walks up three floors on normal days, and on rainy days, he takes the elevator all the way. So, the reason is that on rainy days, he doesn't want to walk, so he takes the elevator all the way.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nHe takes the elevator all the way to the 10th floor on rainy days to avoid getting wet while walking up the stairs. On normal days, he takes the elevator to the 7th floor and walks up the remaining three floors because he prefers to walk on those days or the elevator isn't running.\n\nDONE."

But on rainy days, he takes the elevator all the way to the 10th floor instead. Hmm, that's a bit puzzling. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, let's think about his daily routine. He lives on the 10th floor, which is pretty high up. Every morning, he takes the elevator down to the ground floor, which is the 1st floor, to go to work. So, that's a long way down. In the evening, when he comes back from work, he takes the elevator up to the 7th floor and then walks up three floors to his apartment. Wait, why wouldn't he just take the elevator all the way up to the 10th floor in the evening too? Maybe there's something about the elevator's behavior that I'm missing.\n\nOh, but on rainy days, he changes his routine. Instead of taking the elevator to the 7th floor, he takes it all the way to the 10th floor. So, the difference is whether it's raining or not. That must be the key here.\n\nLet me consider the possible reasons. Maybe the elevator has different behaviors based on the weather. On rainy days, maybe the elevator is slower, or perhaps it's not working properly. If the elevator is slow, taking it all the way up might save him time compared to walking up the stairs. But why would he walk up the stairs on dry days?\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the elevator has a limit on how high it can go. If it's raining, the elevator might not go beyond a certain floor, like the 7th, but on dry days, it can go all the way up. So, when it's raining, he can't take the elevator past the 7th floor, which is why he has to walk up the stairs on dry days. But that doesn't quite add up because on rainy days, he takes the elevator all the way to the 10th floor, which suggests that the elevator can go higher when it's raining.\n\nWait, maybe the elevator's speed changes with the weather. On dry days, it's faster, so he can get to the 7th floor quickly and then walk up the stairs. But on rainy days, the elevator is slower, so it takes him longer to reach the 7th floor, but he doesn't have to walk up the stairs because he takes the elevator all the way to the 10th floor. But that doesn't explain why on rainy days he doesn't just take the elevator to the 7th floor and then walk up, like he does on dry days. Maybe the elevator is more reliable on rainy days, so he can take it all the way up without worrying about it breaking down.\n\nOr perhaps the elevator has a malfunction when it's raining, and it can't go beyond the 7th floor unless it's raining. So, on dry days, he can take the elevator to the 10th floor normally, but on rainy days, the elevator stops at the 7th floor, so he has to walk up. But that contradicts the problem because on rainy days, he takes the elevator all the way to the 10th floor.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think about why he doesn't just take the elevator all the way up in the evening. Maybe the elevator is out of order, or perhaps it's too slow, so he prefers walking the stairs instead. But then why does he take the elevator on rainy days? Maybe the elevator is more reliable on rainy days, so he can take it all the way up without worrying about it breaking down or being slow.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the building's elevator has a feature where it stops at certain floors based on the weather. On rainy days, it stops at the 7th floor, so he can take it there and walk up. But why would it stop at the 7th floor only on rainy days? Maybe the elevator's destination is set by the weather, so on dry days, it goes all the way up, but on rainy days, it only goes to the 7th floor. That could be why he takes the elevator to the 7th floor on dry days and then walks up, but on rainy days, he takes it all the way to the 10th floor.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, perhaps the elevator's programming or mechanical system changes based on the weather. On dry days, it's set to go all the way up, so he can take it to the 10th floor. On rainy days, maybe the elevator is programmed to stop at the 7th floor, so he can take it there and then walk up. But that doesn't fully explain why he doesn't take the elevator all the way to the 10th floor on rainy days. Maybe the elevator on rainy days can't go beyond the 7th floor because of some mechanical issue, so he has to walk up the stairs. But the problem states that on rainy days, he takes the elevator all the way to the 10th floor, which suggests that the elevator can go higher when it's raining.\n\nI'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the elevator's speed is a factor. On dry days, it's faster, so he can get to the 7th floor quickly and then walk up. On rainy days, the elevator is slower, so it takes longer to reach the 7th floor, but he doesn't want to walk up the stairs in the rain, so he takes the elevator all the way to the 10th floor instead. That could make sense because walking up three floors in the rain might be inconvenient, so he chooses to take the elevator even if it's slower.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the elevator has a malfunction where it only goes to the 7th floor on dry days, but on rainy days, it can go all the way to the 10th floor. So, when it's raining, he doesn't have to worry about the elevator stopping at the 7th floor and then having to walk up, because it can take him all the way. That would explain his behavior.\n\nWait, that seems plausible. So, the building's elevator system changes its operation based on the weather. On dry days, it's set to stop at the 7th floor, so he takes it there and walks up. On rainy days, the elevator is adjusted to go all the way up to the 10th floor, so he can avoid walking in the rain.\n\nAnother possibility is that the elevator's maintenance or safety features are affected by the weather. For example, on rainy days, the elevator might have a system to prevent it from going too high due to water pressure or something, but that's a bit far-fetched.\n\nI think the most likely explanation is that the elevator's operation changes with the weather. On dry days, it stops at the 7th floor, so he takes it there and walks up. On rainy days, the elevator can go all the way to the 10th floor, so he takes it there instead of walking in the rain.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the man takes the elevator to the 7th floor on dry days because the elevator stops there, and then he walks up the remaining three floors. But on rainy days, the elevator can go higher, so he takes it all the way to the 10th floor to avoid walking in the rain.\n</think>\n\nThe man takes the elevator to the 7th floor on dry days because the elevator stops there, and he walks up the remaining three floors. On rainy days, the elevator can go all the way to the 10th floor, so he takes it there to avoid walking in the rain.\n\nDONE."

Every morning, he takes the elevator down to the ground floor (which is the 1st floor) to go to work. That makes sense because taking the elevator down is faster than walking down 10 floors, especially if the building is tall.\n\nIn the evening, when he returns from work, he takes the elevator up to the 7th floor and then walks up the remaining three floors to his apartment. So, why doesn't he just take the elevator all the way to the 10th floor every evening? Well, maybe it's about the effort or time. Taking the elevator up only to the 7th floor and then walking up three floors might be easier or quicker than going all the way up to 10.\n\nBut then, on rainy days, he takes the elevator all the way to the 10th floor. So, why the change on rainy days? Maybe because on rainy days, he doesn't want to get his clothes wet by walking up the stairs. Walking three floors in the rain could mean getting wet, which he avoids by taking the elevator all the way up.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's something about the elevator itself. Maybe on rainy days, the elevator is faster or more reliable, so he prefers it. Or maybe the elevator is out of service, but that doesn't make sense because he uses it every morning and evening. Wait, no, the problem says he takes the elevator every morning and evening except on rainy days when he takes it all the way up.\n\nWait, maybe it's about the time. If he takes the elevator up to the 7th floor, he can walk up three floors, which might take less time than waiting for the elevator to go all the way up. But on rainy days, he might prefer the convenience of the elevator to avoid getting wet.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the building has a policy or rule about using the elevator. For example, perhaps after a certain time, the elevator only goes up to the 7th floor, so he has to walk up the rest. But that might not explain why he takes the elevator all the way on rainy days.\n\nWait, perhaps the man works in an area where it's raining in the evenings, so he prefers not to be outside in the rain. So, he takes the elevator all the way up to his apartment to avoid getting wet. That makes sense because if it's raining, he doesn't want to be walking up the stairs, which are probably outside or exposed.\n\nSo, putting it all together, during normal days, he takes the elevator down in the morning and up to the 7th floor in the evening, then walks up three floors because it's quicker or he doesn't mind the walk.

However, on rainy days, he takes the elevator all the way to the 10th floor. Why does he do this? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I've come across this interesting puzzle about a man living on the 10th floor of an apartment building. Every morning, he takes the elevator down to the ground floor to go to work. In the evening, after returning from work, he takes the elevator up to the 7th floor and then walks up the remaining three floors to his apartment. But here's the twist: on rainy days, he takes the elevator all the way to the 10th floor. The question is, why does he do this?\n\nAt first glance, this seems a bit puzzling. Why would he change his routine on rainy days? Is there something about the weather that affects his elevator usage? Maybe it's about efficiency or perhaps a hidden benefit on rainy days.\n\nLet me break this down. Normally, in the morning, he goes from the 10th floor to the ground floor (which we can assume is the 1st floor). So, he takes the elevator down 9 floors. In the evening, he goes from the ground floor back up to the 7th floor, which is a rise of 7 floors, and then walks up 3 floors from the 7th to the 10th. So, on a typical day, his elevator usage is 9 floors down and 7 floors up, plus 3 floors by walking.\n\nBut on rainy days, he takes the elevator all the way to the 10th floor. That means in the evening, instead of getting off at the 7th floor and walking up, he stays in the elevator until he reaches his apartment. So, on rainy days, he goes from the ground floor up to the 10th floor, which is 10 floors up.\n\nI'm trying to figure out why this difference exists. Maybe it's about something else the elevator does on rainy days. Wait, perhaps the elevator's behavior changes on rainy days. Maybe the elevator doesn't stop at certain floors when it's raining, or perhaps there's a limitation in the elevator's operation during bad weather.\n\nAnother angle to consider is the man's routine and how it's affected by the weather. Maybe on rainy days, he doesn't want to get wet, so he avoids walking the three floors. But that doesn't quite make sense because he's taking the elevator all the way up, so he wouldn't have to walk at all. Wait, no, on rainy days, he's taking the elevator to the 10th floor, so he's not walking at all in the evening. On normal days, he walks up 3 floors. So why would he prefer taking the elevator all the way on rainy days? Maybe it's more about the elevator's operation.\n\nPerhaps the elevator has a rule that it doesn't stop at certain floors when it's raining. Maybe on rainy days, the elevator only stops at the ground floor and the top floor, or maybe it's out of service for certain floors during rain. So, if he takes the elevator on a rainy evening, he can't get off at the 7th floor because the elevator isn't stopping there when it's raining. Therefore, he has to take it all the way to the 10th floor.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the man's apartment is on the 10th floor, and the elevator on rainy days only goes to the 10th floor. So, if he takes the elevator in the evening, he can't get off at the 7th floor because the elevator isn't making stops in between during rain. Therefore, he has to take it all the way up.\n\nAnother possibility is that on rainy days, the elevator is malfunctioning or has a limitation. For example, maybe the elevator can only go up to the 10th floor on rainy days, so he can't get off at the 7th floor. That would force him to take the elevator all the way up.\n\nI'm also considering the possibility that the man's apartment is on the 10th floor, and the elevator on rainy days only goes to the 10th floor. So, if he takes the elevator in the evening, he can't get off at the 7th floor because the elevator isn't making stops in between during rain. Therefore, he has to take it all the way up.\n\nWait, but why would the elevator not stop at the 7th floor on rainy days? Maybe the elevator has a feature where it skips certain floors during bad weather. Or perhaps the man himself doesn't want to get his clothes wet by walking the stairs on rainy days, so he takes the elevator all the way up to avoid getting wet.\n\nBut the key here is that on rainy days, he takes the elevator all the way to the 10th floor. So, it's not just about avoiding stairs; it's about the elevator's behavior. Maybe the elevator only goes to the 10th floor on rainy days, so he can't get off earlier. Therefore, he has to take it all the way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the man lives on the 10th floor, and the elevator on rainy days only goes to the 10th floor, so he can't get off at the 7th floor. That would explain why he takes the elevator all the way up on rainy days.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the man takes the elevator to the ground floor every morning, works, and in the evening, on normal days, he takes the elevator up to the 7th floor and walks up the remaining 3 floors. But on rainy days, the elevator doesn't stop at the 7th floor, so he has to take it all the way up to the 10th floor. Therefore, the reason is that on rainy days, the elevator only stops at the ground floor and the top floor, so he can't get off at the 7th floor, forcing him to take the elevator all the way up.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe the elevator's design on rainy days only allows it to go up to the 10th floor, so he can't get off at the 7th floor. Therefore, he has to take it all the way up.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the man's apartment is on the 10th floor, and the elevator on rainy days only goes to the 10th floor, so he can't get off at the 7th floor. Therefore, he takes the elevator all the way up.\n\nI think the main point is that on rainy days, the elevator's operation is limited, so he can't get off at the 7th floor, hence he takes it all the way up. So, the reason is that on rainy days, the elevator only stops at the ground floor and the 10th floor, so he can't get off at the 7th floor, thus he has to take the elevator all the way up.\n\nAnother way to look at it is that the elevator might have a malfunction or a feature where it skips certain floors during bad weather, so on rainy days, he can't get off at the 7th floor, forcing him to take the elevator to the 10th floor.\n\nSo, in summary, the man takes the elevator all the way up on rainy days because the elevator isn't stopping at the 7th floor during rain, so he has to go all the way to the 10th floor.\n</think>\n\nThe man takes the elevator all the way up to the 10th floor on rainy days because the elevator doesn't stop at the 7th floor during rain. Therefore, he has to ride the elevator to the 10th floor. \n\nDONE."

Every morning, he takes the elevator down to the ground floor to go to work. In the evening, when he returns from work, he takes the elevator to the 7th floor and then walks up the stairs for the remaining three floors to his apartment. However, on rainy days, he takes the elevator all the way to the 10th floor. Why does he do this? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out why this man takes the elevator all the way to the 10th floor on rainy days. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand his usual routine. Every morning, he lives on the 10th floor and takes the elevator down to the ground floor (which is floor 1) to go to work. In the evening, when he returns, he takes the elevator up to the 7th floor and then walks up the remaining three floors to his apartment. So, on a typical day, he's using the elevator for part of his journey both ways.\n\nNow, on rainy days, he changes his routine. Instead of getting off at the 7th floor and walking up, he stays on the elevator all the way to the 10th floor. That means he's taking the elevator from the ground floor up to his apartment on rainy days. \n\nI wonder why this change happens only on rainy days. Maybe it has something to do with the weather affecting his commute. Let's think about the possible reasons:\n\n1. **Distance on Rainy Days:** Maybe the elevator is faster or more convenient when it's raining. If the elevator is quicker, he might prefer it over walking, especially if it's raining and he doesn't want to get wet or deal with slippery stairs.\n\n2. **Time Efficiency:** If the elevator is faster, he might save time by not having to walk up three flights. On rainy days, time could be a factor if he's in a hurry or wants to avoid being late.\n\n3. **Safety:** Rainy weather can make the stairs slippery, so he might prefer the safety of the elevator to avoid slipping and falling.\n\n4. **Convenience:** Maybe the elevator is more convenient when it's raining, or perhaps the building's elevator policy changes on rainy days, encouraging him to use it fully.\n\n5. **Building Rules:** The building might have a rule that on rainy days, residents are encouraged or required to take the elevator all the way, maybe for safety reasons or to prevent water damage from wet staircases.\n\n6. **Cost:** If the elevator uses less energy when moving fewer floors, maybe he's saving money on utilities, but that seems less likely as he still has to take the elevator all the way up.\n\n7. **Wet Clothing:** If he's returning from work and it's raining, he might not want to get his clothes wet by walking up the stairs, so he takes the elevator instead.\n\n8. **Building Maintenance:** Perhaps the stairs are getting slippery, so the building management advises against using them, encouraging the use of the elevator instead.\n\nLooking at these points, the most plausible reasons are safety and convenience. Rainy days can make the stairs slippery, so taking the elevator is safer. Additionally, on rainy days, he might not want to get wet, so walking up the stairs isn't ideal. Therefore, using the elevator all the way home on rainy days makes sense.\n\nSo, putting it all together, he takes the elevator to the 10th floor on rainy days because the stairs are slippery, and it's safer and more convenient to use the elevator instead of walking up.\n</think>\n\nThe man takes the elevator all the way to the 10th floor on rainy days because the stairs become slippery, posing a safety hazard. Walking up three flights in the rain can be dangerous and uncomfortable, so using the elevator is a safer and more convenient alternative.\n\nDONE."

However, on rainy days, he takes the elevator all the way to the 10th floor. Why does he do this? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out why this man takes the elevator down every morning to the ground floor and then in the evening, he goes up to the 7th floor and walks up three more floors. But on rainy days, he takes the elevator all the way to the 10th floor. Hmm, that's a bit puzzling. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, he lives on the 10th floor. Every morning, he takes the elevator down to the ground floor, which is the 1st floor. I guess he's going to work. In the evening, after work, he takes the elevator up to the 7th floor and then walks up three floors to his apartment on the 10th. So, why not just take the elevator all the way up? Maybe the elevator isn't running in the morning or evening, or perhaps it's too slow. Or maybe he's trying to save time or money.\n\nWait, but on rainy days, he takes the elevator all the way up. So, on rainy days, he doesn't walk up the stairs. That makes me think that on rainy days, maybe the stairs are wet or slippery, so he prefers the elevator. But why does he take the elevator down every morning? Maybe the elevator is faster or more convenient in the morning. Or perhaps he doesn't like walking down the stairs in the morning because it's slippery or takes too long.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the building has some rules about the elevator. For example, maybe during certain times, the elevator only goes up or down. But that doesn't quite fit because he takes it both ways on some days.\n\nWait, the key difference is that on rainy days, he takes the elevator all the way. So, maybe on rainy days, the elevator is more reliable, or perhaps the stairs are inaccessible because of the weather. So, he avoids the stairs when it's raining.\n\nBut why does he take the elevator down in the morning and then up to the 7th floor in the evening? Maybe he's trying to save time by taking the elevator part of the way, but on rainy days, he just takes the elevator all the way. Alternatively, maybe the elevator is out of service in the morning or evening, so he takes it only when it's available.\n\nWait, perhaps the building has a policy that the elevator doesn't go beyond a certain floor in the morning or evening. But that doesn't make sense because he can take it up to the 7th floor in the evening.\n\nWait, another thought: maybe the man works on the ground floor. So, he takes the elevator down in the morning to get to work, and in the evening, he goes up to the 7th floor and walks up because he needs to be on the 10th. On rainy days, maybe the ground floor is wet, or the stairs are wet, so he takes the elevator all the way to the 10th floor to avoid getting wet.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the man doesn't like walking up the stairs in the rain, so he takes the elevator. But why does he take the elevator down every morning? Maybe the elevator is faster, or he doesn't like walking down the stairs either, but that's not specified.\n\nWait, maybe the man has a preference for the elevator in the morning. Maybe he's in a hurry or doesn't like walking down the stairs. So, he takes the elevator every morning, even though he could walk down. But in the evening, he takes the elevator only part of the way because he doesn't mind walking up the stairs, unless it's raining.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the man takes the elevator down every morning because he prefers it, maybe for speed or convenience. In the evening, he takes the elevator up to the 7th floor and walks up the remaining three because that's quicker than waiting for the elevator, unless it's raining. On rainy days, he takes the elevator all the way up to avoid the wet stairs or because the elevator is more convenient when it's raining.\n\nI think that's the main reason. He uses the elevator in the morning because he prefers it, and in the evening, he uses the elevator part of the way unless it's raining, in which case he takes it all the way to avoid the wet stairs.\n</think>\n\nThe man takes the elevator down every morning because he prefers it, possibly for speed or convenience. In the evening, he takes the elevator up to the 7th floor and walks up the remaining three floors, as it's quicker than waiting for the elevator or because he doesn't mind the stairs. On rainy days, he takes the elevator all the way to avoid the wet stairs, making it a necessity rather than a choice.\n\nDONE."

Let me break down the information given and see if I can come up with a logical explanation.\n\nFirst, the man lives on the 10th floor. Every morning, he takes the elevator down to the ground floor to go to work. That makes sense because it's efficient\u2014he doesn't have to climb up 10 flights of stairs each morning.

Instead of getting off at the 7th floor, he takes the elevator all the way to the 10th floor. Why would he do that? Maybe there's something about the rain that makes him prefer going all the way up instead of walking up the stairs. \n\nLet me think about the possible reasons. One possibility is that walking up the stairs on rainy days is less convenient. Maybe the stairs are slippery when it's raining, so he prefers to take the elevator all the way to avoid getting wet or slipping. That makes sense because walking on wet stairs can be dangerous, especially if they're not well-maintained or if he's in a hurry. \n\nAnother angle could be that the elevator is faster or more comfortable. However, on normal days, he takes the elevator only to the 7th floor, so it's not about speed or comfort on rainy days specifically.

It's more probable that it's a personal preference to avoid the stairs in bad weather. \n\nSo, putting it all together, it's likely that on rainy days, he takes the elevator all the way to the 10th floor to avoid walking up the wet and potentially slippery stairs. This would explain why he changes his routine only on rainy days.\n</think>\n\nHe takes the elevator to the 10th floor on rainy days because the stairs are slippery, making walking up unsafe. \n\nDONE."

Why does he do this? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this puzzle here about a man living on the 10th floor of an apartment building. Every morning, he takes the elevator down to the ground floor to go to work. In the evening, after work, he takes the elevator up to the 7th floor and then walks up the stairs for the remaining three floors to his apartment. But here's the twist: on rainy days, he takes the elevator all the way to the 10th floor. The question is, why does he do this on rainy days?\n\nOkay, let me try to break this down. First, I need to figure out why he changes his routine on rainy days. Normally, he goes down to the ground floor in the morning, which makes sense if he's going to work. In the evening, he takes the elevator up to the 7th floor and then walks up three floors. So, why wouldn't he just take the elevator all the way up to the 10th floor every time?\n\nMaybe it has something to do with the elevator's behavior. Perhaps the elevator has certain limitations, especially on rainy days. Let me think about elevators in general. They have limits on their weight capacity, right? So maybe on rainy days, the elevator is heavier because it's wet, or maybe it's working harder, so it can't go all the way up. But wait, he lives on the 10th floor, so if the elevator can't handle the weight, it wouldn't make it up that high even on normal days. Hmm, that doesn't quite add up.\n\nAnother angle could be about the time the elevator takes. On rainy days, maybe the elevator is slower, so he doesn't want to be stuck inside for a longer time. But again, he's already taking it all the way to the 10th floor, which would be the slowest part. So that doesn't seem to fit.\n\nWait, maybe it's about the building's structure. Perhaps on rainy days, the elevator gets stuck if it goes too high. But if that were the case, he wouldn't be able to get up on rainy days either. Unless the elevator is designed differently on rainy days, but that seems a bit far-fetched.\n\nLet me think about the evening routine. He takes the elevator to the 7th floor and then walks up three floors. So normally, he doesn't take the elevator all the way because maybe the 7th floor is a common area, like a waiting area or a place where he meets someone or where the building's management is. On rainy days, perhaps he prefers to stay dry, so instead of walking up the stairs which might be slippery, he takes the elevator all the way up. But wait, that doesn't explain why he takes the elevator to the 7th floor on non-rainy days.\n\nOh, maybe the elevator only goes up to the 7th floor on rainy days. But that doesn't make much sense because the building's elevator should have a set limit. Unless the elevator's maximum height changes based on the weather, which is unlikely.\n\nWait another thought: maybe the man is trying to save money on rainy days by not taking the elevator all the way. But that doesn't make sense because he's already taking the elevator part of the way. Or perhaps he's trying to avoid getting his clothes wet if he walks up the stairs, so he takes the elevator instead. But then why wouldn't he do that on non-rainy days? He might prefer walking up the stairs when it's not raining.\n\nBut the question is why he does this specifically on rainy days. So maybe the key is that on rainy days, the elevator is more likely to malfunction if it goes beyond a certain floor, so he stays on the 7th floor. But again, that doesn't quite fit because he lives on the 10th floor, so he needs to get all the way up.\n\nWait, perhaps the elevator has a limit on the number of floors it can go up in a single trip. So on rainy days, it can only go up to the 7th floor, and then he has to walk up the stairs. But that doesn't explain why he takes the elevator to the 7th floor on non-rainy days. Unless the elevator's limit is higher on non-rainy days, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the man is trying to avoid getting his shoes wet on rainy days, so he takes the elevator all the way up instead of walking up the stairs. But then why wouldn't he do that on non-rainy days? He might prefer the exercise or the routine of walking up the stairs when it's not raining.\n\nWait, maybe the elevator only goes up to the 7th floor on rainy days because the building's maintenance restricts it to prevent water damage from the upper floors during rain. So, on rainy days, the elevator stops at the 7th floor to prevent water from entering the elevator shaft, which could damage the elevator or the building. Therefore, on rainy days, the man can't go beyond the 7th floor by elevator, so he takes it up to the 7th floor and then walks up the remaining three floors. But on non-rainy days, the elevator can go all the way up, so he takes it to the 10th floor.\n\nWait, but the problem says that on rainy days, he takes the elevator all the way to the 10th floor. So that contradicts my previous thought. If the elevator can't go beyond the 7th floor on rainy days, he wouldn't be able to get to the 10th floor. So maybe my assumption is wrong.\n\nLet me re-examine the problem. He lives on the 10th floor. Every morning, he takes the elevator down to the ground floor to work. In the evening, he takes the elevator to the 7th floor and walks up three floors. On rainy days, he takes the elevator all the way to the 10th floor. So the only difference is on rainy days, he takes the elevator all the way up, whereas on non-rainy days, he takes it up to the 7th floor and walks up.\n\nSo why would he do that? Maybe on rainy days, the elevator is faster or more convenient, but that doesn't seem to fit. Or perhaps on rainy days, he doesn't want to get his clothes wet by walking up the stairs, so he takes the elevator all the way up. But then, on non-rainy days, he might prefer the exercise or the routine of walking up the stairs.\n\nWait, another angle: maybe the elevator only goes up to the 7th floor on rainy days, so he has to walk up the stairs from there. But that contradicts the problem statement because on rainy days, he takes the elevator all the way to the 10th floor. So perhaps the elevator's limit is higher on rainy days, allowing it to go up to the 10th floor.\n\nBut why would the elevator's limit change on rainy days? That seems unlikely. Unless the man is using a different elevator on rainy days, but that's not mentioned.\n\nWait, perhaps the man is using a different route on rainy days. Maybe the building has a policy that the elevator doesn't go beyond the 7th floor on rainy days to prevent water damage, so on rainy days, he has to walk up the stairs from the 7th floor. But the problem says he takes the elevator all the way to the 10th floor on rainy days, which contradicts that.\n\nHmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the man is trying to avoid taking the stairs on rainy days because they're slippery, so he takes the elevator all the way up instead of walking up the stairs. But why wouldn't he do that on non-rainy days? He might prefer the exercise or the routine of walking up the stairs when it's not raining.\n\nWait, another possibility: the man is trying to save time on rainy days by taking the elevator all the way up, whereas on non-rainy days, he takes the elevator only part of the way and walks the rest. But that doesn't explain the specific behavior on rainy days.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the man is trying to avoid getting his shoes wet on rainy days, so he takes the elevator all the way up instead of walking up the stairs, which would make his shoes wet. But again, why wouldn't he do that on non-rainy days? He might prefer the exercise or the routine.\n\nWait, perhaps the man is using a different method on rainy days. Maybe the elevator is more reliable or faster on rainy days, so he takes it all the way up. But that seems a bit too vague.\n\nWait, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think of the simplest explanation. On rainy days, the man might prefer to stay dry, so instead of walking up the stairs which could be slippery and wet, he takes the elevator all the way up to his apartment. On non-rainy days, he's okay with walking up the stairs, so he takes the elevator only part of the way.\n\nBut the problem says that on rainy days, he takes the elevator all the way to the 10th floor. So that aligns with this idea. So the reason is that on rainy days, he doesn't want to get his shoes or clothes wet by walking up the stairs, so he takes the elevator all the way up instead.\n\nWait, but why would the stairs be a problem on rainy days? Stairs are usually on the outside, so they could be slippery. So by taking the elevator, he avoids the slippery stairs and stays dry.\n\nThat makes sense. So the key is that on rainy days, the stairs are wet and slippery, so he takes the elevator all the way up to avoid getting his clothes wet. On non-rainy days, the stairs are dry, so he takes the elevator only part of the way and walks up the stairs.\n\nSo the answer is that on rainy days, the stairs are slippery, so he takes the elevator all the way to stay dry.\n</think>\n\nHe takes the elevator all the way up on rainy days to avoid walking on slippery stairs. \n\nDONE."

But on rainy days, he takes the elevator all the way to the 10th floor. Hmm, that seems a bit odd. Let me try to break it down.\n\nFirst, he lives on the 10th floor. Every morning, he takes the elevator down to the ground floor, which is floor 1, I assume. So he goes from 10 to 1. Then, in the evening, after work, he takes the elevator up to the 7th floor and walks up three floors to his apartment on the 10th. Wait, that means he's taking the elevator up only part of the way. So, from 1 (ground floor) to 7, and then walking from 7 to 10. But why not just take the elevator all the way to 10? On rainy days, he does that, so maybe there's a reason he doesn't do it normally.\n\nLet me think about why someone would take the elevator part of the way and walk the rest. Maybe it's about the time it takes or something about the elevator's behavior. But the key difference is the rainy days. So perhaps on rainy days, the elevator doesn't go all the way, or maybe he prefers not to use it on rainy days for some reason. Or maybe the elevator has a limit, like it only goes up to a certain floor, but that seems unlikely because he takes it all the way to 10 on rainy days.\n\nWait, maybe it's about the elevator's speed or efficiency. If he takes the elevator all the way down in the morning, maybe it's faster. But in the evening, perhaps he's trying to avoid the elevator on rainy days, so he takes it only part of the way. Or maybe the elevator is out of order or something. Hmm, but the problem says he does this every evening, not just on rainy days.\n\nWait, maybe it's about the number of floors he walks. On rainy days, he takes the elevator all the way, so he doesn't have to walk at all. But on normal days, maybe he takes the elevator part of the way and walks the rest because he doesn't want to get wet or something. Wait, but he's taking the elevator in the evening regardless. So maybe the rainy day is a clue.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the building has some rule about the elevator not going all the way on rainy days, but that doesn't make much sense. Or perhaps the elevator is faster or more reliable when going down, so he takes it all the way down in the morning, but in the evening, he takes it only part of the way because it's slower or stops at 7. But that doesn't explain why on rainy days he takes it all the way.\n\nWait, maybe it's about the time he arrives at work. If he takes the elevator all the way down every morning, he might be late. So in the evening, he takes the elevator up to 7 and walks up because he can't be late. But that doesn't explain the rainy days.\n\nWait, maybe the elevator is broken or has a limit. If the elevator can only go up to the 7th floor, then on rainy days, he has to take it all the way down, but that doesn't fit because on rainy days he takes it all the way up. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the elevator is faster when going down, so he takes it all the way down in the morning, but in the evening, he takes it up to 7 because that's where the stairs are, and he can walk up the remaining three floors. But why would he do that instead of taking the elevator all the way? Maybe because he doesn't want to wait for the elevator on rainy days, so he takes it all the way up.\n\nWait, perhaps it's about the elevator's speed or the time it takes. If the elevator is slow, he might prefer to walk after a certain point. But that doesn't fully explain it.\n\nWait, another angle: maybe the man works on the 7th floor. So in the morning, he takes the elevator down to 1, goes to work on 7, and in the evening, he takes the elevator up to 7 and walks up to 10. But why not take the elevator all the way to 10 in the evening? Maybe because he doesn't want to be seen arriving at 10 on rainy days, or maybe he prefers to take the stairs on rainy days to keep dry. Wait, but he takes the elevator all the way on rainy days. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the man has a preference. He takes the elevator down every morning, but in the evening, he takes the elevator up to 7 and walks up because he likes the exercise or it's quicker after a certain point. But that doesn't explain the rainy days.\n\nWait, maybe the building's elevator has a rule where it doesn't go above the 7th floor on rainy days, so he has to take the stairs. But that's speculative.\n\nAlternatively, maybe he's trying to save time. If he takes the elevator up to 7 and walks up three floors, that's faster than waiting for the elevator to go all the way up. But on rainy days, he takes the elevator all the way, so maybe the elevator is faster on rainy days.\n\nWait, perhaps the elevator is more reliable or faster when it's raining, so he prefers to take it all the way. But that's just a guess.\n\nWait, maybe the man lives on the 10th floor, and in the morning, he takes the elevator down to the ground floor because he's in a hurry. In the evening, he takes the elevator up to the 7th floor because that's where the stairs are, and he can walk up the remaining three floors. But why on rainy days does he take the elevator all the way to 10? Maybe because on rainy days, he doesn't want to get wet, so he takes the elevator all the way. But in the evening, he takes the elevator to 7 and walks up because he doesn't mind the rain a little more.\n\nWait, that makes some sense. So, on normal days, he takes the elevator down in the morning, and in the evening, he takes it up to 7 and walks up because he doesn't mind walking a bit, maybe to save time or because he prefers it. But on rainy days, he takes the elevator all the way up to avoid getting wet.\n\nSo, the reason is that on rainy days, he takes the elevator all the way to his apartment to stay dry, while on normal days, he takes the elevator part of the way and walks the rest as a matter of preference or convenience.\n\nWait, but the problem says he does this every evening, not just on rainy days.

Every morning, he takes the elevator down to the ground floor. That makes sense because he's going to work, and probably the ground floor is where work is. So, that's his routine in the morning.\n\nIn the evening, when he returns from work, he takes the elevator to the 7th floor and then walks up the stairs for the remaining three floors. Wait, so from the 7th to the 10th floor is three floors? Let me count: 7 to 8 is one, 8 to 9 is two, and 9 to 10 is three. Yeah, that's correct. So, he's taking the elevator down to the 7th floor, which is three floors below his apartment, and then walking up three floors. That seems a bit odd because why wouldn't he just take the elevator all the way up to the 10th floor like usual? But on rainy days, he does take the elevator all the way to the 10th floor. So, there's something different happening on rainy days.\n\nMaybe it's about the weather. Rainy days might make him prefer taking the elevator because walking up the stairs could be slippery or uncomfortable. But then why does he take the elevator to the 7th floor on non-rainy days? That doesn't add up. Wait, maybe the elevator has a problem. Perhaps the elevator only goes up to the 7th floor, so after that, he has to walk up the stairs. But that doesn't explain why on rainy days he takes the elevator all the way to the 10th floor.\n\nHold on, maybe the man works on the 7th floor. So in the morning, he goes from the 10th floor down to the ground floor, maybe to a parking garage or somewhere else, and then takes the elevator up to his work floor, which is the 7th. But that doesn't fit because the problem says he goes to work from the ground floor, so maybe his work is on the ground floor.\n\nWait, no. Let me read the problem again. He takes the elevator down to the ground floor every morning to go to work. So, his work is on the ground floor. In the evening, he returns, takes the elevator to the 7th floor, and then walks up three floors. On rainy days, he takes the elevator all the way to the 10th floor. So, why would he take the elevator to the 7th floor on non-rainy days? Maybe because he doesn't want to get wet walking up the stairs on rainy days, so he takes the elevator all the way up, but on nice days, he prefers walking up the stairs instead of taking the elevator all the way because maybe the elevator is slow or he wants to save time walking instead of waiting for the elevator.\n\nWait, but the problem says he walks up the stairs for the remaining three floors in the evening on non-rainy days. So, perhaps on rainy days, he doesn't want to get his clothes wet walking up the stairs, so he takes the elevator all the way to the 10th floor. But why on non-rainy days does he take the elevator only to the 7th floor? Maybe the elevator is broken or stops at the 7th floor. So, after that, he has to walk up the stairs. But on rainy days, he can take the elevator all the way because maybe the elevator is working properly, or he doesn't mind getting a little wet because it's not raining.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the man lives on the 10th floor, but his work is on the 7th floor. Wait, no, the problem says he goes to work from the ground floor, so his work must be on the ground floor. So, he goes down to the ground floor in the morning, works there, and in the evening, he takes the elevator up to the 7th floor, which is three floors below his apartment, and then walks up three floors to reach his 10th floor apartment.\n\nBut why on rainy days does he take the elevator all the way to the 10th floor? Maybe because the elevator is faster or more convenient when it's raining, so he doesn't want to walk up the stairs in the rain. So, on rainy days, he takes the elevator all the way up, but on nice days, he takes the elevator part of the way and walks the rest.\n\nWait, but the problem says he takes the elevator to the 7th floor and then walks up three floors. So, on non-rainy days, he's taking the elevator down to the ground floor in the morning, and in the evening, he's taking the elevator up to the 7th floor and walking up three floors. On rainy days, he takes the elevator all the way to the 10th floor, which is his apartment.\n\nSo, maybe the elevator is only functional up to the 7th floor on non-rainy days, and on rainy days, it can go all the way up. Or perhaps the man prefers taking the stairs when it's not raining because he doesn't like the elevator's speed or the company. So, on rainy days, he uses the elevator all the way, but on nice days, he takes the elevator part of the way and walks the rest.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the man works on the 7th floor, but that doesn't fit because he goes to the ground floor in the morning. So, his work is on the ground floor, and in the evening, he goes back up, but he stops at the 7th floor and walks up three floors. On rainy days, he takes the elevator all the way because maybe the 7th floor is where he changes into wet-weather gear, and then he takes the elevator up to the 10th floor without getting wet.\n\nWait, that could make sense. So, in the evening, he comes back from work on the ground floor, takes the elevator up to the 7th floor, where he keeps some wet-weather clothing, and then he walks up three floors to his apartment. But on rainy days, he doesn't need to change into wet clothes, so he takes the elevator all the way to the 10th floor without stopping at the 7th floor.\n\nHmm, that might be a possible explanation. So, the man has a reason to stop at the 7th floor in the evening, perhaps to put on waterproof clothing before walking up the stairs. But on rainy days, he doesn't need to do that, so he takes the elevator all the way up.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the elevator is broken above the 7th floor on non-rainy days, so he can't go higher, hence he takes it to the 7th floor and walks up. But on rainy days, the elevator works properly, so he can go all the way up.\n\nBut the problem doesn't mention the elevator being broken, so that's probably not it.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the man has a preference. He likes taking the elevator part of the way and walking the rest on nice days because he enjoys the exercise or the fresh air. On rainy days, he doesn't want to get wet, so he takes the elevator all the way.\n\nSo, the key is that on rainy days, he doesn't want to walk up the stairs because it's raining, so he takes the elevator all the way to the 10th floor. On nice days, he takes the elevator part of the way and walks the remaining three floors because he prefers it that way.\n\nThat makes sense. So, the reason is that on rainy days, he doesn't want to get wet walking up the stairs, so he takes the elevator all the way. On nice days, he prefers walking up the stairs instead of taking the elevator all the way, perhaps because he doesn't like waiting for the elevator or it's faster to walk.\n\nSo, the answer is that on rainy days, he takes the elevator all the way to avoid getting wet walking up the stairs. On nice days, he takes the elevator to the 7th floor and walks up the stairs because he prefers it that way.\n\nI think that's the reasoning.\n</think>\n\nThe man takes the elevator all the way to the 10th floor on rainy days to avoid getting wet while walking up the stairs. On nice days, he prefers walking up the stairs after taking the elevator to the 7th floor, possibly for exercise or preference.\n\nDONE."
