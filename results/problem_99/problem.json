  "question": "A man lives on the 10th floor of an apartment building. Every morning, he takes the elevator down to the ground floor to go to work. In the evening, when he returns from work, he takes the elevator to the 7th floor and then walks up the stairs for the remaining three floors to his apartment. However, on rainy days, he takes the elevator all the way to the 10th floor. Why does he do this?",
  "answer": "The key to solving this problem is to look beyond conventional explanations like exercise or social interactions and consider physical limitations.\n\nStep 1: Analyze the pattern - the man only goes to the 7th floor on non-rainy days but goes all the way to the 10th floor when it's raining.\n\nStep 2: Consider what changes between rainy and non-rainy days that would affect elevator usage. Typically, rain affects visibility, mobility, or the use of certain items.\n\nStep 3: Think about potential physical limitations. The most logical explanation is that the man is short in stature and cannot reach the button for the 10th floor in the elevator.\n\nStep 4: On non-rainy days, he can only reach the 7th-floor button, so he must walk the remaining floors.\n\nStep 5: On rainy days, he carries an umbrella, which he can use to press the 10th-floor button, allowing him to ride directly to his floor.\n\nThe answer is that the man is too short to reach the 10th-floor button without assistance, but on rainy days, he can use his umbrella to press it."
