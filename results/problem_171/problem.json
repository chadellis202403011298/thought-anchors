  "question": "A hospital is evaluating two different surgical procedures for a particular condition. Procedure A has a 3% risk of minor complications and a 1% risk of major complications. Procedure B has a 2% risk of minor complications and a 1.5% risk of major complications. If the hospital values avoiding major complications twice as much as avoiding minor complications, which procedure represents the lower overall risk?",
  "answer": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the weighted risk for each procedure, giving twice as much weight to major complications compared to minor complications.\n\n1) For Procedure A:\n   - Minor complications: 3% (or 0.03)\n   - Major complications: 1% (or 0.01)\n   - Weighted risk = 0.03 + 2(0.01) = 0.03 + 0.02 = 0.05 or 5%\n\n2) For Procedure B:\n   - Minor complications: 2% (or 0.02)\n   - Major complications: 1.5% (or 0.015)\n   - Weighted risk = 0.02 + 2(0.015) = 0.02 + 0.03 = 0.05 or 5%\n\nSince both procedures have the same weighted risk of 5%, neither procedure represents a lower overall risk when considering the given weights for complications. The hospital would need to consider other factors to decide between these procedures, as they are equivalent in terms of the weighted risk assessment."
