  "question": "Prove, using the method of contradiction, that there is no largest integer. In other words, prove that given any integer n, there always exists an integer m such that m > n.",
  "answer": "To prove that there is no largest integer using proof by contradiction, I'll follow these steps:\n\n1. First, assume the opposite of what we want to prove. So I'll assume there IS a largest integer.\n2. Let's call this largest integer L.\n3. Now, consider the integer L + 1.\n4. By the properties of integers, L + 1 is also an integer.\n5. Since L + 1 > L, we now have an integer larger than L.\n6. But this contradicts our assumption that L is the largest integer.\n7. Since we've reached a logical contradiction, our initial assumption must be false.\n8. Therefore, there cannot be a largest integer.\n\nThis proves that given any integer n, there will always exist another integer (specifically n + 1) that is larger than n."
