  "question": "A sheet of paper has a single hole punched through it. You fold the paper exactly once along a straight line. What is the maximum number of holes that could appear when looking at the folded paper from above? Explain your reasoning.",
  "answer": "The maximum number of holes that could appear when looking at the folded paper from above is 2 holes.\n\nReasoning process:\n1. Initially, we have a single hole in the paper.\n2. When we fold the paper once along a straight line, there are two possible scenarios:\n   a) The fold line passes through the hole: In this case, the hole gets split along the fold, but when viewed from above, it still appears as a single hole.\n   b) The fold line does not pass through the hole: In this case, the original hole can be positioned such that when the paper is folded, the hole on one side of the paper aligns with a non-hole portion on the other side.\n3. The maximum number of holes visible occurs when the fold does not pass through the hole and the hole on one side of the paper does not overlap with any part of the paper on the other side after folding.\n4. In this optimal case, the original hole creates one visible hole, and its 'image' after folding creates another visible hole.\n5. Therefore, the maximum number of holes visible from above after folding once is 2 holes."
