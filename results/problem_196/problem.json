  "question": "A weather forecasting model uses a Markov chain to predict daily weather patterns. When it's sunny today, there's a 70% chance it will be sunny tomorrow and a 30% chance it will rain. When it's rainy today, there's a 40% chance it will be sunny tomorrow and a 60% chance it will continue to rain. If today is sunny, what is the probability that it will be sunny exactly 2 days from now?",
  "answer": "To solve this problem, we need to use the properties of Markov chains to find the probability of being in a sunny state two days from now, given that today is sunny.\n\nLet's denote the states as:\n- S = Sunny\n- R = Rainy\n\nThe transition probabilities are:\n- P(S\u2192S) = 0.7 (probability of staying sunny)\n- P(S\u2192R) = 0.3 (probability of sunny changing to rainy)\n- P(R\u2192S) = 0.4 (probability of rainy changing to sunny)\n- P(R\u2192R) = 0.6 (probability of staying rainy)\n\nTo find the probability of being sunny two days from now, we need to consider all possible paths from today (sunny) to sunny two days later:\n\nPath 1: Sunny \u2192 Sunny \u2192 Sunny\nProbability = P(S\u2192S) \u00d7 P(S\u2192S) = 0.7 \u00d7 0.7 = 0.49\n\nPath 2: Sunny \u2192 Rainy \u2192 Sunny\nProbability = P(S\u2192R) \u00d7 P(R\u2192S) = 0.3 \u00d7 0.4 = 0.12\n\nThe total probability of being sunny exactly 2 days from now is the sum of these two paths:\n0.49 + 0.12 = 0.61 or 61%\n\nTherefore, if today is sunny, there's a 61% probability that it will be sunny exactly 2 days from now."
