  "question": "Consider the following statement: 'For any integer n, if n\u00b2 is even, then n is even.' Using mathematical logic, determine whether this statement is true or false. If false, provide a counterexample.",
  "answer": "To determine whether the statement is true or false, I need to analyze the logical implication: 'if n\u00b2 is even, then n is even.'\\n\\nStep 1: I'll use proof by contrapositive, which states that 'if P, then Q' is logically equivalent to 'if not Q, then not P'.\\n\\nStep 2: The contrapositive of our statement is: 'If n is not even, then n\u00b2 is not even.' In other words, 'If n is odd, then n\u00b2 is odd.'\\n\\nStep 3: Let's verify this. If n is odd, then n = 2k + 1 for some integer k.\\n\\nStep 4: Calculate n\u00b2: n\u00b2 = (2k + 1)\u00b2 = 4k\u00b2 + 4k + 1 = 2(2k\u00b2 + 2k) + 1\\n\\nStep 5: Since 2(2k\u00b2 + 2k) is clearly even, and adding 1 makes the result odd, we've proven that if n is odd, then n\u00b2 is odd.\\n\\nStep 6: Since the contrapositive is true, our original statement 'if n\u00b2 is even, then n is even' must also be true.\\n\\nTherefore, the given statement is true."
