Using mathematical logic, determine whether this statement is true or false. If false, provide a counterexample. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out if the statement \"For any integer n, if n\u00b2 is even, then n is even.\" is true or false. If it's false, I have to come up with a counterexample. Okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the statement is saying. It's a conditional statement: If n squared is even, then n must be even. In logical terms, that's like saying if P, then Q, where P is \"n\u00b2 is even\" and Q is \"n is even.\" So, symbolically, it's P \u2192 Q.\n\nNow, I remember that in logic, a conditional statement P \u2192 Q is only false when P is true, and Q is false. So, to disprove this statement, I need to find an integer n where n\u00b2 is even (so P is true), but n itself is not even (so Q is false). That would make the statement false, and n would be my counterexample.\n\nLet me think about even and odd numbers. An even number is any integer divisible by 2, right? So, if n is even, then n = 2k for some integer k. Squaring that, n\u00b2 = (2k)\u00b2 = 4k\u00b2, which is definitely even because it's divisible by 4.\n\nBut what if n is odd? An odd number can be written as n = 2k + 1 for some integer k. Squaring that gives n\u00b2 = (2k + 1)\u00b2 = 4k\u00b2 + 4k + 1 = 4k(k + 1) + 1. Since either k or k + 1 is even, 4k(k + 1) is divisible by 8, but the +1 makes the whole thing odd. So, if n is odd, n\u00b2 is odd.\n\nWait a minute, so if n is odd, n\u00b2 is odd, and if n is even, n\u00b2 is even. So, the statement says that if n\u00b2 is even, then n is even. But from what I just thought, it seems like n\u00b2 being even only happens when n is even. So, is the statement true?\n\nBut the problem is asking me to determine if it's true or false. Maybe I'm missing something. Let's try some numbers to test.\n\nTake n = 2. It's even. n\u00b2 = 4, which is even. So, 2 is even, and 4 is even. That fits.\n\nn = 3. It's odd. n\u00b2 = 9, which is odd. So, that also fits.\n\nn = 4. Even. n\u00b2 = 16. Even. Fits.\n\nn = 5. Odd. n\u00b2 = 25. Odd. Fits.\n\nWait, but what about negative integers? Let's try n = -2. Even. n\u00b2 = 4. Even.\n\nn = -3. Odd. n\u00b2 = 9. Odd.\n\nHmm, same results.\n\nWait, but I feel like I might be missing something. Let me think again. The statement is: If n\u00b2 is even, then n is even. So, whenever n\u00b2 is even, n must be even. But from my earlier reasoning, n\u00b2 is even only when n is even. So, that would make the statement true because there's no case where n\u00b2 is even and n is odd.\n\nBut the problem is asking me to determine if it's true or false, implying that it might be false. Maybe I'm wrong. Let me try to find a counterexample. Suppose there exists an integer n where n\u00b2 is even, but n is not even, meaning n is odd.\n\nBut wait, if n is odd, n\u00b2 is odd, right? Because an odd number times an odd number is odd. So, n\u00b2 would be odd, not even. Therefore, there is no integer n where n\u00b2 is even and n is odd. That means the statement is actually true.\n\nWait, but that contradicts the initial thought that maybe it's false. Maybe I was overcomplicating it. Let me check with zero. n = 0. Zero is even. n\u00b2 = 0, which is even. So that fits.\n\nn = 1. Odd. n\u00b2 = 1. Odd. Fits.\n\nn = -1. Odd. n\u00b2 = 1. Odd.\n\nn = -4. Even. n\u00b2 = 16. Even.\n\nOkay, I can't find any integer where n\u00b2 is even and n is odd. So, the statement must be true.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"using mathematical logic,\" so maybe there's a logical way to analyze it without examples.\n\nLet me recall that in logic, P \u2192 Q is equivalent to \u00acP \u2228 Q. So, the statement \"if n\u00b2 is even, then n is even\" is equivalent to \"either n\u00b2 is not even or n is even.\" Now, n\u00b2 is even if and only if n is even, because if n is even, n\u00b2 is even, and if n is odd, n\u00b2 is odd.\n\nSo, n\u00b2 is even \u2194 n is even.\n\nTherefore, the statement is equivalent to \"if n is even, then n is even,\" which is a tautology, meaning it's always true. So, the original statement is true.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit circular. Let me think again.\n\nIf n\u00b2 is even, then n must be even. But n\u00b2 is even if and only if n is even. So, the statement is true because whenever n\u00b2 is even, n is even.\n\nTherefore, the statement is true.\n\nBut wait, I'm confused because I thought maybe it's false, but all my examples support it being true. Maybe the problem is trying to trick me, but I can't see how. Let me try to see if I can find a case where n\u00b2 is even, but n is not even.\n\nSuppose n is a non-integer? Wait, no, the problem specifies integers. So, n must be an integer.\n\nWait, but what about n = 0? Zero is even, and 0\u00b2 = 0, which is even. So, that's fine.\n\nWhat about n = 2k, where k is an integer. Then n\u00b2 = 4k\u00b2, which is even. So, yes, if n is even, n\u00b2 is even.\n\nConversely, if n\u00b2 is even, then n must be even because if n were odd, n\u00b2 would be odd, which contradicts n\u00b2 being even.\n\nTherefore, the statement is true.\n\nWait, but I'm supposed to determine if it's true or false. So, based on this reasoning, it's true.\n\nBut let me check again. Let's suppose n is even: n=2k, n\u00b2=4k\u00b2, which is even. If n is odd: n=2k+1, n\u00b2=4k\u00b2+4k+1=2(2k\u00b2+2k)+1, which is odd. So, n\u00b2 is even if and only if n is even. Therefore, the original statement is true.\n\nSo, the conclusion is that the statement is true.\n</think>\n\nThe statement \"For any integer n, if n\u00b2 is even, then n is even.\" is true because if n\u00b2 is even, n must be even. There are no counterexamples since the square of an odd integer is always odd.\n\nDONE."

Using mathematical logic, determine whether this statement is true or false. If false, provide a counterexample. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I've got this problem here that says, \"For any integer n, if n\u00b2 is even, then n is even.\" I need to figure out if this statement is true or false. If it's false, I also have to provide a counterexample. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, let me understand what the statement is saying. It's talking about integers n. So n can be any whole number, positive, negative, or zero. The condition given is that n squared is even. Then, the conclusion is that n itself must be even. So, logically, it's saying that if n\u00b2 is even, then n is even.\n\nNow, I remember that in math, statements like this can often be tricky because they seem obvious, but sometimes they aren't. So, I should approach this carefully. Maybe I can start by recalling some basic properties of even and odd numbers.\n\nAn even number is any integer that can be written as 2 times another integer. So, if n is even, then n = 2k for some integer k. Then, n squared would be (2k)\u00b2 = 4k\u00b2, which is definitely even because it's divisible by 2.\n\nBut the statement is the other way around. It says that if n\u00b2 is even, then n must be even. So, I need to check if the converse is true. In other words, is it true that if a square of a number is even, the number itself has to be even?\n\nLet me think about what happens when you square an odd number. If n is odd, then n can be written as 2k + 1 for some integer k. Then, n squared would be (2k + 1)\u00b2 = 4k\u00b2 + 4k + 1, which simplifies to 4k(k + 1) + 1. Since either k or (k + 1) is even, 4k(k + 1) is divisible by 8, making n\u00b2 = 8m + 1, which is odd because it's 1 more than a multiple of 8.\n\nWait, so if n is odd, n\u00b2 is odd, and if n is even, n\u00b2 is even. So, the square of an even number is even, and the square of an odd number is odd. That means that if n\u00b2 is even, n must be even. So, the original statement seems to be true.\n\nBut wait, the problem is asking me to determine if it's true or false, and if false, to provide a counterexample. So, am I missing something here?\n\nLet me think again. Maybe I should test some specific numbers to see if there's any case where n\u00b2 is even, but n is not even. Let's try n = 2. n\u00b2 = 4, which is even, and n is even. Good.\n\nWhat about n = 3? n\u00b2 = 9, which is odd, and n is odd. That fits.\n\nHow about n = 0? n\u00b2 = 0, which is even, and n is even (since 0 is considered even). So, that works too.\n\nWait, what about negative numbers? Let's try n = -2. n\u00b2 = 4, which is even, and n is even. Yep, that's consistent.\n\nn = -3? n\u00b2 = 9, odd, and n is odd. Still consistent.\n\nHmm, I'm not seeing any counterexamples here. All the even numbers I've tried, their squares are even, and all the odd numbers I've tried, their squares are odd. So, it seems like the statement holds true.\n\nBut the problem is phrased as if it might not be true, asking to determine if it's true or false. Maybe I need to think about whether there are any integers where n\u00b2 is even but n is not even. But from my reasoning and examples, that doesn't seem to happen.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider non-integer numbers? No, the problem specifies integers, so that's not necessary.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps I'm misunderstanding the statement. It says \"for any integer n, if n\u00b2 is even, then n is even.\" So, it's a conditional statement. In logic, this is equivalent to saying that the set of integers where n\u00b2 is even is a subset of the integers where n is even.\n\nFrom what I know, squares of even numbers are even, and squares of odd numbers are odd. So, there are no integers where n\u00b2 is even and n is odd. Therefore, the statement is true.\n\nBut wait, the problem is asking to determine if it's true or false, implying that it might be false. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me double-check.\n\nIs there any integer n where n\u00b2 is even, but n is not even? Let me think about n = 1. n\u00b2 = 1, which is odd, and n is odd. That's fine. n = 2, even, square is 4, even. n = 4, same thing. n = -4, same as 4.\n\nWhat about larger numbers? n = 6, square is 36, even. n = 7, square is 49, odd. So, no, I don't see any exceptions.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the case where n is zero. n = 0, which is even, and n\u00b2 = 0, which is even. So, that's consistent.\n\nIs there any number where n\u00b2 is even and n is odd? From my reasoning, no, because if n is odd, n = 2k + 1, then n\u00b2 = 4k\u00b2 + 4k + 1 = 4k(k + 1) + 1, which is 1 more than a multiple of 4, so it's odd.\n\nTherefore, the statement is true. There is no counterexample.\n\nWait, but the problem says to determine if it's true or false. If it's true, I don't need to provide a counterexample. But maybe I should still write that there is no counterexample.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm wrong, and there is a counterexample. Let me try to see.\n\nSuppose n is such that n\u00b2 is even, but n is not even. So, n must be odd. But from earlier, n\u00b2 is odd when n is odd. So, that's a contradiction. Therefore, no such n exists.\n\nSo, the statement is true. There is no counterexample.\n\nWait, but the problem is phrased as a question, so maybe I should just confirm.\n\nYes, the statement is true because if n\u00b2 is even, then n must be even. There are no integers where n\u00b2 is even and n is odd.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that the statement is true, and there is no counterexample.\n</think>\n\nThe statement \"For any integer n, if n\u00b2 is even, then n is even.\" is true. This is because the square of an even number is even, and the square of an odd number is odd. Therefore, there are no integers n for which n\u00b2 is even and n is odd.\n\n**Answer:** The statement is true. DONE."

If false, provide a counterexample. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out if the statement \"For any integer n, if n\u00b2 is even, then n is even.\" is true or false. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, I remember that in logic, a statement like \"If P, then Q\" is called an implication, and it's written as P \u2192 Q. Here, P is \"n\u00b2 is even\" and Q is \"n is even.\" So, the statement is saying that whenever n squared is even, n itself must be even.\n\nI think a good starting point is to recall some basic number theory. I know that the square of an integer can be even or odd, depending on what the integer is. If n is even, then n\u00b2 will definitely be even because multiplying two even numbers gives an even result. But what if n is odd? Well, an odd number times an odd number is odd, so n\u00b2 would be odd in that case.\n\nWait a minute, so if n\u00b2 is even, n must be even because only even numbers can produce an even square. That seems to support the original statement. But I'm a bit confused because sometimes in math, things aren't always as straightforward as they seem. Maybe there's a special case or a number that doesn't follow this rule.\n\nLet me think about some examples. Let's pick n = 2. 2 is even, and 2\u00b2 = 4, which is even. That fits the statement. Now, let's try n = 3, which is odd. 3\u00b2 = 9, which is odd. So, when n is odd, n\u00b2 is odd. That also fits. How about n = 0? Zero is even, and 0\u00b2 = 0, which is even. Okay, that works too. What about negative numbers? Let's try n = -2. -2 is even, and (-2)\u00b2 = 4, which is even. Similarly, n = -3 is odd, and (-3)\u00b2 = 9, which is odd. So far, all the examples I've tried support the statement.\n\nBut wait, is there any integer n where n\u00b2 is even, but n itself is not even? If I can find such a number, then the statement would be false. Let's consider n = \u221a2. Hmm, \u221a2 is not an integer, so that doesn't count. What about n = 1? 1 is odd, and 1\u00b2 = 1, which is odd. Nope, that doesn't work. How about n = \u221a4? That's 2, which is even. So, n\u00b2 = 4 is even, and n = 2 is even. Still fits.\n\nI'm starting to think that maybe the statement is actually true. But I should double-check to make sure I'm not missing something. Let me think about the properties of even and odd numbers. An even number can be expressed as 2k, where k is an integer, and an odd number as 2k + 1. If n is even, n = 2k, so n\u00b2 = (2k)\u00b2 = 4k\u00b2, which is clearly even. If n is odd, n = 2k + 1, so n\u00b2 = (2k + 1)\u00b2 = 4k\u00b2 + 4k + 1 = 4k(k + 1) + 1. Since either k or k + 1 is even, 4k(k + 1) is divisible by 8, making n\u00b2 \u2261 1 mod 8, which is odd. So, n\u00b2 is even only when n is even.\n\nThat seems pretty conclusive. But just to be thorough, let me consider all possible integer values. For any integer n, it's either even or odd. If it's even, as shown earlier, n\u00b2 is even. If it's odd, n\u00b2 is odd. Therefore, there's no integer n where n\u00b2 is even and n is odd. That means the original statement holds true for all integers.\n\nI guess I was overcomplicating it at first, but after breaking it down and testing with examples, it seems clear that the statement is true. I don't think I've missed any edge cases because I've covered all possibilities\u2014both even and odd integers, positive and negative. Plus, the algebraic proof using modular arithmetic confirms it. So, I'm confident that the statement is indeed true.\n</think>\n\nThe statement is true. For any integer n, if n\u00b2 is even, then n must be even.\n\nDONE."

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the statement is saying. It's talking about integers n and their squares. The statement is in the form of a conditional: If n squared is even, then n must be even. So, in logical terms, it's saying that if P (n\u00b2 is even), then Q (n is even). \n\nNow, I remember from math class that if you square an even number, the result is even, and if you square an odd number, the result is odd. So, let's test this with some examples.\n\nLet me take n = 2. That's even. Squaring it gives 4, which is even. So, here, P is true, and Q is also true. That fits the statement.\n\nNext, let's try n = 3. That's odd. Squaring it gives 9, which is odd. So, P is false, and Q is false. That also fits the statement because in logic, if the premise is false, the implication is automatically true.\n\nNow, let's see if there's a case where P is true but Q is false. Because if such a case exists, then the statement is false. \n\nWait a minute, I think I remember something about negative numbers. Let me test n = -2. That's even. Squaring it gives 4, which is even. So, again, P is true, Q is true.\n\nWhat about n = -3? That's odd. Squaring it gives 9, which is odd. So, P is false, Q is false.\n\nHmm, so far, all the examples I've tried where P is true (n\u00b2 even) have Q true (n even). But I'm trying to find a case where P is true but Q is false. Maybe I should think about numbers that are not integers? Wait, the statement is about integers, so non-integer numbers don't apply here.\n\nWait, another thought: what about n = 0? Zero is even. Squaring it gives 0, which is even. So P is true, Q is true.\n\nIs there any integer where n squared is even, but n itself is odd? Let me think. If n is odd, then n can be written as 2k + 1 for some integer k. Squaring that gives (2k + 1)\u00b2 = 4k\u00b2 + 4k + 1 = 2(2k\u00b2 + 2k) + 1, which is odd. So, if n is odd, n squared is odd. Therefore, if n squared is even, n cannot be odd. That means n must be even.\n\nWait, so that suggests that the statement is actually true. Because if n squared is even, n has to be even. There's no integer where n squared is even and n is odd.\n\nBut let me double-check with some more examples. Let's try n = 4. Even, squared is 16, which is even.\n\nn = 5. Odd, squared is 25, which is odd.\n\nn = -4. Even, squared is 16, even.\n\nn = -5. Odd, squared is 25, odd.\n\nSo, in all these cases, when n squared is even, n is even. And when n is odd, n squared is odd.\n\nTherefore, the statement seems to hold true. There's no counterexample where n squared is even, but n is odd.\n\nWait, but I thought maybe negative numbers could trick me, but no, negative even numbers squared are positive and even, and negative odd numbers squared are positive and odd. So, the sign doesn't affect the parity of the square.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the statement is true because if n squared is even, n must be even. There's no integer where n squared is even and n is odd.\n</think>\n\nThe statement is true. If \\( n^2 \\) is even, then \\( n \\) must be even.

If it's false, I also need to provide a counterexample.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the statement. It's a conditional statement in logic, which is usually written as \"If P, then Q.\" In this case, P is \"n\u00b2 is even\" and Q is \"n is even.\" So the statement is: If n\u00b2 is even, then n is even.\n\nI remember that in logic, a conditional statement P \u2192 Q is only false when P is true and Q is false.

An even number is any integer divisible by 2, and an odd number is one that isn't. When you square an even number, the result is even because (2k)\u00b2 = 4k\u00b2, which is divisible by 2. When you square an odd number, the result is odd because (2k+1)\u00b2 = 4k\u00b2 + 4k + 1, which is 2*(2k\u00b2 + 2k) + 1, so it's odd.\n\nWait, so if n is even, n\u00b2 is even, and if n is odd, n\u00b2 is odd. So n\u00b2 being even only happens when n is even. That would mean the original statement is true because whenever n\u00b2 is even, n must be even.\n\nBut let me make sure I'm not missing something. Maybe there's a case where n\u00b2 is even, but n is odd. Let me try plugging in some numbers.\n\nTake n = 2, which is even. n\u00b2 = 4, which is even. So that works.\n\nNow, take n = 3, which is odd. n\u00b2 = 9, which is odd. So again, n\u00b2 is odd when n is odd.\n\nWhat about negative integers? Let's try n = -2. n\u00b2 = 4, even. n is even.\n\nn = -3. n\u00b2 = 9, odd. n is odd.\n\nSo in all these cases, n\u00b2 being even corresponds to n being even, and n\u00b2 being odd corresponds to n being odd.\n\nTherefore, the statement seems to hold true because there's no integer n where n\u00b2 is even but n is odd.\n\nWait, but the question is asking to determine if the statement is true or false. Based on my analysis, it seems true. But sometimes, I might overlook something. Let me think again.\n\nIs there any integer n where n\u00b2 is even, but n is odd? Suppose n is odd. Then n can be written as 2k + 1 for some integer k. Then n\u00b2 = (2k + 1)\u00b2 = 4k\u00b2 + 4k + 1 = 2*(2k\u00b2 + 2k) + 1, which is odd. So n\u00b2 is odd when n is odd.\n\nConversely, if n is even, n = 2k. Then n\u00b2 = 4k\u00b2, which is even.\n\nSo there's no overlap where n\u00b2 is even and n is odd. Therefore, the statement is true.\n\nBut wait, the initial problem says \"for any integer n.\" So if n is any integer, positive, negative, or zero, the statement holds because evenness and oddness are preserved when squaring.\n\nSo, the statement is true because n\u00b2 being even necessarily means that n is even.\n</think>\n\nThe statement \"For any integer n, if n\u00b2 is even, then n is even.\" is true because the square of an even number is even, and the square of an odd number is odd. There are no integers where n\u00b2 is even without n being even.\n\nDONE."

Even integers are numbers like 2, 4, 6, etc., which are divisible by 2 without any remainder. Odd integers are numbers like 1, 3, 5, etc., which have a remainder of 1 when divided by 2.\n\nNow, the statement is talking about n squared being even. So, let me recall that squaring an even number gives an even result, and squaring an odd number also gives an odd result. Wait, is that right? Let me check with some examples.\n\nTake n = 2, which is even. 2 squared is 4, which is even. Okay, that fits. Now, take n = 3, which is odd. 3 squared is 9, which is odd. Hmm, that also fits. So, if n is even, n\u00b2 is even; if n is odd, n\u00b2 is odd. That seems consistent.\n\nBut the statement is saying, \"If n\u00b2 is even, then n is even.\" So, it's making a claim that whenever you have a square that's even, the original number must have been even. But from my examples, I see that both even and odd numbers have squares that are even and odd respectively. So, does that mean the statement is true? Wait, no, because the statement is phrased as a conditional. Let me think about it in logical terms.\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is only false when P is true, and Q is false. So, in this case, P is \"n\u00b2 is even,\" and Q is \"n is even.\" The statement is true unless there exists an integer n where n\u00b2 is even, but n itself is not even.\n\nFrom my earlier examples, when n is even, n\u00b2 is even. When n is odd, n\u00b2 is odd. So, there's no case where n\u00b2 is even but n is odd. That suggests that the statement is actually true because the implication holds in all possible cases. But wait, I'm confused because sometimes in math, things aren't always as straightforward as they seem.\n\nLet me approach this more formally. Let's use some algebra. Suppose n is an integer. If n is even, then n can be written as 2k, where k is an integer. Then, n\u00b2 = (2k)\u00b2 = 4k\u00b2, which is clearly even because it's a multiple of 2. If n is odd, then n can be written as 2k + 1. Then, n\u00b2 = (2k + 1)\u00b2 = 4k\u00b2 + 4k + 1 = 4k(k + 1) + 1. Since either k or k + 1 is even, 4k(k + 1) is a multiple of 8, making n\u00b2 = 8m + 1, which is odd.\n\nSo, algebraically, it seems that n\u00b2 is even only when n is even, and n\u00b2 is odd when n is odd. Therefore, the original statement holds true because there's no integer n where n\u00b2 is even but n is odd. That would mean the statement is true.\n\nBut wait, am I missing something? Let me think again. Is there any integer n where n\u00b2 is even, but n is not even? From my reasoning, no. Because if n is odd, n\u00b2 is odd; if n is even, n\u00b2 is even. So, the two are directly linked. Therefore, the statement is true.\n\nI think I was overcomplicating it at first, but breaking it down step by step, both through examples and algebra, confirms that the statement is true. There's no need for a counterexample because none exists.\n</think>\n\nThe statement is **true**. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Understand the Statement:** The statement claims that for any integer n, if the square of n (n\u00b2) is even, then n itself must be even.\n\n2. **Define Even and Odd Integers:**\n   - **Even Integer:** An integer can be expressed as 2k, where k is an integer.\n   - **Odd Integer:** An integer can be expressed as 2k + 1, where k is an integer.\n\n3. **Analyze Squaring Even and Odd Integers:**\n   - If n is even (n = 2k), then n\u00b2 = (2k)\u00b2 = 4k\u00b2, which is clearly even.\n   - If n is odd (n = 2k + 1), then n\u00b2 = (2k + 1)\u00b2 = 4k\u00b2 + 4k + 1 = 4k(k + 1) + 1. Since either k or k + 1 is even, 4k(k + 1) is a multiple of 8, making n\u00b2 = 8m + 1, which is odd.\n\n4. **Conclusion from Analysis:**\n   - When n is even, n\u00b2 is even.\n   - When n is odd, n\u00b2 is odd.\n   - Therefore, there is no integer n where n\u00b2 is even, but n is odd.\n\n5. **Validity of the Original Statement:**\n   - The statement \"If n\u00b2 is even, then n is even\" holds true because the condition n\u00b2 being even only occurs when n is even.\n\n**Final Answer:** The statement is true. DONE."

    "solution": "Solve this problem step by step. End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: Consider the following statement: 'For any integer n, if n\u00b2 is even, then n is even.' Using mathematical logic, determine whether this statement is true or false. If false, provide a counterexample. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this math problem to solve, and I need to figure out whether the statement 'For any integer n, if n\u00b2 is even, then n is even.' is true or false. If it's false, I have to provide a counterexample. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the statement is saying. It's a conditional statement: If n squared is even, then n must be even. In logical terms, it's like saying \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"n\u00b2 is even\" and Q is \"n is even.\" So, the statement is P \u2192 Q.\n\nNow, I remember that in logic, a conditional statement P \u2192 Q is only false when P is true, and Q is false. So, to determine if this statement is true or false, I should look for cases where P is true, and Q is false. If I can find such a case, then the statement is false. If I can't find any such cases, then the statement is true.\n\nLet me start by recalling some properties of even and odd numbers. An even number is any integer that can be written as 2k, where k is an integer. An odd number is any integer that can be written as 2k + 1, where k is an integer. When you square an even number, the result is even, and when you square an odd number, the result is odd. \n\nWait, let me verify that. If n is even, say n = 2k, then n\u00b2 = (2k)\u00b2 = 4k\u00b2, which is clearly even. If n is odd, say n = 2k + 1, then n\u00b2 = (2k + 1)\u00b2 = 4k\u00b2 + 4k + 1 = 4k(k + 1) + 1, which is odd because it's 1 more than an even number. So, squaring an even number gives an even result, and squaring an odd number gives an odd result.\n\nGiven that, let's analyze the original statement: If n\u00b2 is even, then n is even. From what I just thought through, if n is even, n\u00b2 is even. But what if n\u00b2 is even? Does that necessarily mean n is even?\n\nWell, suppose n\u00b2 is even. Then, according to the properties, n must be even because only even numbers square to even numbers. So, it seems like the statement should be true.\n\nBut wait, I need to be careful here. Let me consider all possible cases. The integers are divided into even and odd numbers. We've established that:\n\n- Even number squared is even.\n- Odd number squared is odd.\n\nSo, if n\u00b2 is even, n must be even because odd numbers squared are odd. Therefore, there's no integer n where n\u00b2 is even and n is odd. That means the implication P \u2192 Q is always true because P cannot be true without Q also being true.\n\nBut let me think again to make sure I'm not missing something. Maybe I should test some numbers to confirm.\n\nLet's take n = 2, which is even. n\u00b2 = 4, which is even. So, the statement holds.\n\nNow, n = 3, which is odd. n\u00b2 = 9, which is odd. So, the statement doesn't apply here because the hypothesis P is false.\n\nWhat about n = 0? 0 is even. 0\u00b2 = 0, which is even. So, again, the statement holds.\n\nn = -2: Even number. (-2)\u00b2 = 4, even. Statement holds.\n\nn = -3: Odd. (-3)\u00b2 = 9, odd. Again, the statement doesn't apply because P is false.\n\nWait, but can n be a non-integer? The problem says \"for any integer n,\" so n is an integer. Therefore, n can be positive, negative, or zero, but it's always either even or odd.\n\nGiven that, I can't think of any integer n where n\u00b2 is even and n is odd. Therefore, the statement seems to hold true.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider if there's any edge case I might be missing. For example, what about n = 1? 1\u00b2 = 1, which is odd, so P is false. So, the implication P \u2192 Q is true because a false hypothesis makes the entire implication true, regardless of Q.\n\nSimilarly, n = -1: (-1)\u00b2 = 1, odd. Again, P is false, so implication is true.\n\nIs there any integer n where n\u00b2 is even but n is odd? From my earlier reasoning, no. Because if n is odd, n\u00b2 is odd. So, n\u00b2 being even implies n is even.\n\nTherefore, the statement is true because there's no counterexample where n\u00b2 is even and n is odd.\n\nBut wait, let me think about this again. Maybe I'm confusing something. Suppose n is even, then n\u00b2 is even. But the converse is not necessarily true. Wait, no, in this case, the original statement is about if n\u00b2 is even, then n is even. So, it's not the converse. The converse would be if n is even, then n\u00b2 is even, which is true.\n\nBut the original statement is a conditional: If P, then Q. And as I've established, P cannot be true without Q being true. Therefore, the implication holds.\n\nI think I've covered all possible cases. There's no integer n where n\u00b2 is even and n is odd. Hence, the statement is true.\n</think>\n\nThe statement is true because if n\u00b2 is even, n must be even. There are no integers where n\u00b2 is even and n is odd.\n\nDONE."

Using mathematical logic, determine whether this statement is true or false. If false, provide a counterexample. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this math problem to solve, and I need to figure out if the statement \"For any integer n, if n\u00b2 is even, then n is even.\" is true or false. If it's false, I have to come up with a counterexample. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I remember that in math, when we hear \"for any integer n,\" it means we're dealing with a universal statement. So, it's saying that for every integer n, if n squared is even, then n itself must be even. Hmm, that makes sense on the surface because I know that squaring an even number keeps it even, but what about odd numbers?\n\nWait, let me think. If n is even, then n squared is even. That part is straightforward. But the statement is saying the opposite: if n squared is even, then n must be even. So, it's making a claim about all integers, not just the even ones. That makes me wonder, what happens when n is odd?\n\nI recall that an odd number can be written as 2k + 1, where k is an integer. If I square that, (2k + 1)\u00b2 = 4k\u00b2 + 4k + 1 = 2(2k\u00b2 + 2k) + 1. That simplifies to 2 times some integer plus 1, which is still odd. So, if n is odd, n squared is odd. That means that if n squared is even, n can't be odd. Therefore, n must be even.\n\nWait, so does that mean the original statement is true? Because if n squared is even, n has to be even. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me test it with some numbers to confirm.\n\nTake n = 2, which is even. 2 squared is 4, which is even. That fits the statement. Now, let's try n = 3, which is odd. 3 squared is 9, which is odd. That also fits. How about n = 0? 0 squared is 0, which is even, and 0 is even. Okay, that works too. What about negative integers? Let's try n = -4. (-4) squared is 16, which is even, and -4 is even. Good. How about n = -3? (-3) squared is 9, which is odd, and -3 is odd. That still holds.\n\nSo, in all these cases, the statement seems to hold true. But I'm still a bit confused because the original statement is phrased as \"if n squared is even, then n is even.\" It's a conditional statement, and in logic, I know that conditionals can sometimes be tricky because they rely on the implication. So, if the condition (n squared is even) is false, the implication is automatically true, regardless of the conclusion.\n\nWait, let me think about that again. In logic, the statement \"If P, then Q\" is only false when P is true, and Q is false. So, if n squared is even (P), then n is even (Q). So, the statement is only false if n squared is even, but n is not even. But from my earlier reasoning, I don't think such an n exists because if n squared is even, n must be even.\n\nBut let me double-check. Suppose n squared is even. Then, n squared is divisible by 2. So, n squared = 2k for some integer k. Now, if n squared is 2k, then n must be even because if n were odd, as I showed earlier, n squared would be odd, which contradicts n squared being even. Therefore, n must be even.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I don't see any integers where n squared is even, but n is odd. Therefore, the statement seems to be true. But wait, I think I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me test n = 1. 1 squared is 1, which is odd. That doesn't violate the statement because the statement is about when n squared is even. So, the statement only applies when n squared is even, not when it's odd.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the contrapositive. The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P,\" and they are logically equivalent. So, the contrapositive here would be \"If n is not even, then n squared is not even.\" Which makes sense because if n is odd, n squared is odd, so n squared isn't even. So, that supports the original statement being true.\n\nBut wait, let me think about n = 0 again. 0 is even, and 0 squared is 0, which is even. That works. How about n = -2? (-2) squared is 4, which is even, and -2 is even. So, that also works. I can't think of any integer where n squared is even, but n is odd. It seems like such an integer doesn't exist.\n\nTherefore, I think the original statement is true because for any integer n, if n squared is even, n must be even. There's no counterexample where n squared is even, but n is odd. So, the statement holds true.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let's consider all possibilities. If n is even, n squared is even. If n is odd, n squared is odd. Therefore, the only way for n squared to be even is for n to be even. So, the implication is always true because there's no case where n squared is even, and n is odd. That means the statement is true.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes in logic, statements can have exceptions. But in this case, I don't see any exceptions. Every integer either is even or odd. If it's even, n squared is even. If it's odd, n squared is odd. Therefore, the only way for n squared to be even is for n to be even. So, the implication is always true.\n\nSo, after thinking through it, I believe the statement is true. There's no need for a counterexample because such a counterexample doesn't exist. All integers either have even squares when they are even or odd squares when they are odd. There's no overlap where an odd integer has an even square.\n\nTherefore, the statement \"For any integer n, if n\u00b2 is even, then n is even.\" is true.\n</think>\n\nThe statement is true.\n\nDONE."

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the statement is saying. It's a conditional statement where the hypothesis is \"n\u00b2 is even\" and the conclusion is \"n is even.\" So, in logical terms, it's saying if P then Q, where P is \"n\u00b2 is even\" and Q is \"n is even.\"\n\nI remember that in math, if something squared is even, does that necessarily mean the original number is even? Let me think about even and odd numbers. An even number is any integer that can be divided by 2 without leaving a remainder, right? So, if n is even, then n = 2k for some integer k. Then, n\u00b2 would be (2k)\u00b2 = 4k\u00b2, which is definitely even because it's a multiple of 4.\n\nBut what if n is odd? An odd number can be written as 2k + 1. Then, n\u00b2 would be (2k + 1)\u00b2 = 4k\u00b2 + 4k + 1 = 4k(k + 1) + 1. Now, since either k or k + 1 is even, 4 times that is still even, so 4k(k + 1) is even, and adding 1 makes it odd. So, if n is odd, n\u00b2 is odd.\n\nWait a minute, so if n is odd, n\u00b2 is odd, and if n is even, n\u00b2 is even. That means that n\u00b2 being even only happens when n is even. So, the statement seems to hold.\n\nBut to make sure, let me test with some examples. Let's pick even numbers first.\n\nTake n = 2. n\u00b2 = 4, which is even, and n is even. Okay, that works.\n\nHow about n = 4? n\u00b2 = 16, even, and n is even. Still holds.\n\nNow, what about odd numbers?\n\nn = 3. n\u00b2 = 9, which is odd. So, n\u00b2 is odd here, which aligns with the earlier reasoning.\n\nn = 5. n\u00b2 = 25, odd again.\n\nSo, in all these examples, when n\u00b2 is even, n is even, and when n\u00b2 is odd, n is odd. That seems consistent.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should think about negative integers too. Since the statement says \"for any integer n,\" it includes negatives.\n\nTake n = -2. n\u00b2 = 4, which is even, and n is even. That works.\n\nn = -3. n\u00b2 = 9, odd, and n is odd. Still consistent.\n\nIs there a case where n\u00b2 is even, but n is odd? From the examples, it doesn't seem possible. Because squaring an odd number always gives an odd result.\n\nSo, logically, the statement \"if n\u00b2 is even, then n is even\" should be true for all integers n.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any integer where n\u00b2 is even and n is odd. Suppose n is odd, so n = 2k + 1. Then n\u00b2 = (2k + 1)\u00b2 = 4k\u00b2 + 4k + 1 = 2(2k\u00b2 + 2k) + 1, which is clearly odd because it's 2 times something plus 1. So, n\u00b2 can't be even if n is odd.\n\nTherefore, the statement is true because the only way n\u00b2 is even is if n itself is even.\n</think>\n\nThe statement is true because the square of an integer is even if and only if the integer itself is even. Therefore, there is no counterexample where n\u00b2 is even but n is odd.\n\nDONE."

If it's false, I also have to provide a counterexample.\n\nFirst, let me understand the statement properly. It says that if you take any integer n, and if the square of n (n\u00b2) is even, then n itself must be even. So, in logical terms, it's like saying:\n\nIf P (n\u00b2 is even), then Q (n is even).\n\nSo, the statement is of the form P \u2192 Q.\n\nI remember that in logic, a conditional statement P \u2192 Q is only false when P is true and Q is false. So, to disprove this statement, I need to find an integer n where n\u00b2 is even (so P is true), but n itself is not even (so Q is false).\n\nIn other words, I need to find an integer n such that:\n\n1. n\u00b2 is even (P is true)\n2. n is odd (Q is false)\n\nIf I can find such an integer, then the original statement is false.\n\nNow, let's think about whether such an integer exists.\n\nI know that squaring an even number results in an even number. For example, 2\u00b2 = 4, which is even. Similarly, 4\u00b2 = 16, also even. So, when n is even, n\u00b2 is even.\n\nBut what happens when n is odd? Let's take an odd number, say 3. 3\u00b2 = 9, which is odd. Similarly, 5\u00b2 = 25, which is also odd. It seems that when n is odd, n\u00b2 is odd. So, in this case, n\u00b2 is odd, which means P is false, so the implication P \u2192 Q is automatically true regardless of Q.\n\nBut the statement is about when n\u00b2 is even. So, if n\u00b2 is even, then n must be even. From the examples I just did, when n is even, n\u00b2 is even, and when n is odd, n\u00b2 is odd. So, does that mean that if n\u00b2 is even, n must be even?\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there any integer n where n\u00b2 is even but n is odd? From what I recall, no, because squaring an odd number always results in an odd number.\n\nLet me test another odd number, say 7. 7\u00b2 = 49, which is odd. So, n\u00b2 is odd when n is odd.\n\nTherefore, it seems that if n\u00b2 is even, n must be even because only even numbers have even squares.\n\nSo, does that mean the original statement is true?\n\nWait, but I should make sure. Let me consider negative integers as well because the statement says \"any integer n.\"\n\nTake n = -2. (-2)\u00b2 = 4, which is even, and n is even. So, that's consistent.\n\nTake n = -3. (-3)\u00b2 = 9, which is odd, and n is odd. So, again, consistent.\n\nWhat about n = 0? 0\u00b2 = 0, which is even, and 0 is even. So, that's fine.\n\nn = 1. 1\u00b2 = 1, which is odd, and n is odd. So, that's consistent.\n\nn = 2. 2\u00b2 = 4, even, n even.\n\nn = -1. (-1)\u00b2 = 1, odd, n odd.\n\nSo, in all cases, when n is even, n\u00b2 is even; when n is odd, n\u00b2 is odd.\n\nTherefore, if n\u00b2 is even, n must be even because there's no odd integer whose square is even.\n\nSo, the statement seems to be true.\n\nBut wait, I thought initially that maybe there's a case where n\u00b2 is even but n is odd. But from the examples, it doesn't happen.\n\nTherefore, the statement is true.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I remember something about even and odd numbers and squares. Let me think again.\n\nAn even number can be written as 2k, where k is an integer. So, (2k)\u00b2 = 4k\u00b2, which is clearly even.\n\nAn odd number can be written as 2k + 1. So, (2k + 1)\u00b2 = 4k\u00b2 + 4k + 1 = 4k(k + 1) + 1. Since either k or k + 1 is even, 4k(k + 1) is divisible by 8, making the entire expression 8m + 1, which is odd.\n\nSo, mathematically, it's proven that the square of an even number is even, and the square of an odd number is odd.\n\nTherefore, if n\u00b2 is even, n must be even.\n\nSo, the statement is true.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes logical statements can have tricky parts. Let me double-check.\n\nThe statement is: For any integer n, if n\u00b2 is even, then n is even.\n\nSo, symbolically, \u2200n \u2208 \u2124, (n\u00b2 is even) \u2192 (n is even).\n\nTo prove this, we can use proof by contrapositive. The contrapositive of P \u2192 Q is \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP, and they are logically equivalent.\n\nSo, the contrapositive would be: If n is not even (i.e., n is odd), then n\u00b2 is not even (i.e., n\u00b2 is odd).\n\nFrom earlier, we saw that if n is odd, n\u00b2 is odd. Therefore, the contrapositive is true, which means the original statement is true.\n\nTherefore, the statement is true, and there is no counterexample because no odd integer has an even square.\n\nSo, the conclusion is that the statement is true.\n</think>\n\nThe statement is true because if n\u00b2 is even, n must be even. No odd integer has an even square.\n\nDONE."
