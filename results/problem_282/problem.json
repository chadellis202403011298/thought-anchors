  "question": "A local medical researcher is studying a rare disease called Hyperion Syndrome. After examining patient records, she makes the following statements:\n\n1. All patients with Hyperion Syndrome have elevated cortisol levels.\n2. Some patients with elevated cortisol levels do not have Hyperion Syndrome.\n3. All patients with Hyperion Syndrome have experienced chronic fatigue.\n\nBased on these statements, which of the following is true?\n\nA) Having elevated cortisol levels is a sufficient condition for having Hyperion Syndrome.\nB) Having elevated cortisol levels is a necessary condition for having Hyperion Syndrome.\nC) Experiencing chronic fatigue is a sufficient condition for having Hyperion Syndrome.\nD) Neither elevated cortisol levels nor chronic fatigue is a necessary condition for Hyperion Syndrome.",
  "answer": "The correct answer is B) Having elevated cortisol levels is a necessary condition for having Hyperion Syndrome.\n\nLet's analyze each statement and understand necessary versus sufficient conditions:\n\n- A necessary condition is something that must be present for an outcome to occur. If X is necessary for Y, then Y cannot occur without X (if Y, then X).\n\n- A sufficient condition is something that guarantees an outcome. If X is sufficient for Y, then X always leads to Y (if X, then Y).\n\nNow let's examine the given statements:\n\n1. \"All patients with Hyperion Syndrome have elevated cortisol levels\" means that elevated cortisol is a necessary condition for Hyperion Syndrome. If someone has Hyperion Syndrome, they must have elevated cortisol levels.\n\n2. \"Some patients with elevated cortisol levels do not have Hyperion Syndrome\" means that elevated cortisol alone is not enough to guarantee Hyperion Syndrome. This tells us that elevated cortisol is not a sufficient condition.\n\n3. \"All patients with Hyperion Syndrome have experienced chronic fatigue\" means that chronic fatigue is also a necessary condition for Hyperion Syndrome.\n\nChecking each option:\n\nA) False - Statement 2 directly contradicts this. Elevated cortisol is not sufficient since some people with elevated cortisol don't have the syndrome.\n\nB) True - Statement 1 directly supports this. Everyone with Hyperion Syndrome has elevated cortisol, making it necessary.\n\nC) False - While chronic fatigue is necessary (all patients with the syndrome have it), we don't know if it's sufficient. The statements don't tell us whether everyone with chronic fatigue has Hyperion Syndrome.\n\nD) False - Both elevated cortisol levels and chronic fatigue are necessary conditions as stated in statements 1 and 3.\n\nTherefore, B is the correct answer."
