  "question": "A cube has the letters A, B, C, D, E, and F on its six faces, with one letter on each face. When the cube is in its initial position, the letter A is on top, the letter B is on the front face, and the letter C is on the right face. If you roll the cube forward (so that the front face becomes the top face), and then roll it to the right (so that the right face becomes the top face), which letter will be on the bottom face of the cube?",
  "answer": "To solve this problem, we need to track how the faces of the cube change through the two rotations.\n\nInitial position:\n- Top: A\n- Front: B\n- Right: C\n- Bottom: (unknown, let's call it X)\n- Left: (unknown, but not needed for this problem)\n- Back: (unknown, but not needed for this problem)\n\nStep 1: Roll the cube forward. This means the cube rotates so the front face (B) becomes the top face.\nAfter rolling forward:\n- Top: B (former front)\n- Front: X (former bottom)\n- Right: C (remains right)\n- Bottom: (former back, not needed yet)\n- Back: A (former top)\n\nStep 2: Roll the cube to the right. This means the right face (C) becomes the top face.\nAfter rolling right:\n- Top: C (former right)\n- Right: (former back, not needed)\n- Front: X (remains front)\n- Left: B (former top)\n- Bottom: (former left, not needed)\n- Back: (former right, not needed)\n\nBut we need to determine which letter is on the bottom after both rotations. Let's consider the opposite faces of a cube:\n- If A is on top initially, then X (the unknown letter) is on the bottom\n- After rolling forward, A moves to the back, and its opposite (X) moves to the front\n- After rolling right, A is now on the left (opposite to where C was), and X is still on the front\n- The bottom face after both rotations must be the opposite of the top face (C)\n\nSince we know that each face has a unique letter (A through F), and C is on top after both rotations, the bottom face must have the letter that is opposite to C on the cube.\n\nIn the initial position, if C is on the right face, then its opposite face is the left face. Let's call this letter D for now.\n\nAfter the first roll (forward), C remains on the right and D remains on the left.\n\nAfter the second roll (to the right), C becomes the top face, and therefore D must become the bottom face.\n\nSo the letter on the bottom face after both rotations is D."
