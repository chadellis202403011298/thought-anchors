  "question": "Imagine a square sheet of paper. You make one straight cut across the paper, from one point on the edge to another point on the edge. What is the maximum number of pieces you can divide the paper into with this single cut? Now, imagine you make a second straight cut across the paper. What is the maximum number of pieces you can now have? Explain your reasoning.",
  "answer": "For a single straight cut across a square sheet of paper:\n\nWhen we make one straight cut from one edge to another edge, we will always divide the paper into exactly 2 pieces. This is because a straight line connecting two points on the boundary of a square will always partition the square into two separate regions. Topologically, a straight line cannot create more than two distinct regions in a connected planar shape when the line starts and ends at the boundary.\n\nFor two straight cuts across the paper:\n\nWith two straight cuts, the maximum number of pieces possible is 4. This occurs when the second cut intersects the first cut. \n\nReasoning:\n1. The first cut divides the paper into 2 pieces.\n2. The second cut can cross through both existing pieces, with each piece being divided into 2 sub-pieces.\n3. Therefore, 2 pieces can become 4 pieces (2 + 2) with the addition of the second cut.\n\nTo achieve this maximum, the two cuts must intersect each other within the boundaries of the square. If the second cut is parallel to the first or if they only meet at the boundary, fewer than 4 pieces would result.\n\nThis follows the general formula that n straight cuts can create a maximum of (n\u00b2+n+2)/2 regions when optimally placed."
