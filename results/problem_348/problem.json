  "question": "Four students are discussing theories about why plants grow toward light. Which one of their statements describes a scientifically falsifiable claim?\n\nA) Maria: 'Plants grow toward light because they have an inherent spiritual connection to the sun's energy.'\n\nB) Alex: 'Plants grow toward light because they contain a hormone called auxin that accumulates on the shaded side, causing cells there to elongate more than on the light-exposed side.'\n\nC) Jamal: 'Plants grow toward light because it is their purpose in nature to seek illumination.'\n\nD) Lisa: 'Plants grow toward light because that's just what plants have always done throughout history.'",
  "answer": "The correct answer is B) Alex's statement.\n\nTo determine which statement is falsifiable, we need to examine each claim and ask: 'Can this claim be tested in a way that could potentially prove it false?'\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA) Maria's claim about 'spiritual connection' is not falsifiable because spiritual connections cannot be objectively measured or tested. There's no experiment that could definitively disprove the existence of such a connection.\n\nB) Alex's claim about the hormone auxin is falsifiable because it makes specific, testable predictions. We could design experiments to:\n   - Block auxin production or transport and see if plants still bend toward light\n   - Measure auxin concentrations on both sides of the plant stem\n   - Apply auxin artificially to see if it causes bending\n   If these experiments produced results inconsistent with the theory, the claim would be falsified.\n\nC) Jamal's claim about 'purpose in nature' is not falsifiable because purpose or teleology is a philosophical concept that cannot be empirically tested. We cannot design an experiment to prove or disprove that something has an inherent purpose.\n\nD) Lisa's claim is simply a historical observation without a causal mechanism. It doesn't make testable predictions about why plants behave this way, so it doesn't qualify as a falsifiable scientific theory.\n\nAlex's statement is the only one that provides a specific mechanism (auxin accumulation) that can be tested through experiments, potentially proven false, and therefore meets the criterion of falsifiability that is essential to scientific theories."
