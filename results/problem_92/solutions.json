The inspector examines 8 widgets and records their weights in grams: 145, 146, 145, 146, 145, 146, 159, 145. Based on this data, which widget is most likely defective, and what pattern in the data leads to this conclusion? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out which widget is most likely defective based on the weights recorded by the inspector. The weights are: 145, 146, 145, 146, 145, 146, 159, 145. Hmm, okay, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I should look at the data and see if there's a pattern or something that stands out. I remember that in quality control, defective items often show up when there's an outlier in the data\u2014something that doesn't fit with the rest. So, let me list out the weights again to get a clear picture:\n\n145, 146, 145, 146, 145, 146, 159, 145.\n\nLooking at these numbers, most of them are around 145 grams, and a few are 146 grams. That seems pretty consistent, right? But then there's that one outlier at 159 grams. That seems way higher than the others. Maybe that's the defective one?\n\nWait, but before I jump to conclusions, maybe I should check if 159 is just a typo or if it's actually significantly different. Let me see the difference between 159 and the others. The others are all in the 140s, and 159 is almost 14 grams heavier. That seems like a big difference. In manufacturing, even a small deviation can indicate a problem, especially if it's consistent in one direction.\n\nAlso, I notice that 159 is the only number that's higher than the rest. If there was a defective widget, it might either be underweight or overweight. In this case, it's overweight. So, that could mean it's either a manufacturing defect where the widget is overfilled, or maybe it's a counterfeit or something else. But the question is about identifying the defective one, so I think the key here is the outlier.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me see how the rest of the data behaves. The majority are 145 and 146. There's a pattern where they alternate between 145 and 146, except for the last one, which is 145. So, the sequence is 145, 146, 145, 146, 145, 146, 159, 145. That's interesting. It's almost like a seesaw, going up and down slightly, but then it jumps up to 159 and then back down to 145.\n\nI wonder if there's any significance to the position of the 159. It's the seventh widget. Maybe there's a pattern in the order, but I'm not sure. Maybe the inspector noticed something about the packaging or the way it was handled, but that's probably beyond the data given.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whether the factory has a specific tolerance range for the weight of the widgets. If all widgets should be within a certain range, say 144-147 grams, then 159 is way outside. But since the problem doesn't specify, I have to go by the data given.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the widget that stands out is the one with 159 grams. It's the only one significantly higher than the others, which suggests it might be defective. The pattern here is that it's an outlier in the data, deviating from the general consistency of the rest of the weights.\n\nI think I've considered the main points. The defective widget is likely the one weighing 159 grams because it's the outlier, while the others are much closer to each other. This deviation from the norm is a strong indicator of a defective product.\n</think>\n\nThe defective widget is most likely the one weighing 159 grams. This is evident because it significantly deviates from the norm of the other weights, which are clustered around 145-146 grams. The presence of an outlier suggests a potential defect.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **List the weights:** 145, 146, 145, 146, 145, 146, 159, 145.\n\n2. **Identify the majority pattern:** Most weights are 145 or 146 grams, alternating slightly.\n\n3. **Spot the outlier:** The weight 159 grams stands out as significantly higher than the others.\n\n4. **Assess the deviation:** 159 grams is about 14 grams heavier than the nearest weight, indicating a potential defect.\n\n5. **Conclude the defective widget:** The 159-gram widget is the likely defective one due to its outlier status.\n\n**Answer:** The defective widget is the one weighing 159 grams. The pattern indicating this is the presence of an outlier in the data, which deviates significantly from the majority of the weights.\n\nDONE."

Based on this data, which widget is most likely defective, and what pattern in the data leads to this conclusion? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out which widget is most likely defective based on the weights recorded by the inspector. Let me start by looking at the data provided: 145, 146, 145, 146, 145, 146, 159, 145. Hmm, okay, so there are eight widgets, and their weights are mostly around 145 grams, with a few exceptions.\n\nFirst, I notice that most of the weights are either 145 or 146. That's pretty consistent. Let me count how many times each weight occurs. \n\nStarting from the first weight: 145, 146, 145, 146, 145, 146, 159, 145. So, 145 appears four times, and 146 appears three times. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me recount. \n\n1. 145\n2. 146\n3. 145\n4. 146\n5. 145\n6. 146\n7. 159\n8. 145\n\nOkay, so 145 is there four times: positions 1, 3, 5, and 8. 146 is at positions 2, 4, and 6\u2014so three times. Then there's a single outlier at position 7, which is 159 grams. \n\nNow, thinking about quality control, defective widgets usually stand out because they don't meet the expected specifications. So, if all the widgets should be identical, the ones that deviate from the norm are suspects. \n\nIn this case, the majority are 145 or 146. 145 is slightly more common. The single 159 is way higher than the others. That makes me think that 159 is the defective one because it's significantly heavier than the rest. \n\nBut wait, could there be another pattern? Maybe the inspector made a mistake when recording the weights, like misreading a number or something. But looking at the data, the weights increase by 1 each time: 145, 146, 145, 146, etc. Except for the last one, which jumps to 159. That sudden jump seems like an error or a defective widget. \n\nAlso, considering that 159 is much higher, it's unlikely that it's just a measurement error because the other weights are all so close. If it were a measurement error, the numbers would probably be close to the correct value, not so far off. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the widget with 159 grams is the most likely defective because it's the only one significantly different from the rest, and it breaks the pattern of the others being either 145 or 146. \n\nI don't see any other pattern here. Maybe if there was a different kind of pattern, like alternating weights or something, but that doesn't seem to be the case. The sudden increase to 159 is the clear outlier. \n\nTherefore, the defective widget is the one weighing 159 grams, and the pattern leading to this conclusion is the presence of a single value that's significantly higher than the rest, which suggests it doesn't belong.\n</think>\n\nThe defective widget is the one weighing 159 grams. This is evident because it's the only value significantly higher than the rest, which are mostly around 145-146 grams. The pattern indicating a defective widget is the presence of an outlier that deviates substantially from the majority.\n\nDONE."

The problem says all widgets should be identical, so a big difference might indicate a defect. Let me see how much higher 159 is compared to the others.\n\nThe majority are 145 and 146. Let's count them:\n\n- 145 grams: 1, 3, 5, 8 \u2192 that's four times.\n- 146 grams: 2, 4, 6 \u2192 three times.\n- 159 grams: 7 \u2192 once.\n\nSo, 159 is an outlier.

Based on this data, which widget is most likely defective, and what pattern in the data leads to this conclusion? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I've got this problem where a quality control inspector is checking a bunch of widgets, and they want to find out which one is most likely defective. The inspector has recorded the weights of 8 widgets as follows: 145, 146, 145, 146, 145, 146, 159, 145. I need to figure out which widget stands out and what pattern makes it suspect.\n\nOkay, first step, I think I should look at the data and see if there's a pattern or something unusual. All the widgets are supposed to be identical, so any significant deviation might indicate a defective one. Let me list out the weights again to have a clear view:\n\n145, 146, 145, 146, 145, 146, 159, 145.\n\nHmm, most of these are either 145 or 146 grams. Those are pretty close to each other. The first seven are all either 145 or 146, and then the last one is 159. That's a big jump, right? 159 is way higher than the others. So maybe that one is defective.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure. Maybe there's another pattern. Let me count how many times each weight appears. \n\n145 appears how many times? Let's see: first, third, fifth, seventh, and eighth. Wait, no, the seventh is 159, so the eighth is 145. So that's five times. \n\n146 appears three times: second, fourth, and sixth.\n\n159 appears once.\n\nSo the majority are 145, which is five times, and 146 is three times. So 145 is more common. \n\nBut the 159 is way out. Maybe that's the defective one because it's too heavy. \n\nBut why would a defective widget be heavier? Well, maybe the defective one is either underweight or overweight. In this case, 159 is heavier. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look for another pattern. Like, maybe the differences between the weights. Let's see:\n\n145, 146 (diff +1), 145 (diff -1), 146 (+1), 145 (-1), 146 (+1), 159 (+13), 145 (-14).\n\nWait, that's interesting. The differences alternate between +1 and -1, except for the last two. The last one jumps by +13 to 159, and then the next one drops by -14 to 145. That seems odd. \n\nBut the last one is 145, which is the majority weight. So maybe the big jump from 145 to 159 is the defective one. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the order. Are they supposed to be in a certain order? Maybe they were supposed to be in ascending or descending order? Let me see. \n\nThey are listed as 145, 146, 145, 146, 145, 146, 159, 145. \n\nIf they were supposed to be in order, maybe? Or perhaps the order doesn't matter. \n\nBut the big jump is from 146 to 159. So that's a big difference. The others are all close. So the 159 is way off.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the defective one is the one that's either too low or too high, and in this case, 159 is too high, so it's defective.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the 159 is the odd one out. It's way heavier than the others, and the differences suggest it's the defective one.\n</think>\n\nThe widget with a weight of 159 grams is the most likely defective. This is evident because it significantly deviates from the majority weights (145 and 146 grams), indicating a potential manufacturing defect or quality control issue.\n\nDONE."

Based on this data, which widget is most likely defective, and what pattern in the data leads to this conclusion? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this problem where a quality control inspector is checking boxes of widgets. All the widgets should be identical, but sometimes there might be defective ones that are different. The inspector has looked at 8 widgets and recorded their weights in grams: 145, 146, 145, 146, 145, 146, 159, 145. The question is asking which widget is most likely defective and what pattern in the data leads to that conclusion.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what makes a widget defective in this context. Since all good widgets should have the same weight, any widget that deviates from the standard weight is a candidate for being defective. So, the first step is to identify which of these weights don't match the majority or the expected standard.\n\nLooking at the data: 145, 146, 145, 146, 145, 146, 159, 145.\n\nI notice that most of the weights are either 145 or 146 grams. Let's count how many times each weight occurs.\n\n- 145 grams: Let's count. The first one is 145, then the third, fifth, seventh, and eighth. Wait, no, the eighth is 145. So that's 1, 3, 5, 7, 8. That's five times.\n\n- 146 grams: The second, fourth, sixth. That's three times.\n\n- 159 grams: Once.\n\nSo, 145 occurs five times, 146 occurs three times, and 159 occurs once.\n\nSince 145 is the most frequent weight, it's likely that 145 grams is the standard weight for a good widget. The ones that are defective would be the ones that don't match this standard.\n\nSo, the 159-gram widget is the only one that's significantly higher than the standard. It's 14 grams heavier than the others. That could indicate a defect, maybe something wrong with the widget that caused it to weigh more, like a manufacturing issue.\n\nOn the other hand, the 146-gram widgets are also close to the standard, but since they occur less frequently, it's less likely they're defective. They might just be within normal variation, especially if the factory allows for a small tolerance range.\n\nWait, but the problem says all widgets should be identical. So any deviation should be considered defective. But sometimes, minor deviations within a certain range could be acceptable, depending on the quality control standards. However, since the question doesn't specify any tolerance range, I should assume that any deviation from the majority is defective.\n\nSo, the 159-gram widget is the only one that's different, and it's significantly higher. Therefore, it's the most likely defective one.\n\nAlternatively, could the 146-gram widgets be defective? Well, since they're closer to the majority, but they occur less frequently. If the majority is 145, and 146 is just one gram more, it's possible that 146 is within an acceptable tolerance, but again, without knowing the tolerance, it's safer to assume that any deviation makes it defective.\n\nBut in this case, since 146 is just one gram more and occurs three times, while 159 is 14 grams more and only once, it's more likely that 159 is the defective one.\n\nSo, the pattern here is that the defective widget is the one that deviates significantly from the majority. The majority is 145, so any widget that doesn't match 145 is a candidate. Since 159 is way higher, it's the most likely defective.\n</think>\n\nThe defective widget is the one weighing 159 grams. This is because it deviates significantly from the majority weight of 145 grams, which is the standard for good widgets. The 159-gram widget is the only one that stands out, making it the most likely defective.\n\nDONE."

Each widget should be identical, but the inspector found 8 widgets with the following weights in grams: 145, 146, 145, 146, 145, 146, 159, 145. The question is asking which widget is most likely defective and what pattern in the data leads to that conclusion.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the problem. All widgets should be identical, meaning their weights should be the same. However, there are slight variations in weight, and one of these widgets is defective. The defective one is likely to stand out because its weight is either too high or too low compared to the others. So, I need to figure out which one is the odd one out.\n\nLooking at the data: 145, 146, 145, 146, 145, 146, 159, 145.\n\nI notice that most of the weights are either 145 or 146 grams. These are very close to each other, which suggests that these are the correct weights for a good widget. The odd one out is 159 grams, which is significantly higher than the others. So, my initial thought is that 159 grams is the defective widget because it's too heavy compared to the rest.\n\nBut wait, I should double-check to make sure I'm not missing something. Maybe there's another pattern or a different way to interpret the data. Let's list them again: 145, 146, 145, 146, 145, 146, 159, 145.\n\nCounting how many times each weight appears:\n\n- 145 grams: Let's see, first one is 145, third is 145, fifth is 145, seventh is 145, and the eighth is 145. That's five times.\n\n- 146 grams: Second is 146, fourth is 146, sixth is 146. That's three times.\n\n- 159 grams: That's once.\n\nSo, 145 appears five times, 146 appears three times, and 159 appears once.\n\nSince 159 is the only one that appears once, it's likely the defective one because all the others are within a very tight range, indicating they're good. The defective widget is the one that doesn't fit this range.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to consider the average weight or the median. Calculating the average might not be necessary here because the difference is so obvious, but just for thoroughness:\n\nLet's add them up: 145 + 146 + 145 + 146 + 145 + 146 + 159 + 145.\n\nCalculating step by step:\n\n145 + 146 = 291\n\n291 + 145 = 436\n\n436 + 146 = 582\n\n582 + 145 = 727\n\n727 + 146 = 873\n\n873 + 159 = 1032\n\n1032 + 145 = 1177\n\nTotal sum is 1177 grams.\n\nAverage weight is total sum divided by the number of widgets, which is 8.\n\n1177 / 8 = 147.125 grams.\n\nSo, the average is around 147 grams. Most of the widgets are either 145 or 146, which are close to the average, and then there's 159, which is way above average. This reinforces the idea that 159 is the defective widget.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about the distribution of the weights, the 159 is a clear outlier. In statistics, an outlier is a data point that is significantly different from the rest. Here, 159 is not just slightly different; it's almost 14 grams higher than the next highest weight, which is 146.\n\nI should also consider if there's any possibility that 145 could be the defective one, but that seems unlikely because there are five 145s, which is the majority. If 145 was defective, I would expect fewer of them, not more. Similarly, 146 appears three times, which is still less than five, so it's not the majority either.\n\nAnother angle is to see if there's a pattern in the order of the weights. The sequence is: 145, 146, 145, 146, 145, 146, 159, 145.\n\nLooking at this sequence, it alternates between 145 and 146, except for the seventh one, which is 159, and the eighth one, which is back to 145. So, the seventh widget is the one that breaks the pattern by being much higher. That's another clue that it's defective.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the data, the defective widget is the one weighing 159 grams. This is evident because it's the only weight that doesn't fit the established pattern of alternating between 145 and 146 grams. The high value of 159 grams stands out as the anomaly, indicating a potential defect.\n</think>\n\nThe defective widget is the one weighing 159 grams. The pattern in the data shows that most weights alternate between 145 and 146 grams, with 159 being the outlier. \n\nDONE."

End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: A quality control inspector at a factory receives boxes of widgets that should all be identical. The inspector examines 8 widgets and records their weights in grams: 145, 146, 145, 146, 145, 146, 159, 145. Based on this data, which widget is most likely defective, and what pattern in the data leads to this conclusion? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out which widget is most likely defective based on the weights recorded by the inspector. Let's see, the weights are: 145, 146, 145, 146, 145, 146, 159, 145. Hmm, okay. \n\nFirst, I think I should look for any outliers because defective widgets might have different weights. The majority of the weights are around 145 grams, but I notice that one widget is significantly heavier at 159 grams. That seems way off compared to the others. \n\nLet me count how many widgets are around each weight. The 145s: there are five of them. The 146s: two of them. And then there's the 159, which is just one. So, the 145s are the most common, and the 159 is the odd one out. \n\nMaybe the defective one is the 159 because it's too heavy. But I should double-check if there's any other pattern or reason why 159 could be defective. Is there a reason why a widget would be heavier? Maybe it's a manufacturing defect or something went wrong during production. \n\nAlso, I'm wondering if the inspector made a mistake in measuring that 159. But since it's the only one that stands out, I think it's more likely that the widget itself is defective. \n\nSo, based on the data, the widget that weighs 159 grams is the most likely defective because it's the only one significantly different from the rest. The pattern here is that most widgets are within a tight range, and one is way outside, indicating a possible defect.\n</think>\n\nThe most likely defective widget is the one weighing 159 grams. This is evident because it stands out as an outlier compared to the other weights, which are clustered around 145-146 grams. The pattern indicates a significant deviation from the norm, suggesting a possible defect.\n\nDONE."
