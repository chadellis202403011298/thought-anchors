  "question": "A researcher wants to test whether a new fertilizer increases tomato plant growth compared to a standard fertilizer. She selects 30 tomato seedlings of the same variety and randomly assigns 15 to receive the new fertilizer and 15 to receive the standard fertilizer. After 4 weeks, she measures the height (in cm) of each plant. The plants with the new fertilizer have a mean height of 28.5 cm with a standard deviation of 3.2 cm, while the plants with the standard fertilizer have a mean height of 25.7 cm with a standard deviation of 3.5 cm.\n\nFormulate appropriate null and alternative hypotheses for this experiment. Then, based on the data provided, would you reject the null hypothesis at a significance level of 0.05? Explain your reasoning step by step.",
  "answer": "Step 1: Formulate the hypotheses.\nThe null hypothesis (H\u2080) states that there is no effect of the new fertilizer compared to the standard one:\nH\u2080: \u03bc\u2081 = \u03bc\u2082 (The mean plant heights for the new and standard fertilizers are equal)\n\nThe alternative hypothesis (H\u2081) states that the new fertilizer increases plant growth:\nH\u2081: \u03bc\u2081 > \u03bc\u2082 (The mean plant height for the new fertilizer is greater than for the standard fertilizer)\n\nStep 2: Calculate the test statistic (t-value).\nFirst, we need to calculate the pooled standard error:\n\nSE = \u221a[(s\u2081\u00b2/n\u2081) + (s\u2082\u00b2/n\u2082)]\nSE = \u221a[(3.2\u00b2/15) + (3.5\u00b2/15)]\nSE = \u221a[(10.24/15) + (12.25/15)]\nSE = \u221a[0.683 + 0.817]\nSE = \u221a1.5\nSE = 1.225\n\nNow calculate the t-statistic:\nt = (x\u0304\u2081 - x\u0304\u2082) / SE\nt = (28.5 - 25.7) / 1.225\nt = 2.8 / 1.225\nt = 2.286\n\nStep 3: Determine the critical value.\nFor a one-tailed test with \u03b1 = 0.05 and df = n\u2081 + n\u2082 - 2 = 15 + 15 - 2 = 28, the critical t-value is approximately 1.701.\n\nStep 4: Make a decision.\nSince our calculated t-value (2.286) is greater than the critical value (1.701), we reject the null hypothesis.\n\nStep 5: State the conclusion.\nThere is statistically significant evidence at the 0.05 level to conclude that the new fertilizer increases tomato plant growth compared to the standard fertilizer. The observed difference in mean heights (28.5 cm vs 25.7 cm) is unlikely to have occurred by chance alone if the fertilizers were equally effective."
