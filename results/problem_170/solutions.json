Hmm, okay, I remember that binomial coefficients have something to do with combinations, right? So, (n choose k) is the number of ways to choose k elements from a set of n elements. But how does that relate to the sum of all these combinations?\n\nLet me think. The problem mentions using a combinatorial argument based on counting subsets. Oh, right! A set with n elements has 2^n subsets because each element can either be included or excluded. So, for each element, there are two choices, leading to 2 multiplied by itself n times, which is 2^n.\n\nBut wait, how does the sum of binomial coefficients come into play here? Maybe I can think about the total number of subsets as the sum of all subsets of different sizes. So, the number of subsets with 0 elements, plus the number with 1 element, all the way up to subsets with n elements. That makes sense because every subset has a specific size from 0 to n.\n\nSo, if I add up all the subsets of each size, that should give me the total number of subsets, which is 2^n. In mathematical terms, that's the sum from k=0 to n of (n choose k) equals 2^n. That seems to line up with what I'm trying to prove.\n\nBut let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Is there another way to approach this? Maybe using generating functions or some algebraic identity? But the problem specifically asks for a combinatorial argument, so I should stick with the subset counting idea.\n\nLet me also recall that the binomial theorem relates the sum of binomial coefficients to 2^n. The binomial theorem says that (1 + 1)^n equals the sum from k=0 to n of (n choose k). Since (1 + 1) is 2, that gives 2^n equals the sum, which is exactly what we're trying to prove.\n\nWait, but isn't that just a restatement of the problem? The problem is asking to prove the identity, so maybe I should frame it more in terms of subsets rather than algebraically.\n\nOkay, let's try to structure this. First, consider a set with n elements. The total number of subsets is 2^n because each element has two choices: included or not. Now, these subsets can be categorized by their size. The number of subsets of size k is (n choose k). So, if I add up all the subsets of each possible size from 0 to n, I should get the total number of subsets, which is 2^n.\n\nTherefore, the sum from k=0 to n of (n choose k) equals 2^n. That's exactly the identity we're trying to prove. This makes sense because we're just counting all possible subsets by considering each size separately and then adding them up.\n\nI think that covers it. The combinatorial argument is about counting all subsets by summing the number of subsets of each size, which gives the total number of subsets, 2^n. So, the identity holds because both sides count the same thing in different ways.\n</think>\n\nTo prove the identity \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} = 2^n\\) using a combinatorial argument, consider a set \\(S\\) with \\(n\\) elements. Each element can either be included or excluded from a subset, resulting in \\(2^n\\) possible subsets in total.\n\nNow, let's categorize these subsets by their size. The number of subsets of size \\(k\\) is given by the binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\). Therefore, the total number of subsets is the sum of subsets of all possible sizes from \\(0\\) to \\(n\\):\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k}\n\\]\n\nSince this sum counts all possible subsets, it must equal the total number of subsets, which is \\(2^n\\). Thus, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} = 2^n\n\\]\n\n**DONE.**"

Hmm, I remember that binomial coefficients are related to combinations, like choosing k elements from a set of n. But how does that help me here?\n\nMaybe I should start by recalling what the binomial coefficient actually represents. The term \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) is the number of ways to choose k elements from a set of n elements. So, when I sum \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) from k=0 to n, I'm essentially adding up all the ways to choose 0 elements, 1 element, up to n elements from the set.\n\nWait, but how does that relate to 2^n? Oh, right! 2^n is the total number of subsets a set with n elements can have, including the empty set and the set itself. So, if I can show that the sum of all these combinations equals the total number of subsets, that would make sense.\n\nLet me think about a specific example to visualize this. Suppose n=2. Then, the set has 2 elements, say {a, b}. The subsets are: {}, {a}, {b}, and {a, b}. So, that's 4 subsets, which is 2^2. Now, the binomial coefficients would be \\(\\binom{2}{0}=1\\), \\(\\binom{2}{1}=2\\), and \\(\\binom{2}{2}=1\\). Adding those up: 1 + 2 + 1 = 4, which equals 2^2. Okay, that checks out for n=2.\n\nLet me try another example, maybe n=3. The set {a, b, c} has 8 subsets, which is 2^3. The binomial coefficients are \\(\\binom{3}{0}=1\\), \\(\\binom{3}{1}=3\\), \\(\\binom{3}{2}=3\\), and \\(\\binom{3}{3}=1\\). Adding those: 1 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 8. Yep, that works too.\n\nSo, this seems to hold for small n. But how to generalize this? Maybe I can think about each element in the set and decide whether to include it or not in a subset. For each element, there are two choices: include it or exclude it. Since there are n elements, the total number of possible combinations is 2 multiplied by itself n times, which is 2^n.\n\nBut how does that relate to the sum of binomial coefficients? Well, each binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) counts the number of subsets with exactly k elements. So, when I sum all \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) from k=0 to n, I'm counting all possible subsets, regardless of their size. That should give me the total number of subsets, which is 2^n.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think again. Each element has two choices, so the total number of subsets is indeed 2^n. And the sum of the binomial coefficients counts all subsets, so they must be equal. That makes sense.\n\nI guess another way to see it is through the binomial theorem. The sum of the binomial coefficients is the same as expanding (1 + 1)^n, which equals 2^n. But isn't that a more algebraic approach rather than a combinatorial one? The question specifically asks for a combinatorial argument, so maybe I should stick to the counting subsets idea.\n\nSo, to wrap it up: the sum of binomial coefficients from k=0 to n counts all possible subsets of a set with n elements, and since there are 2^n subsets, the identity holds.\n</think>\n\nThe identity \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} = 2^n\\) can be proven by considering all possible subsets of a set with \\(n\\) elements. Each subset corresponds to a unique combination of elements, and the number of subsets of size \\(k\\) is given by \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\). Summing these counts over all possible \\(k\\) from 0 to \\(n\\) gives the total number of subsets, which is \\(2^n\\). Therefore, the identity holds as both sides equal the total number of subsets.\n\nDONE."

Hmm, I remember that binomial coefficients are related to combinations, like the number of ways to choose k elements from a set of n elements.

That's because for each element, it can either be in a subset or not, giving two choices. So, for n elements, it's 2 multiplied by itself n times, which is 2^n.\n\nNow, the left side of the equation is the sum of binomial coefficients from k=0 to n. The binomial coefficient (n choose k) counts the number of subsets with exactly k elements. So, if I sum all these from k=0 to k=n, I'm essentially counting all possible subsets, regardless of their size. That should give me the total number of subsets, which I know is 2^n.\n\nLet me make sure I'm not missing anything. For each k, (n choose k) is the number of k-element subsets. So adding them up from k=0 to k=n should cover all possible subset sizes: from the empty set (which has 0 elements) to the entire set itself (which has n elements). Since each subset must have a specific size, adding all these counts together should give the total number of subsets.\n\nWait, is there another way to think about this? Maybe using the binomial theorem? The binomial theorem states that (a + b)^n equals the sum from k=0 to n of (n choose k) * a^(n-k) * b^k. If I set a = 1 and b = 1, then (1 + 1)^n equals the sum from k=0 to n of (n choose k) * 1^(n-k) * 1^k, which simplifies to 2^n equals the sum from k=0 to n of (n choose k). So that also gives the same result. But the question asks for a combinatorial argument, not an algebraic one, so I should stick with the subset counting.\n\nSo, to summarize, the sum of binomial coefficients from k=0 to n counts all subsets of an n-element set, each subset being counted exactly once according to its size. Since the total number of subsets is 2^n, the sum must equal 2^n.\n\nI think that makes sense. I don't see any flaws in this reasoning. It all ties together neatly with the fundamental concept of counting subsets.\n</think>\n\nTo prove the identity \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} = 2^n\\) using a combinatorial argument, consider the set \\(S\\) with \\(n\\) elements. Each element has two possibilities: it can either be included in a subset or not. Therefore, the total number of subsets of \\(S\\) is \\(2^n\\).\n\nThe binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) represents the number of subsets of \\(S\\) that contain exactly \\(k\\) elements. By summing \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) for all \\(k\\) from 0 to \\(n\\), we are effectively counting all possible subsets of \\(S\\), regardless of their size. Since this sum accounts for every subset exactly once, it must equal the total number of subsets, which is \\(2^n\\).\n\n**DONE.**"

So, the sum from \\(k=0\\) to \\(n\\) of these coefficients should give me the total number of subsets possible for that set.\n\nLet me think about it step by step. If I have a set \\(S\\) with \\(n\\) elements, how many subsets does it have? Well, for each element in the set, it can either be included or excluded from a subset. So, for each element, there are 2 choices. Since the choices are independent, the total number of subsets should be \\(2 \\times 2 \\times \\dots \\times 2\\) (with \\(n\\) twos). That's \\(2^n\\) subsets in total.\n\nNow, let's consider how the binomial coefficients add up to this total. The term \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) counts the number of subsets with exactly \\(k\\) elements. So, when I sum \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) from \\(k=0\\) to \\(k=n\\), I'm essentially counting all possible subset sizes, from the empty set (which has 0 elements) to the entire set itself (which has \\(n\\) elements).\n\nTo make it clearer, let me break it down. The number of subsets with 0 elements is 1 (just the empty set). The number of subsets with 1 element is \\(n\\), since there are \\(n\\) elements to choose from. Similarly, the number of subsets with 2 elements is \\(\\binom{n}{2}\\), and this pattern continues up to subsets with \\(n\\) elements, which is 1 (just the entire set).\n\nSo, adding all these up: \\(1 + n + \\binom{n}{2} + \\dots + \\binom{n}{n}\\). But I also know that this sum equals \\(2^n\\), as each element can be either included or excluded independently.\n\nWait, maybe I can think about it another way. Suppose I list all the subsets. Each subset can be uniquely identified by its elements. For each element, there are two choices: in or out. Since there are \\(n\\) elements, the total number of possible combinations is \\(2^n\\). This makes sense because each subset is a unique combination of these choices.\n\nSo, when I sum \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) from \\(k=0\\) to \\(n\\), I'm counting all possible combinations of inclusions and exclusions, which is exactly \\(2^n\\).\n\nI think I have the connection now. The combinatorial argument relies on understanding that each element contributes a factor of 2 to the total number of subsets, and the binomial coefficients sum up all these possibilities for different subset sizes.\n</think>\n\nThe sum \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k}\\) represents the total number of subsets of a set with \\(n\\) elements.

Hmm, okay, let me think about how subsets relate to binomial coefficients.\n\nFirst, I remember that the binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) represents the number of ways to choose k elements from a set of n elements. So, if I sum this from k=0 to k=n, I'm essentially summing the number of subsets of all possible sizes in the set. That would include the empty set (when k=0), all single-element subsets, all two-element subsets, and so on, up to the entire set itself (when k=n).\n\nWait, so the sum \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k}\\) is the total number of subsets of a set with n elements. I also recall that for any set with n elements, the number of subsets is 2^n. That makes sense because each element has two choices: either to be included in a subset or not. Therefore, for n elements, there are 2 multiplied by itself n times, which is 2^n subsets.\n\nBut let me make sure I'm not missing something. Is the empty set considered a subset? Yes, it is. So when k=0, \\(\\binom{n}{0}\\) is 1, which counts the empty set. Then, each subsequent term adds the subsets of size 1, 2, ..., up to n. So adding all these together should give the total number of subsets, which is 2^n.\n\nLet me think of a small example to verify this. Suppose n=2. The set has elements {a, b}. The subsets are: {}, {a}, {b}, and {a, b}. So that's 4 subsets, which is 2^2=4. Let's compute the sum: \\(\\binom{2}{0} + \\binom{2}{1} + \\binom{2}{2} = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4\\). Yep, that checks out.\n\nAnother example: n=3. The set {a, b, c} has subsets: {}, {a}, {b}, {c}, {a, b}, {a, c}, {b, c}, {a, b, c}. That's 8 subsets, which is 2^3=8. Calculating the sum: 1 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 8. Perfect, it works again.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the combinatorial argument is that each subset corresponds uniquely to a choice of elements, and each such choice is counted by the binomial coefficient. Summing over all k from 0 to n gives the total number of subsets, which is 2^n. Therefore, the identity holds.\n</think>\n\nTo prove the identity \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} = 2^n\\) using a combinatorial argument, consider the set \\(S\\) with \\(n\\) distinct elements. The number of subsets of \\(S\\) can be calculated by considering all possible choices of elements from the set. \n\nFor each element in \\(S\\), there are two choices: either the element is included in a subset or it is not. Therefore, the total number of subsets is \\(2^n\\).\n\nOn the other hand, the sum \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k}\\) counts the number of subsets of each possible size \\(k\\), from 0 to \\(n\\). This includes the empty set (when \\(k=0\\)) and all subsets of size 1, 2, ..., up to \\(n\\). Since every subset of \\(S\\) is uniquely determined by its size \\(k\\), the total number of subsets is exactly the sum of the binomial coefficients.\n\nThus, \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k}\\) must equal the total number of subsets, which is \\(2^n\\). Therefore, the identity is proven.\n\n**DONE.**"

Then the set \\(S = \\{a, b\\}\\). The subsets are:\n\n- Size 0: {} (empty set)\n- Size 1: {a}, {b}\n- Size 2: {a, b}\n\nSo, the number of subsets is 4, which is \\(2^2\\).

In other words, I need to show that the sum of all the subsets of an n-element set is equal to 2^n. Hmm, okay, let's start by recalling what binomial coefficients represent.\n\nI remember that the binomial coefficient, written as C(n, k) or \"n choose k,\" represents the number of ways to choose k elements from a set of n elements without considering the order. So, when we sum C(n, k) from k = 0 to n, we're essentially adding up all the possible ways to choose any number of elements from the set, including choosing none or all of them.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, if I have a set with n elements, the number of subsets it has should be 2^n because each element has two choices: either being in a subset or not. Therefore, for each element, there are 2 options, and since the choices are independent, the total number of subsets is 2 multiplied by itself n times, which is 2^n.\n\nBut let me think deeper about how this relates to the sum of binomial coefficients. If I list out all the subsets, each subset corresponds to a unique combination of elements. The number of subsets with exactly k elements is C(n, k), so when I sum C(n, k) for all k from 0 to n, I'm counting every possible subset, regardless of its size. Therefore, the sum should give me the total number of subsets, which is 2^n.\n\nLet me try to formalize this a bit. Consider a set S with n elements. The total number of subsets of S is 2^n because each element can be either included or excluded from a subset. Now, let's consider how many subsets have exactly k elements. This number is given by the binomial coefficient C(n, k). \n\nTherefore, if I add up C(n, k) for all k from 0 to n, I'm adding up the number of subsets of all possible sizes. That is, I'm counting all subsets, from the empty set (which has 0 elements) to the entire set itself (which has n elements). Since every subset is counted exactly once in this sum, the total number of subsets is indeed the sum of C(n, k) from k=0 to n.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the sum of the binomial coefficients C(n, k) for k from 0 to n equals 2^n because each term C(n, k) counts the subsets of size k, and the total number of subsets is 2^n.\n\nI think that makes sense. Maybe I can test it with a small example to make sure. Let's take n=2. The set S = {a, b}. The subsets are: {}, {a}, {b}, and {a, b}. So, that's 4 subsets, which is 2^2. Now, the binomial coefficients are C(2,0)=1, C(2,1)=2, and C(2,2)=1. Adding them up: 1+2+1=4, which equals 2^2. That checks out.\n\nAnother example: n=3. The set S = {a, b, c}. The subsets are: {}, {a}, {b}, {c}, {a, b}, {a, c}, {b, c}, {a, b, c}. That's 8 subsets, which is 2^3. The binomial coefficients are C(3,0)=1, C(3,1)=3, C(3,2)=3, and C(3,3)=1. Adding them up: 1+3+3+1=8, which again equals 2^3. Okay, so the pattern holds for these examples.\n\nTherefore, I can confidently say that the sum of the binomial coefficients from k=0 to n is indeed equal to 2^n because this sum counts all possible subsets of an n-element set, and there are 2^n subsets in total.\n</think>\n\nTo prove the identity using a combinatorial argument, consider a set S with n elements.

End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: Prove the following identity using a combinatorial argument: \\[ \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} = 2^n \\] Provide a clear explanation based on counting the subsets of a set with n elements. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this problem here that I need to prove the identity \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} = 2^n\\) using a combinatorial argument by counting the subsets of a set with \\(n\\) elements. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step. I'm a bit new to combinatorics, so I need to take it slow and make sure I understand each part.\n\nFirst off, I remember that \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) represents the number of ways to choose \\(k\\) elements from a set of \\(n\\) elements. So, \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) is the binomial coefficient, also known as \"n choose k.\" The sum \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k}\\) is adding up all these combinations for every possible \\(k\\) from 0 to \\(n\\). On the other side of the equation, we have \\(2^n\\), which is the number of subsets of a set with \\(n\\) elements because each element has two choices: either being in a subset or not.\n\nSo, the problem is essentially asking me to show that if I add up all the ways to choose subsets of size 0, 1, 2, ..., up to \\(n\\), that total is equal to the number of all possible subsets. That makes sense because each element can independently be included or excluded, leading to \\(2^n\\) subsets in total.\n\nLet me think about how subsets are formed. For each element in the set, there are two possibilities: it's either in a subset or not. So, for each of the \\(n\\) elements, there are 2 choices. That would mean the total number of subsets is \\(2 \\times 2 \\times \\dots \\times 2\\) (n times), which is \\(2^n\\). That seems straightforward, but I need to connect this to the sum of binomial coefficients.\n\nMaybe I should consider each subset and categorize them based on their size. So, subsets can be categorized by how many elements they contain: 0 elements, 1 element, 2 elements, and so on, up to \\(n\\) elements. The number of subsets with exactly \\(k\\) elements is \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\), so if I add all these up for every \\(k\\) from 0 to \\(n\\), I should get the total number of subsets, which is \\(2^n\\).\n\nWait, so the left side of the equation is the total number of subsets when I consider all possible sizes, and the right side is the total number of subsets when considering each element's independent inclusion. So, they should be equal because both represent the total number of subsets.\n\nLet me try with a small example to see if this holds. Let's take \\(n = 2\\). Then, the subsets are:\n\n- Size 0: {} (1 subset)\n- Size 1: {a}, {b} (2 subsets)\n- Size 2: {a, b} (1 subset)\n\nSo, the total number of subsets is \\(1 + 2 + 1 = 4\\), which is \\(2^2 = 4\\). Now, using the sum of binomial coefficients:\n\n\\(\\binom{2}{0} + \\binom{2}{1} + \\binom{2}{2} = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4\\), which matches. Okay, that works for \\(n = 2\\).\n\nLet me try \\(n = 3\\) to be sure.\n\nSubsets:\n\n- Size 0: {} (1)\n- Size 1: {a}, {b}, {c} (3)\n- Size 2: {a, b}, {a, c}, {b, c} (3)\n- Size 3: {a, b, c} (1)\n\nTotal subsets: \\(1 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 8\\), which is \\(2^3 = 8\\). Now, the sum of binomial coefficients:\n\n\\(\\binom{3}{0} + \\binom{3}{1} + \\binom{3}{2} + \\binom{3}{3} = 1 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 8\\). Perfect, that matches too.\n\nSo, it seems like this identity holds for small values of \\(n\\). But I need to generalize this into a proof.\n\nI think the key here is to realize that each subset can be uniquely identified by the number of elements it contains, which is \\(k\\), and that the number of subsets with exactly \\(k\\) elements is \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\). Therefore, summing over all possible \\(k\\) from 0 to \\(n\\) gives the total number of subsets, which is \\(2^n\\).\n\nAnother way to think about it is by considering the principle of inclusion-exclusion. For each element, we have two choices, so the total number of possible combinations is \\(2^n\\). Alternatively, since the subsets can be partitioned into those with \\(k\\) elements for each \\(k\\), and each partition has \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) subsets, adding them up must give the total number of subsets.\n\nWait, maybe I can visualize this. Imagine a set with \\(n\\) elements. For each element, I can represent its inclusion in a subset as a binary choice: 1 if it's included, 0 if it's not. Since each element has two choices independently, the total number of combinations is \\(2^n\\). But each subset corresponds uniquely to a binary string of length \\(n\\), where each position indicates the presence (1) or absence (0) of the corresponding element in the subset.\n\nNow, if I count the number of subsets with exactly \\(k\\) elements, it's equivalent to counting the number of binary strings with exactly \\(k\\) ones. The number of such strings is \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\), which is exactly the number of subsets of size \\(k\\). Therefore, summing over all \\(k\\) from 0 to \\(n\\) gives the total number of subsets, which is \\(2^n\\).\n\nI think this makes sense. Each subset is uniquely determined by the number of elements it contains, and each count of subsets of a particular size is given by the binomial coefficient. So, adding them all up should give the total number of subsets, which is \\(2^n\\).\n\nLet me see if I can formalize this a bit more. Consider the set \\(S = \\{1, 2, 3, \\dots, n\\}\\). A subset \\(A\\) of \\(S\\) can be represented by a characteristic function \\(f: S \\rightarrow \\{0, 1\\}\\), where \\(f(i) = 1\\) if \\(i \\in A\\) and \\(f(i) = 0\\) otherwise. The number of such functions is \\(2^n\\), which is the total number of subsets.\n\nNow, let's fix a particular \\(k\\) between 0 and \\(n\\). The number of subsets where exactly \\(k\\) elements are included is equal to the number of ways to choose \\(k\\) elements out of \\(n\\), which is \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\). Therefore, summing over all \\(k\\) gives the total number of subsets:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} = 2^n\n\\]\n\nYes, that seems like a solid argument. Each subset is counted exactly once in the sum, categorized by its size, and each term in the sum corresponds to the number of subsets of that size. Therefore, the total must equal the overall number of subsets, which is \\(2^n\\).\n\nI think I've got it now. The combinatorial argument relies on understanding that each subset can be counted by its size, and the number of subsets of each size is given by the binomial coefficients. Summing these gives the total number of subsets, which is \\(2^n\\).\n</think>\n\nThe identity \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} = 2^n\\) can be proven by considering the subsets of a set with \\(n\\) elements. Each subset can be uniquely identified by the number of elements it contains, which ranges from 0 to \\(n\\). The number of subsets with exactly \\(k\\) elements is \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\). Summing these binomial coefficients for all possible \\(k\\) gives the total number of subsets, which is \\(2^n\\) because each element has two independent choices (inclusion or exclusion) in a subset.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation and Proof:**\n\n1. **Understand the Binomial Coefficient:**\n   - \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) represents the number of ways to choose \\(k\\) elements from a set of \\(n\\) elements.\n\n2. **Total Number of Subsets:**\n   - A set with \\(n\\) elements has \\(2^n\\) subsets because each element can either be included or excluded from a subset, leading to \\(2\\) choices per element.\n\n3. **Counting Subsets by Size:**\n   - Subsets can be categorized by their size \\(k\\), where \\(k\\) ranges from 0 to \\(n\\).\n   - The number of subsets of size \\(k\\) is \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\).\n\n4. **Summing Over All Subset Sizes:**\n   - Summing the number of subsets of each size from 0 to \\(n\\) gives the total number of subsets:\n     \\[\n     \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Equating to Total Subsets:**\n   - Since the total number of subsets is \\(2^n\\), we have:\n     \\[\n     \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} = 2^n\n     \\]\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Therefore, the sum of binomial coefficients from \\(k=0\\) to \\(k=n\\) equals \\(2^n\\), as both represent the total number of subsets of a set with \\(n\\) elements.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} = 2^n\n\\]\n\nThis identity holds because the sum of the number of subsets of all possible sizes (from 0 to \\(n\\)) in a set with \\(n\\) elements equals the total number of subsets, which is \\(2^n\\). Each subset is uniquely identified by its size, and the number of subsets of each size is given by the binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\). Summing these coefficients for all \\(k\\) from 0 to \\(n\\) yields the total number of subsets, confirming the identity.\n\nDONE."

Hmm, okay, let's think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the binomial coefficient, \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\), represents the number of ways to choose k elements from a set of n elements. So, the sum \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k}\\) is adding up all the possible ways to choose any number of elements from the set, right? That includes choosing none of them, which is \\(\\binom{n}{0}\\), and choosing all of them, which is \\(\\binom{n}{n}\\), and everything in between.\n\nWait, so if I have a set with n elements, how many subsets does it have in total? I think it's 2^n because each element has two choices: either being included in a subset or not. So, for each of the n elements, there are 2 options, and since they're independent, it's 2 multiplied by itself n times, which is 2^n.\n\nBut hold on, how does this relate to the sum of the binomial coefficients? Let me try to connect these two ideas. The sum \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k}\\) is essentially counting all possible subsets of the set with n elements because each term \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) corresponds to the number of subsets with exactly k elements. So, adding them all up gives the total number of subsets, which should be 2^n.\n\nLet me double-check this reasoning. Suppose I have a set with 2 elements, say {a, b}. The subsets are: {}, {a}, {b}, and {a, b}. That's 4 subsets, which is 2^2. Now, using the binomial coefficients: \\(\\binom{2}{0} + \\binom{2}{1} + \\binom{2}{2} = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4\\), which matches. So, it works for n=2.\n\nAnother example: n=3. The set {a, b, c} has 8 subsets, which is 2^3. Using the sum: \\(\\binom{3}{0} + \\binom{3}{1} + \\binom{3}{2} + \\binom{3}{3} = 1 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 8\\). Yep, that checks out too.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the sum of the binomial coefficients from k=0 to n counts all possible subsets of an n-element set, and since each element can be either included or excluded, the total number of subsets is 2^n. Therefore, the identity holds.\n\nI think that's a solid reasoning. I don't see any flaws in this combinatorial argument. It directly connects the sum of binomial coefficients to the total number of subsets, which is a well-known fact.\n</think>\n\nTo prove the identity \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} = 2^n\\) using a combinatorial argument, consider the following:\n\n1. **Understanding Binomial Coefficients**: Each term \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) represents the number of ways to choose \\(k\\) elements from a set of \\(n\\) elements.\n\n2. **Summing All Subsets**: The sum \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k}\\) adds up the number of subsets of all possible sizes, from the empty set (when \\(k=0\\)) to the set itself (when \\(k=n\\)).\n\n3. **Total Number of Subsets**: For a set with \\(n\\) elements, each element has two choices: being included or excluded from a subset. Therefore, the total number of subsets is \\(2^n\\).\n\n4. **Equating the Two Expressions**: Since the sum of the binomial coefficients counts all subsets and the total number of subsets is \\(2^n\\), it follows that \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} = 2^n\\).\n\n**Conclusion**: The identity is proven by recognizing that the sum of the binomial coefficients counts all subsets of an \\(n\\)-element set, which totals \\(2^n\\).\n\nDONE."

Hmm, I remember that binomial coefficients are related to combinations, like the number of ways to choose k elements from a set of n elements. But how does that relate to the sum being 2^n?\n\nOkay, the problem suggests using a combinatorial argument based on counting the subsets of a set with n elements. I think that makes sense because I remember that the total number of subsets of a set with n elements is 2^n. Each element can either be included or excluded from a subset, leading to 2 choices per element, hence 2 multiplied by itself n times.\n\nSo, if I consider all the subsets of an n-element set, there are 2^n of them. Now, the binomial coefficient (n choose k) counts how many subsets have exactly k elements. So, if I sum (n choose k) from k=0 to n, I'm essentially counting all possible subset sizes, from the empty set (which has 0 elements) to the entire set itself (which has n elements).\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nSum from k=0 to n of (n choose k) = total number of subsets = 2^n.\n\nWait, is that it? It seems straightforward, but maybe I should elaborate more to make sure I'm not missing anything.\n\nLet's think about it step by step. For each element in the set, there are two choices: include it in a subset or not. So, for n elements, the number of possible subsets is 2 * 2 * ... * 2 (n times) = 2^n.\n\nOn the other hand, the sum of the binomial coefficients counts all subsets by their sizes. Each term (n choose k) counts how many subsets have exactly k elements. Adding them up from k=0 to k=n gives the total number of subsets, which we know is 2^n.\n\nIs there another way to think about this? Maybe using binary representations. Each subset can be represented by a binary string of length n, where each bit indicates the presence (1) or absence (0) of the corresponding element. There are 2^n such binary strings, which correspond to 2^n subsets. Each of these binary strings has exactly n bits, and the number of 1s in each string corresponds to the size of the subset it represents. So, the total number of subsets is the same as the sum of the number of subsets of each possible size, which is the sum of (n choose k) from k=0 to n.\n\nI think that solidifies the connection. Both approaches\u2014the combinatorial counting and the binary string representation\u2014lead to the conclusion that the sum of the binomial coefficients equals 2^n.\n\nMaybe I should also consider a small example to test this. Let's take n=2.\n\nFor n=2, the subsets are:\n- 0 elements: {}\n- 1 element: {1}, {2}\n- 2 elements: {1,2}\n\nSo, the number of subsets is 4, which is 2^2. Now, the sum of the binomial coefficients would be (2 choose 0) + (2 choose 1) + (2 choose 2) = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4, which matches 2^2.\n\nAnother example: n=3.\n\nSubsets:\n- 0 elements: {}\n- 1 element: {1}, {2}, {3}\n- 2 elements: {1,2}, {1,3}, {2,3}\n- 3 elements: {1,2,3}\n\nTotal subsets: 8, which is 2^3. Sum of binomial coefficients: (3 choose 0) + (3 choose 1) + (3 choose 2) + (3 choose 3) = 1 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 8.\n\nThis seems to hold true for these small cases, which gives me more confidence in the general proof.\n\nI think I've got it. The key idea is that the sum of the binomial coefficients counts all possible subsets of an n-element set, which is exactly 2^n. So, the combinatorial argument is essentially showing that both sides count the same thing in different ways.\n</think>\n\nTo prove the identity \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} = 2^n\\) using a combinatorial argument, consider the set of all subsets of an \\(n\\)-element set. Each element can either be included or excluded from a subset, resulting in \\(2^n\\) possible subsets in total.\n\nThe binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{n}{k}\\) counts the number of subsets with exactly \\(k\\) elements.
