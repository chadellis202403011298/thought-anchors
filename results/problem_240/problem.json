  "question": "A wooden cube measuring 3\u00d73\u00d73 centimeters is painted red on all six faces. It is then cut into 27 identical 1\u00d71\u00d71 centimeter cubes. How many of these small cubes have exactly two faces painted red?",
  "answer": "To solve this problem, I need to visualize the original 3\u00d73\u00d73 cube after it has been painted and then cut into smaller cubes.\n\nFirst, I'll identify the different types of small cubes based on how many faces are painted:\n1. Corner cubes: These have three painted faces (8 total corner cubes)\n2. Edge cubes: These have two painted faces (located along the 12 edges, but not at corners)\n3. Face-center cubes: These have one painted face (located at the center of each face)\n4. Interior cubes: These have zero painted faces (completely inside the cube)\n\nTo find how many small cubes have exactly two faces painted red, I need to count the edge cubes.\n\nOn a 3\u00d73\u00d73 cube:\n- Each edge contains 3 small cubes\n- The corner cubes are counted separately\n- So each edge has 3 - 2 = 1 edge cube (excluding the corners)\n- There are 12 edges in a cube\n\nTherefore, there are 12 small cubes with exactly two faces painted red."
