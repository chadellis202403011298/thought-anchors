  "question": "A furniture designer has developed a successful bookshelf that adjusts its shelves automatically based on the height of the books placed on it. The company now wants to apply similar innovative thinking to a new product line. Which of the following products would most effectively utilize analogical transfer from the bookshelf concept?\n\nA) A desk with drawers that open when you wave your hand over them\nB) A kitchen cabinet that reorganizes its shelves based on the height of stored items\nC) A chair that changes color based on room temperature\nD) A table with built-in wireless charging for devices",
  "answer": "The correct answer is B) A kitchen cabinet that reorganizes its shelves based on the height of stored items.\n\nStep 1: Identify the core principle from the original solution (the bookshelf).\nThe key innovation in the bookshelf is that it adapts its physical configuration (shelf spacing) in response to the physical dimensions (height) of the items being stored.\n\nStep 2: Consider each potential new application to determine if it follows the same underlying principle.\n\nOption A (drawers opening with hand wave) involves motion activation but doesn't relate to adapting to the dimensions of stored items.\n\nOption B (kitchen cabinet reorganizing shelves based on item height) directly applies the same principle: adapting the physical storage space based on the dimensions of the items being stored. This is a clear example of analogical transfer.\n\nOption C (color-changing chair) involves adaptation based on environmental factors, not the properties of what's being supported/stored.\n\nOption D (table with wireless charging) adds a technological feature but doesn't involve adapting to physical properties of stored items.\n\nStep 3: Select the option that best maintains the core principle.\nOption B most clearly transfers the adaptive storage principle from bookshelves to kitchen cabinets, making it the best example of analogical transfer."
