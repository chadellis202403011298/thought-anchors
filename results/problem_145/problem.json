  "question": "A local community center needs to create a multi-purpose room with very limited resources. They have a small rectangular space (approximately 500 square feet), basic furniture (10 chairs, 3 tables, and 2 bookshelves), and a budget of only $200 for additional materials. The room needs to serve five different functions throughout the week: 1) A meeting space for 10 people, 2) A quiet reading area, 3) A small art studio, 4) A space for yoga classes, and 5) A game night venue. Using divergent thinking principles, generate at least 5 different practical design solutions or ideas that would allow this single room to efficiently serve all these functions. For each idea, briefly explain how it addresses multiple needs with minimal resources.",
  "answer": "Solution using divergent thinking principles:\n\n1. Modular Furniture System:\n   - Use hinged tables that can fold against walls when not in use\n   - Implement stackable chairs that can be arranged in circles for meetings, lined against walls during yoga, or grouped in small clusters for reading\n   - Create convertible bookshelves with wheels that divide the space during reading hours but can be moved aside for yoga\n   - This addresses all functions by allowing rapid reconfiguration of the same basic elements\n\n2. Zone-Based Design with Visual Cues:\n   - Divide the room into color-coded zones using inexpensive floor paint or tape ($30)\n   - Create clear visual markers for each function (meeting zone, art zone, etc.)\n   - Use hanging fabric dividers ($50) that can be pulled across or retracted depending on the activity\n   - Store function-specific materials in color-matched bins corresponding to each zone\n   - This creates spatial organization without permanent walls\n\n3. Time-Based Transformation System:\n   - Design a standard layout that serves as the baseline configuration\n   - Create simple, illustrated instruction cards showing how to transform the space for each function\n   - Build wall-mounted storage units ($100) with labeled sections for materials specific to each function\n   - Train volunteers in quick 10-minute transition routines between activities\n   - This makes transitions efficient and uses time instead of resources to solve the problem\n\n4. Vertical Space Utilization:\n   - Install inexpensive ceiling hooks ($25) and pulley systems ($40) to hang and retrieve art supplies, yoga mats, and game materials\n   - Mount folding writing surfaces to walls that can be deployed for meetings/art and folded away for yoga/games\n   - Use high shelving with clearly labeled pull-down baskets ($75) to store function-specific items\n   - This utilizes often-overlooked vertical space, keeping floor space clear for different activities\n\n5. Dual-Purpose Design Elements:\n   - Cover tabletops with whiteboard material ($60) to serve as both work surfaces and meeting planning tools\n   - Use floor cushions ($50) that work for yoga, casual reading, and informal game nights\n   - Invest in rolling storage ottomans ($80) that provide seating, storage, and can define spaces\n   - Install adjustable lighting ($40) with preset configurations for each function (bright for art, dim for reading)\n   - This makes each element serve multiple purposes, reducing the total items needed\n\nThe divergent thinking process used here involves considering multiple solutions rather than fixating on an obvious approach, examining the problem from different angles (spatial design, time management, vertical thinking), and combining functions to create efficient multi-purpose elements."
