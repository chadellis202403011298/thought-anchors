  "question": "Consider the following analogy: STUDENT is to LEARN as ARTIST is to PAINT. Following the same pattern, what would complete this analogy? CHEF is to COOK as WRITER is to _____.",
  "answer": "The correct answer is 'WRITE'.\n\nStep 1: Analyze the first analogy (STUDENT is to LEARN as ARTIST is to PAINT).\n- A STUDENT's primary activity or function is to LEARN.\n- An ARTIST's primary activity or function is to PAINT.\n- This establishes a pattern where the second term represents the primary action performed by the first term.\n\nStep 2: Apply this pattern to the second analogy (CHEF is to COOK as WRITER is to ___).\n- A CHEF's primary activity or function is to COOK.\n- Following the same pattern, a WRITER's primary activity or function would be to WRITE.\n\nStep 3: Verify the relationship is consistent.\n- In all cases, the second term is the verb that describes the defining action performed by the person in the first term.\n- STUDENT \u2192 LEARN\n- ARTIST \u2192 PAINT\n- CHEF \u2192 COOK\n- WRITER \u2192 WRITE\n\nTherefore, 'WRITE' completes the analogy."
