  "question": "In a survey of 80 students, the following information was collected:\n- 45 students enjoy reading fiction\n- 38 students enjoy reading non-fiction\n- 15 students do not enjoy reading at all\n\nHow many students enjoy reading both fiction and non-fiction?",
  "answer": "To solve this problem, I'll use a Venn diagram approach:\n\nStep 1: Identify what we know.\n- Total students: 80\n- Students who enjoy fiction: 45\n- Students who enjoy non-fiction: 38\n- Students who don't enjoy reading at all: 15\n\nStep 2: Set up the equation based on the Venn diagram regions.\nLet x = number of students who enjoy both fiction and non-fiction\n\nStep 3: The total number of students can be calculated as:\n(Students who enjoy only fiction) + (Students who enjoy only non-fiction) + (Students who enjoy both) + (Students who enjoy neither)\n\nThis translates to:\n(45 - x) + (38 - x) + x + 15 = 80\n\nStep 4: Solve for x.\n45 - x + 38 - x + x + 15 = 80\n45 + 38 + 15 - x = 80\n98 - x = 80\nx = 18\n\nTherefore, 18 students enjoy reading both fiction and non-fiction."
