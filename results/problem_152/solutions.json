End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: In a survey of 80 students, the following information was collected:\n- 45 students enjoy reading fiction\n- 38 students enjoy reading non-fiction\n- 15 students do not enjoy reading at all\n\nHow many students enjoy reading both fiction and non-fiction? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this problem here about a survey of 80 students. It says that 45 students enjoy reading fiction, 38 enjoy reading non-fiction, and 15 don't enjoy reading at all. The question is asking how many students enjoy reading both fiction and non-fiction. Hmm, okay, let me try to figure this out.\n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with groups and overlapping sets, I should probably use a Venn diagram or some kind of formula related to sets. I think it's called the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Yeah, that sounds right. So, the formula for two sets is:\n\nTotal = Number in Set A + Number in Set B - Number in Both A and B\n\nIn this case, Set A would be the students who enjoy reading fiction, which is 45, and Set B would be the students who enjoy reading non-fiction, which is 38. The \"Total\" here refers to the total number of students surveyed, which is 80. But wait, there's also 15 students who don't enjoy reading at all. So, I need to account for that.\n\nLet me think. If 15 students don't enjoy reading, that means they are not in either Set A or Set B. So, they are outside both circles in the Venn diagram. Therefore, the number of students who enjoy at least one of the two types of reading would be the total surveyed minus those who don't enjoy reading. That is, 80 - 15 = 65 students enjoy either fiction or non-fiction or both.\n\nSo now, I can rewrite the inclusion-exclusion formula. Instead of the total being 80, it's 65 because that's the number of students who enjoy at least one of the two genres. Let me write that down:\n\n65 = 45 + 38 - Both\n\nSo, 45 is the number who enjoy fiction, 38 is the number who enjoy non-fiction, and \"Both\" is what we're trying to find. Let me solve for \"Both\":\n\nBoth = 45 + 38 - 65\n\nLet me do the addition first: 45 + 38 = 83\n\nThen subtract 65 from 83: 83 - 65 = 18\n\nSo, does that mean 18 students enjoy both fiction and non-fiction? Let me check that again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, let me double-check. If 18 students enjoy both, then the number who enjoy only fiction would be 45 - 18 = 27, and the number who enjoy only non-fiction would be 38 - 18 = 20. Then, adding those up: 27 + 20 + 18 = 65, which matches the number of students who enjoy at least one genre. And then adding the 15 who don't enjoy reading, the total is 80. That all adds up.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it another way. The total number of students who enjoy reading is 45 + 38 = 83, but since there are only 80 students in total, 83 - 80 = 3. That means 3 students are being counted twice when we add fiction and non-fiction readers. So, those 3 students must be the ones who enjoy both. Wait, that's conflicting with my previous answer of 18.\n\nHmm, that's confusing. Which one is correct? Let me think carefully. Maybe I misunderstood the initial approach.\n\nWait, no, actually, I think I made a mistake in the second method. Because when I added 45 and 38, I got 83, but the total number of students is 80. So, the overlap should account for the excess. The formula is:\n\nNumber in Both = Number in A + Number in B - Total Students\n\nWhich would be 45 + 38 - 80 = 3\n\nBut that contradicts the first method where I got 18.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. So, which one is correct?\n\nLet me go back. In the first method, I considered that 15 students don't enjoy reading, so 80 - 15 = 65 enjoy at least one. Then, using inclusion-exclusion:\n\n65 = 45 + 38 - Both => Both = 45 + 38 - 65 = 18\n\nIn the second method, I considered the total students as 80, so:\n\nBoth = 45 + 38 - 80 = 3\n\nBut these two results are different. There must be a misunderstanding here.\n\nWait, perhaps the second method is incorrect because the 45 and 38 already include the students who might be in both categories. So, when I add them, I might be double-counting the overlap. So, to find the actual number of unique students who enjoy either fiction or non-fiction, I need to subtract the overlap once. That's why the first method is correct.\n\nIn the second approach, I was trying to find the overlap based on the total students, but actually, the total students include those who don't enjoy reading, so I can't directly use the formula like that without adjusting for the non-readers.\n\nSo, the correct number is 18 students who enjoy both fiction and non-fiction.\n\nLet me confirm with another approach. The number of students who enjoy only fiction is 45 - 18 = 27, only non-fiction is 38 - 18 = 20, both is 18, and none is 15. So, 27 + 20 + 18 + 15 = 80, which matches the total. That checks out.\n\nSo, the correct answer is 18 students.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of students who enjoy both fiction and non-fiction, we use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. \n\n1. Calculate the number of students who enjoy at least one genre:\n   Total students surveyed - Students who don't enjoy reading = 80 - 15 = 65.\n\n2. Apply the inclusion-exclusion principle:\n   Number of students who enjoy fiction + Number who enjoy non-fiction - Both = 65\n   45 + 38 - Both = 65\n   Both = 45 + 38 - 65 = 18.\n\n**Answer:** 18 students enjoy reading both fiction and non-fiction.\n\nDONE."

It says that 45 students enjoy reading fiction, 38 enjoy reading non-fiction, and 15 don't enjoy reading at all. The question is asking how many students enjoy reading both fiction and non-fiction. Hmm, okay. Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember something about sets and maybe using a Venn diagram to solve problems like this. So, if I imagine two overlapping circles, one for fiction and one for non-fiction, the overlapping part would represent the students who enjoy both. That makes sense because the question is about the intersection of the two groups.\n\nSo, the total number of students surveyed is 80. Out of these, 15 don't enjoy reading at all. That means the remaining students must enjoy reading either fiction, non-fiction, or both. Let me calculate that. If 80 students total and 15 don't like reading, then 80 minus 15 is 65 students who enjoy reading in some form. Okay, so 65 students enjoy reading either fiction, non-fiction, or both.\n\nNow, the problem gives me the number of students who enjoy reading fiction and those who enjoy non-fiction. That's 45 and 38, respectively. But wait, some students might be in both groups. If I just add 45 and 38, that would give me 83, but that's more than the total number of students surveyed. That can't be right because there are only 65 students who enjoy reading. So, there must be some overlap between the two groups. \n\nThis seems like a problem where I can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. The formula for that is:\n\nTotal = Fiction + Non-Fiction - Both + Neither\n\nBut in this case, since we already know the total number of students and those who don't enjoy reading, maybe I can rearrange the formula to find the number who enjoy both.\n\nLet me write down what I know:\n\n- Total students, T = 80\n- Students who don't enjoy reading, N = 15\n- Students who enjoy fiction, F = 45\n- Students who enjoy non-fiction, NF = 38\n- Students who enjoy both, B = ?\n\nSo, the students who enjoy reading are T - N, which is 80 - 15 = 65.\n\nUsing the inclusion-exclusion principle:\n\nT - N = F + NF - B\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n65 = 45 + 38 - B\n\nLet me do the math on the right side first. 45 plus 38 is 83. So,\n\n65 = 83 - B\n\nTo find B, I can subtract 65 from 83, but wait, that's not right. Let me think again. If 65 equals 83 minus B, then I can rearrange the equation to solve for B.\n\nSo, 65 = 83 - B\n\nSubtract 83 from both sides: 65 - 83 = -B\n\nThat gives me -18 = -B\n\nThen, multiplying both sides by -1: 18 = B\n\nSo, 18 students enjoy reading both fiction and non-fiction.\n\nWait, let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make a mistake. If 18 students enjoy both, then the number of students who enjoy only fiction would be 45 - 18 = 27, and those who enjoy only non-fiction would be 38 - 18 = 20. Adding those up: 27 + 20 + 18 = 65, which matches the number of students who enjoy reading. And adding the 15 who don't, we get 80 total students. Yep, that checks out.\n\nSo, I think the answer is 18 students enjoy reading both fiction and non-fiction.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of students who enjoy both fiction and non-fiction, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\n\n1. **Calculate the number of students who enjoy reading:**\n   Total students surveyed = 80\n   Students who don't enjoy reading = 15\n   Students who enjoy reading = 80 - 15 = 65\n\n2. **Apply the inclusion-exclusion principle:**\n   Total who enjoy reading = Students who enjoy fiction + Students who enjoy non-fiction - Students who enjoy both\n   65 = 45 + 38 - Both\n\n3. **Solve for Both:**\n   65 = 83 - Both\n   Both = 83 - 65\n   Both = 18\n\nSo, **18 students enjoy reading both fiction and non-fiction.**\n\nDONE."
