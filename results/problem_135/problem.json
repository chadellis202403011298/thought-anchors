  "question": "Four friends - Alex, Ben, Clara, and Diana - each own exactly one pet. The pets are a dog, a cat, a bird, and a fish, but not necessarily in that order. Based on the following clues, determine which pet belongs to which friend:\n\n1. Alex does not own the dog or the fish.\n2. Ben owns either the bird or the cat.\n3. Clara doesn't like animals with fur.\n4. Diana is allergic to feathers.",
  "answer": "Step 1: Let's organize what we know about each person and each pet.\n\nStep 2: From clue 1, Alex doesn't own the dog or the fish. This means Alex must own either the cat or the bird.\n\nStep 3: From clue 2, Ben owns either the bird or the cat.\n\nStep 4: From clue 3, Clara doesn't like animals with fur. Dogs and cats have fur, so Clara must own either the bird or the fish.\n\nStep 5: From clue 4, Diana is allergic to feathers. This means Diana cannot own the bird. So Diana must own the dog, the cat, or the fish.\n\nStep 6: From Steps 4 and 5, we know Clara and Diana can't both own the bird, and they can't both own the fish. Since they are the only options for Clara, and Diana can't own the bird, Clara must own the bird and Diana must own the fish.\n\nStep 7: Now we know Alex and Ben must own the dog and the cat between them. From clue 1, Alex can't own the dog, so Alex must own the cat and Ben must own the dog.\n\nStep 8: However, this contradicts clue 2, which says Ben owns either the bird or the cat. Let's reconsider our reasoning.\n\nStep 9: If Ben owns either the bird or the cat, and Clara owns the bird (from Step 6), then Ben must own the cat.\n\nStep 10: If Ben owns the cat, and Diana owns the fish (from Step 6), then Alex and Clara must own the dog and the bird between them.\n\nStep 11: From clue 1, Alex can't own the dog, so Alex must own the bird and Clara must own the dog.\n\nStep 12: But this contradicts clue 3, since Clara doesn't like animals with fur, and dogs have fur. Let's reconsider again.\n\nStep 13: Let's try a different approach. From clue 3, Clara doesn't like animals with fur (dogs and cats), so she must own either the bird or the fish.\n\nStep 14: From clue 4, Diana is allergic to feathers, so she can't own the bird. She must own the dog, cat, or fish.\n\nStep 15: From clue 1, Alex can't own the dog or fish, so Alex must own the cat or bird.\n\nStep 16: From clue 2, Ben owns either the bird or cat.\n\nStep 17: If Clara can only own the bird or fish, and Diana can't own the bird, then if Clara owns the fish, Diana must own either the dog or the cat.\n\nStep 18: In this scenario, Alex and Ben would have to own the bird and cat between them. But since they both can only own the bird or cat, they can't own the dog. This means Diana must own the dog.\n\nStep 19: If Diana owns the dog, and Clara owns the fish, then Alex and Ben must own the bird and cat. Since Ben owns either the bird or cat, and Alex can only own the bird or cat as well, either arrangement is possible. But we need a unique solution, so this approach leads to a contradiction.\n\nStep 20: Let's try the other possibility: Clara owns the bird. Then Diana must own the dog or cat or fish.\n\nStep 21: If Clara owns the bird, then Ben (who can only own the bird or cat) must own the cat.\n\nStep 22: If Ben owns the cat and Clara owns the bird, then Alex and Diana must own the dog and fish between them.\n\nStep 23: From clue 1, Alex can't own the dog or fish. This is a contradiction, so our assignment is wrong.\n\nStep 24: Let's start over with a more systematic approach. From clue 4, Diana can't own the bird. From clue 3, Clara can't own the dog or cat (animals with fur).\n\nStep 25: So Clara must own either the bird or the fish. If Clara owns the bird, then Diana must own the dog, cat, or fish.\n\nStep 26: From clue 1, Alex can't own the dog or fish. From clue 2, Ben owns either the bird or cat.\n\nStep 27: If Clara owns the bird, then Ben can't own the bird (as Clara already has it), so Ben must own the cat.\n\nStep 28: If Ben owns the cat and Clara owns the bird, then Alex and Diana must own the dog and fish between them.\n\nStep 29: But from clue 1, Alex can't own either the dog or fish. This is a contradiction.\n\nStep 30: So Clara must own the fish, not the bird.\n\nStep 31: If Clara owns the fish, then Diana must own the dog or cat (as she can't own the bird due to her allergy to feathers).\n\nStep 32: From clue 2, Ben owns either the bird or cat. If Ben owns the bird, then Diana must own the cat (as she can't own the bird).\n\nStep 33: If Diana owns the cat, and Ben owns the bird, and Clara owns the fish, then Alex must own the dog. But this contradicts clue 1.\n\nStep 34: So Ben must own the cat, not the bird.\n\nStep 35: If Ben owns the cat, and Clara owns the fish, then Alex and Diana must own the bird and dog between them.\n\nStep 36: From clue 1, Alex can't own the dog. So Alex must own the bird, and Diana must own the dog.\n\nStep 37: Let's double-check: Alex owns the bird (consistent with clue 1), Ben owns the cat (consistent with clue 2), Clara owns the fish (consistent with clue 3), and Diana owns the dog (consistent with clue 4).\n\nStep 38: This assignment violates clue 4, since we assigned the bird to Alex, not Diana, which is consistent since Diana is allergic to feathers.\n\nFinal conclusion: Alex owns the bird, Ben owns the cat, Clara owns the fish, and Diana owns the dog."
