  "question": "A 3D object has the following orthographic projections:\n\nFront view: A square with a side length of 2 units\nTop view: A square with a side length of 2 units\nSide view: A square with a side length of 2 units\n\nWhat is the shape of this 3D object, and what is its volume?",
  "answer": "To determine the shape of the 3D object, I need to analyze the orthographic projections given:\n\n1. The front view is a square with side length 2 units\n2. The top view is a square with side length 2 units\n3. The side view is a square with side length 2 units\n\nWhen an object has square projections of the same size from all three orthographic views, it indicates a cube. This is because a cube has identical square faces in all directions.\n\nThe dimensions of the cube can be determined from the side lengths of the projections:\n- Length = 2 units (from the front view)\n- Width = 2 units (from the side view)\n- Height = 2 units (from the top view)\n\nThe volume of a cube is calculated using the formula: Volume = length \u00d7 width \u00d7 height\n\nTherefore, the volume of this cube is:\nVolume = 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 = 8 cubic units\n\nAnswer: The 3D object is a cube with a volume of 8 cubic units."
