  "question": "A small town has established a community garden to promote sustainable agriculture. Initially, the garden has 20 active participants. Each month, existing participants invite friends at a rate where each current participant successfully recruits 0.1 new participants on average (i.e., 10 current participants bring in 1 new participant). However, the garden also experiences a monthly dropout rate of 5% of current participants who lose interest. Assuming this system continues unchanged, approximately how many participants will the community garden have after 12 months? Identify whether this represents a positive feedback loop, a negative feedback loop, or both, and explain your reasoning.",
  "answer": "To solve this problem, I need to track how the number of participants changes month by month based on the given rates.\n\nLet's use P(n) to represent the number of participants in month n, with P(0) = 20 participants initially.\n\nFor each month:\n- New participants = 0.1 \u00d7 Current participants\n- Dropouts = 0.05 \u00d7 Current participants\n- Net change = (0.1 - 0.05) \u00d7 Current participants = 0.05 \u00d7 Current participants\n\nSo the recurrence relation is: P(n+1) = P(n) + 0.05 \u00d7 P(n) = 1.05 \u00d7 P(n)\n\nCalculating month by month:\nP(0) = 20\nP(1) = 1.05 \u00d7 20 = 21\nP(2) = 1.05 \u00d7 21 = 22.05\nP(3) = 1.05 \u00d7 22.05 = 23.15\nP(4) = 1.05 \u00d7 23.15 = 24.31\nP(5) = 1.05 \u00d7 24.31 = 25.53\nP(6) = 1.05 \u00d7 25.53 = 26.80\nP(7) = 1.05 \u00d7 26.80 = 28.14\nP(8) = 1.05 \u00d7 28.14 = 29.55\nP(9) = 1.05 \u00d7 29.55 = 31.03\nP(10) = 1.05 \u00d7 31.03 = 32.58\nP(11) = 1.05 \u00d7 32.58 = 34.21\nP(12) = 1.05 \u00d7 34.21 = 35.92\n\nTherefore, after 12 months, the community garden will have approximately 36 participants (rounding to the nearest whole number).\n\nThis scenario involves both types of feedback loops:\n\n1. Positive feedback loop: As more participants join, they recruit more friends, further increasing the number of participants. This is a reinforcing loop where growth leads to more growth.\n\n2. Negative feedback loop: As the number of participants increases, more people drop out (5% of a larger number is more people), which acts as a balancing mechanism.\n\nHowever, because the recruitment rate (0.1 per participant) exceeds the dropout rate (0.05 per participant), the positive feedback loop dominates, resulting in steady growth over time. If the dropout rate were higher than the recruitment rate, the system would eventually stabilize or decline."
