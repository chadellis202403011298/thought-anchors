  "question": "Consider a universe of discourse consisting of the positive integers {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. Let P(x) be the predicate 'x is even' and Q(x) be the predicate 'x is prime'. Determine whether each of the following statements is true or false:\n\na) \u2203x(P(x) \u2227 Q(x))\nb) \u2200x(P(x) \u2192 \u00acQ(x))\nc) \u2200x(Q(x) \u2192 \u00acP(x))\nd) \u2203x(\u00acP(x) \u2227 \u00acQ(x))",
  "answer": "To solve this problem, I need to evaluate each statement by checking the predicates P(x) and Q(x) for each element in our universe {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.\n\nFirst, let me identify which elements satisfy each predicate:\n- Even numbers (P(x)): 2, 4\n- Prime numbers (Q(x)): 2, 3, 5\n\nNow I'll evaluate each statement:\n\na) \u2203x(P(x) \u2227 Q(x))\nThis states: 'There exists an x such that x is even AND x is prime.'\nChecking each value in our universe:\n- x = 2: P(2) is true (2 is even) and Q(2) is true (2 is prime)\nSince I found at least one value that makes P(x) \u2227 Q(x) true, the statement is TRUE.\n\nb) \u2200x(P(x) \u2192 \u00acQ(x))\nThis states: 'For all x, if x is even, then x is not prime.'\nChecking the even numbers:\n- x = 2: P(2) is true, but \u00acQ(2) is false (since 2 is prime)\n- x = 4: P(4) is true, and \u00acQ(4) is true (since 4 is not prime)\nSince there is at least one counterexample (x = 2), the statement is FALSE.\n\nc) \u2200x(Q(x) \u2192 \u00acP(x))\nThis states: 'For all x, if x is prime, then x is not even.'\nChecking the prime numbers:\n- x = 2: Q(2) is true, but \u00acP(2) is false (since 2 is even)\n- x = 3: Q(3) is true, and \u00acP(3) is true (since 3 is not even)\n- x = 5: Q(5) is true, and \u00acP(5) is true (since 5 is not even)\nSince there is at least one counterexample (x = 2), the statement is FALSE.\n\nd) \u2203x(\u00acP(x) \u2227 \u00acQ(x))\nThis states: 'There exists an x such that x is not even AND x is not prime.'\nChecking each value:\n- x = 1: \u00acP(1) is true (1 is not even) and \u00acQ(1) is true (1 is not prime)\nSince I found at least one value that makes \u00acP(x) \u2227 \u00acQ(x) true, the statement is TRUE."
