  "question": "An object is represented by the following three orthographic projections:\n\nFront view: A rectangle with width 4 units and height 3 units\nTop view: A rectangle with width 4 units and depth 2 units\nSide view (from right): A rectangle with depth 2 units and height 3 units\n\nWhich of the following 3D objects is consistent with these orthographic projections?\nA) A rectangular prism with dimensions 4\u00d72\u00d73\nB) An L-shaped object formed by removing a 2\u00d71\u00d71 block from a 4\u00d72\u00d73 rectangular prism\nC) A T-shaped object formed by placing a 4\u00d71\u00d71 block on top of a 2\u00d72\u00d72 block\nD) A rectangular prism with dimensions 3\u00d74\u00d72",
  "answer": "Step 1: Understand what orthographic projections tell us.\n- The front view shows width (left-right) and height (up-down).\n- The top view shows width (left-right) and depth (front-back).\n- The side view shows depth (front-back) and height (up-down).\n\nStep 2: Extract the dimensions from the projections.\n- From the front view: width = 4 units, height = 3 units\n- From the top view: width = 4 units, depth = 2 units\n- From the side view: depth = 2 units, height = 3 units\n\nStep 3: Analyze each option.\n\nOption A: A rectangular prism with dimensions 4\u00d72\u00d73\n- Width = 4, depth = 2, height = 3\n- Front view would be 4\u00d73 \u2713\n- Top view would be 4\u00d72 \u2713\n- Side view would be 2\u00d73 \u2713\nAll projections match.\n\nOption B: An L-shaped object (4\u00d72\u00d73 prism with 2\u00d71\u00d71 block removed)\nIf a block is removed, at least one of the projections would show a non-rectangular shape, but all given projections are rectangular.\n\nOption C: A T-shaped object\nThis would create non-rectangular projections in at least one view.\n\nOption D: A rectangular prism with dimensions 3\u00d74\u00d72\nThis swaps width and height compared to option A, which would change the projections.\n\nStep 4: Determine the answer.\nThe correct answer is A) A rectangular prism with dimensions 4\u00d72\u00d73, as it's the only option that produces all three orthographic projections as described."
