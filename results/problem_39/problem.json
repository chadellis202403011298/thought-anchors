  "question": "A man lives on the 15th floor of an apartment building. Every morning, he takes the elevator down to the ground floor to go to work. In the evening, when he returns from work, he takes the elevator to the 10th floor and then walks up the stairs for the remaining five floors to his apartment. However, on rainy days, he takes the elevator all the way to the 15th floor. Why does he do this?",
  "answer": "The man is of short stature and cannot reach the button for the 15th floor in the elevator. He can only reach the buttons up to the 10th floor. However, on rainy days, he carries an umbrella, which he can use to press the 15th-floor button. This problem requires creative reframing because the initial assumption might be that the man's behavior is related to exercise or some personal preference. However, by reframing the problem to consider physical limitations and tools available in different weather conditions, we can arrive at the actual solution. The key insight is to consider what's different on rainy days (the umbrella) and how that might affect his ability to interact with the elevator."
