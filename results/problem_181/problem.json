  "question": "A square is divided into 4 equal quadrants, with each quadrant labeled as follows: the top-left is white, the top-right is black, the bottom-left is black, and the bottom-right is white. If this square is reflected across a vertical line running through its center, what will be the resulting pattern? Describe which quadrants will be white and which will be black after the reflection.",
  "answer": "When reflecting a square across a vertical line running through its center, each point in the square will be mapped to a corresponding point on the opposite side of the vertical line, at the same distance from the line.\n\nStarting with our original pattern:\n- Top-left quadrant: white\n- Top-right quadrant: black\n- Bottom-left quadrant: black\n- Bottom-right quadrant: white\n\nAfter reflection across the vertical line:\n- The top-left quadrant (white) will be mapped to the top-right quadrant\n- The top-right quadrant (black) will be mapped to the top-left quadrant\n- The bottom-left quadrant (black) will be mapped to the bottom-right quadrant\n- The bottom-right quadrant (white) will be mapped to the bottom-left quadrant\n\nTherefore, the resulting pattern will be:\n- Top-left quadrant: black\n- Top-right quadrant: white\n- Bottom-left quadrant: white\n- Bottom-right quadrant: black\n\nThe reflection has essentially swapped the left and right sides of the square while preserving the positions relative to the horizontal axis."
