  "question": "A woman is sitting in her hotel room when there is a knock at the door. She opens it to find a man she has never seen before. He says, 'I'm sorry, I have made a mistake. I thought this was my room.' The woman immediately calls security and has the man removed from the hotel. Why did she react this way?",
  "answer": "The key to solving this problem is to shift your perspective from viewing the scenario as an innocent mistake to considering alternative contexts:\n\n1. Consider the woman's perspective and what information she might have that isn't explicitly stated in the problem.\n\n2. If the man genuinely made a mistake, the normal reaction would be to apologize and leave, not requiring security to remove him.\n\n3. The critical insight is that the woman was in her hotel room - hotels have peepholes on doors specifically so guests can see who's knocking before opening the door.\n\n4. Therefore, the woman must have seen the man through the peephole before opening the door.\n\n5. Since she opened the door to 'a man she had never seen before,' but then immediately called security when he claimed he thought it was his room, the man must have lied about something he could only know if he had actually seen her before.\n\n6. The logical conclusion is that the man recognized her through the peephole and concocted the excuse about the wrong room after she opened the door. His claim of mistaking the room contradicted the fact that he had clearly targeted her specifically, revealing dishonest intentions.\n\nBy shifting perspective to consider what the woman knew rather than just the surface narrative, we can see why her reaction was justified."
