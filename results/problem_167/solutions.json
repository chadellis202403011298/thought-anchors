Hmm, okay. Let me start by recalling what the problem is asking. It says that for any integer n greater than or equal to 1, the sum 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n is equal to n(n+1)/2. That sounds familiar\u2014it's the well-known formula for the sum of an arithmetic series, right?\n\nOkay, so first, maybe I should write out what the sum actually looks like for a few small values of n to see if I can spot a pattern or something. Let's try n=1, n=2, n=3, and so on.\n\nFor n=1: The sum is just 1. Plugging into the formula: 1(1+1)/2 = 2/2 = 1. That checks out.\n\nFor n=2: 1 + 2 = 3. The formula gives 2(2+1)/2 = 6/2 = 3. Still good.\n\nn=3: 1 + 2 + 3 = 6. Formula: 3(3+1)/2 = 12/2 = 6. Okay, working so far.\n\nn=4: 1+2+3+4=10. Formula: 4(5)/2 = 20/2=10. Yep, that's right.\n\nSo, it works for these small numbers. But that's not a proof. I need to show it works for any n >=1.\n\nHmm, how do I approach this? Maybe I can use induction? I remember that mathematical induction is a good way to prove statements like this.\n\nOkay, so let's try induction. Induction has two steps: the base case and the inductive step. \n\nBase case: n=1. We already checked that when n=1, the sum is 1, and the formula gives 1. So, the base case holds.\n\nInductive step: Assume that the formula holds for some arbitrary positive integer k. That is, assume that 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + k = k(k+1)/2. Now, we need to show that if the formula holds for n=k, it also holds for n=k+1.\n\nSo, let's compute the sum up to k+1: 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + k + (k+1). According to our assumption, the sum up to k is k(k+1)/2. So, adding (k+1) to both sides, we get:\n\nk(k+1)/2 + (k+1) = [k(k+1) + 2(k+1)] / 2.\n\nWait, let me factor out (k+1):\n\n= (k+1)(k + 2) / 2.\n\nWhich is exactly the formula for n = k+1, since n(n+1)/2 would be (k+1)(k+2)/2.\n\nTherefore, by induction, the formula holds for all positive integers n >=1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it another way without induction. I've heard of the \"pairing\" method. Suppose I write the sum forwards and backwards and then add them together.\n\nSo, writing the sum as:\n\n1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n\n\nAnd then writing it backwards:\n\nn + (n-1) + (n-2) + ... + 1\n\nNow, if I add these two sums together, term by term, I get:\n\n(1 + n) + (2 + (n-1)) + (3 + (n-2)) + ... + ((n-1) + 2) + (n + 1)\n\nEach pair adds up to (n + 1). How many such pairs are there? Well, there are n terms in the original sum, so when you pair them up, you have n/2 pairs if n is even, or (n-1)/2 pairs and a middle term if n is odd.\n\nWait, actually, no. If n is even, say n=4, there are 4 terms, so two pairs. If n is odd, say n=5, there are five terms, so two pairs and a middle term which is the third term, 3.\n\nBut in both cases, when you add them together, each pair adds up to (n + 1). So, for n even, the total would be (n+1) * (n/2). For n odd, it would be (n+1)*( (n-1)/2 ) + n.\n\nWait, but let me see. Let's take n=4:\n\nSum forward: 1+2+3+4=10\n\nSum backward: 4+3+2+1=10\n\nAdding them: 20\n\nAccording to the formula, n=4: 4*5/2=10, but 10+10=20, which is 4*5=20. So, that's (4+1)*4/2=20, which is the same as 4*5/2 *2=10*2=20.\n\nWait, maybe I'm complicating it. Let me try n=5.\n\nSum forward: 1+2+3+4+5=15\n\nSum backward:5+4+3+2+1=15\n\nAdding them: 30\n\nFormula:5*6/2=15, so 15+15=30, which is 5*6=30. Which is also (5+1)*5/2=15*2=30.\n\nSo, in both even and odd cases, the sum of the two sequences is n(n+1). Because when n is even, n/2 pairs, each adding to (n+1), so total sum is (n+1)*(n/2). Wait, but n(n+1)/2 is the original sum. So, when I add the forward and backward sums, I get n(n+1), which is twice the original sum. Therefore, the original sum is n(n+1)/2.\n\nSo, that's another way to see it.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as an arithmetic series. The sum of an arithmetic series is (number of terms)/2 times (first term + last term). In this case, the number of terms is n, the first term is 1, and the last term is n. So, the sum is n/2*(1 + n) = n(n+1)/2. That's a straightforward formula application.\n\nSo, there are multiple ways to look at it: induction, pairing, or using the arithmetic series formula.\n\nI think the inductive proof is probably the most straightforward for someone just learning it. It's logical and step-by-step. The pairing method is clever and shows a nice symmetry, but it's a bit more abstract. The arithmetic series formula is direct, assuming you already know that formula.\n\nBut to be thorough, maybe I should present both the inductive proof and the pairing method to have a complete understanding.\n\nAnother thought: sometimes people use a visual representation, like arranging objects in a particular way. For example, imagine you have n items, and you arrange them in a triangle. Each row has one more item than the row above. Then, the total number of items can be calculated in different ways, leading to the sum formula. But I think that's more of a mnemonic device rather than a proof.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the sum of the first n positive integers is indeed n(n+1)/2, and this can be proven by mathematical induction, by pairing terms, or by applying the arithmetic series sum formula.\n</think>\n\nThe sum of the first n positive integers is given by the formula:\n\n1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n = n(n+1)/2\n\n**Proof by Mathematical Induction:**\n\n1. **Base Case (n=1):**\n   - Sum = 1\n   - Formula: 1(1+1)/2 = 1\n   - Base case holds.\n\n2. **Inductive Step:**\n   - Assume the formula holds for n = k: 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + k = k(k+1)/2.\n   - For n = k + 1: Sum = [1 + 2 + ... + k] + (k + 1)\n   - Substitute the inductive hypothesis: k(k + 1)/2 + (k + 1)\n   - Factor out (k + 1): (k + 1)(k + 2)/2\n   - This matches the formula for n = k + 1: (k + 1)(k + 2)/2\n   - Thus, the formula holds for all n \u2265 1.\n\n**Alternative Proof by Pairing:**\n\nWrite the sum forwards and backwards:\n\n1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n\n\nn + (n - 1) + (n - 2) + ... + 1\n\nAdding these two equations:\n\n(1 + n) + (2 + (n - 1)) + (3 + (n - 2)) + ... + ((n - 1) + 2) + (n + 1)\n\nEach pair sums to (n + 1). There are n such pairs, so:\n\nTotal sum = n(n + 1)\n\nBut this is twice the original sum. Therefore:\n\nOriginal sum = n(n + 1)/2\n\n**Alternative Proof Using Arithmetic Series Formula:**\n\nThe sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic series is given by:\n\nSum = (number of terms)/2 \u00d7 (first term + last term)\n\nHere, number of terms = n, first term = 1, last term = n.\n\nSum = n/2 \u00d7 (1 + n) = n(n + 1)/2\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nIn all cases, the sum of the first n positive integers is n(n + 1)/2 for all integers n \u2265 1.\n\nDONE."

Hmm, I remember that there's a formula for this, but I'm not exactly sure how to derive it. Let me think about it step by step.\n\nFirst, let me write down the sum: 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n. I want to find a way to add these numbers together and see if I can simplify it to get n(n + 1)/2.\n\nI've heard of something called mathematical induction before. Maybe I can try that. But wait, is there another way? Sometimes, there are visual methods to understand these kinds of problems. Oh, right! I think there's a geometric approach where you can arrange the numbers in a certain way and see how they pair up.\n\nLet me try that. If I write the numbers from 1 to n and then write them again below, but shifted by one position, like this:\n\n1 2 3 4\n 1 2 3 4\n\nNow, if I add the numbers diagonally, each diagonal should give me 5. Let me check:\n\nFirst diagonal: 1 + 1 = 2\nSecond diagonal: 2 + 2 = 4\nThird diagonal: 3 + 3 = 6\nFourth diagonal: 4 + 4 = 8\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. I was expecting each diagonal to add up to 5. Maybe I did something wrong. Let me try again, but this time, I'll write them in a different way.\n\nAlternatively, I can write the sum forwards and backwards and then add them together:\n\n1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n\nn + (n-1) + (n-2) + ... + 1\n\nNow, if I add these two sums together, term by term, I get:\n\n(1 + n) + (2 + (n-1)) + (3 + (n-2)) + ... + (n + 1)\n\nEach of these pairs adds up to n + 1. How many such pairs are there? Well, there are n terms in the original sum, so when I add them forwards and backwards, I have n pairs, each adding to n + 1. So the total sum would be n*(n + 1).\n\nBut wait, that's the sum of both the forward and backward sequences. The original sum is just half of that. So the sum 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n is equal to n(n + 1)/2. That makes sense!\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use induction. Let me try that approach too. For induction, I need to show that the formula holds for a base case, say n = 1. Then, assume it holds for some integer k, and show it holds for k + 1.\n\nBase case: n = 1. The sum is just 1, and the formula gives 1*(1 + 1)/2 = 1. So it works for n = 1.\n\nInductive step: Assume that for n = k, 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + k = k(k + 1)/2.\n\nNow, consider n = k + 1. The sum is 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + k + (k + 1). According to the inductive hypothesis, the sum up to k is k(k + 1)/2. So adding (k + 1) gives k(k + 1)/2 + (k + 1) = (k + 1)(k + 1)/2 = (k + 1)(k + 1)/2. That matches the formula for n = k + 1. So by induction, the formula holds for all positive integers n.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the inductive step. Let me double-check that. So, if I have the sum up to k, which is k(k + 1)/2, and I add (k + 1) to it, I get k(k + 1)/2 + (k + 1). Factoring out (k + 1), I get (k + 1)(k/2 + 1). Hmm, that's (k + 1)(k + 2)/2, which is the same as (k + 1)(k + 1 + 1)/2. So yes, that works. So the inductive step holds.\n\nSo both methods, the geometric pairing and mathematical induction, confirm that the sum is n(n + 1)/2. I think that's a solid proof.\n</think>\n\nThe sum of the first n positive integers is given by the formula:  \n1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n = n(n + 1)/2 for all integers n \u2265 1.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation and Proof:**\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   We aim to prove that the sum of the first n positive integers can be expressed as n(n + 1)/2.\n\n2. **Method 1: Geometric Pairing (Arithmetic Series Sum):**\n   - Write the numbers forwards and backwards and add them together:\n     ```\n     1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n\n     n + (n-1) + (n-2) + ... + 1\n     ```\n   - Adding these two sequences term by term:\n     ```\n     (1 + n) + (2 + (n-1)) + (3 + (n-2)) + ... + (n + 1)\n     ```\n   - Each pair sums to (n + 1), and there are n such pairs:\n     ```\n     n(n + 1)\n     ```\n   - Since we've effectively summed the original sequence twice, divide by 2 to get the sum:\n     ```\n     n(n + 1)/2\n     ```\n\n3. **Method 2: Mathematical Induction:**\n   - **Base Case (n = 1):**\n     Sum = 1. Formula gives 1(1 + 1)/2 = 1. Thus, it holds for n = 1.\n   \n   - **Inductive Step:**\n     Assume the formula holds for n = k, i.e., 1 + 2 + ... + k = k(k + 1)/2.\n   \n     For n = k + 1:\n     Sum = 1 + 2 + ... + k + (k + 1) = [k(k + 1)/2] + (k + 1) = (k + 1)(k + 1)/2 = (k + 1)(k + 1)/2.\n   \n     Thus, the formula holds for n = k + 1.\n   \n   - By induction, the formula holds for all positive integers n.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBoth methods confirm that the sum of the first n positive integers is n(n + 1)/2.\n\nDONE."

Hmm, I remember this formula from arithmetic series, but I'm not exactly sure how to derive it. Let me think about it step by step.\n\nFirst, let's write down what the sum looks like. If I have the numbers 1, 2, 3, ..., n, adding them up would give me 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n. I need to find a way to simplify this expression.\n\nMaybe I can try adding the numbers in pairs. Let's see, if I take the first and last terms: 1 + n, then the second and second-to-last terms: 2 + (n - 1), and so on. How many such pairs are there? Well, if I have n terms, pairing them would give me n/2 pairs. Each pair adds up to (1 + n), (2 + (n - 1)), etc.\n\nWait, let me check with a specific example to make sure I'm on the right track. Let's say n is 5. Then the pairs would be (1 + 5) = 6 and (2 + 4) = 6, and then there's the middle term 3 left. So the sum would be 6 + 6 + 3 = 15. Using the formula, n(n + 1)/2 would be 5*6/2 = 15. Okay, that matches. So maybe this pairing method works.\n\nBut how do I generalize this for any n? Let's see, each pair adds up to (n + 1), right? Because 1 + n = n + 1, 2 + (n - 1) = n + 1, and so on. So each pair sums to n + 1. How many such pairs are there? If n is even, there are n/2 pairs. If n is odd, there's an extra middle term, which is (n + 1)/2. Wait, but in the case where n is odd, the number of pairs would still be n/2, but since n is odd, n/2 isn't an integer. Hmm, maybe I need to adjust that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another approach. I remember something about Gauss's trick where you write the sum forwards and backwards and add them together. Let me try that. So,\n\nSum = 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n\nSum = n + (n - 1) + (n - 2) + ... + 2 + 1\n\nNow, if I add these two equations together term by term, I get:\n\n2 * Sum = (1 + n) + (2 + (n - 1)) + (3 + (n - 2)) + ... + ((n) + 1)\n\nEach of these pairs adds up to (n + 1). How many such pairs are there? For n terms, there are n pairs. So,\n\n2 * Sum = n * (n + 1)\nTherefore, Sum = n * (n + 1) / 2\n\nThat makes sense. Let me test this with n = 5 again. 5*6/2 = 15, which matches the earlier result. And for n = 4, 4*5/2 = 10. Let me check: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10. Yep, that works.\n\nWait, but earlier when I tried pairing, I was confused about whether the number of pairs is n/2 or n. Now I see that by adding the two equations, I get n pairs each adding to n + 1. So, that resolves the confusion. Each term in the original sum is paired with a corresponding term in the reversed sum, resulting in n pairs.\n\nSo, this method seems solid. But I also remember another approach, maybe using mathematical induction. Let me try that as well to confirm.\n\nBase case: n = 1. Sum = 1. Formula: 1*2/2 = 1. So it holds.\n\nInductive step: Assume that for some integer k \u2265 1, the sum 1 + 2 + ... + k = k(k + 1)/2. Now, consider the sum up to k + 1: 1 + 2 + ... + k + (k + 1). By the inductive hypothesis, this is k(k + 1)/2 + (k + 1). Factor out (k + 1): (k + 1)(k/2 + 1) = (k + 1)(k + 2)/2. Which is the formula for n = k + 1. Thus, by induction, the formula holds for all positive integers n.\n\nOkay, that's another way to confirm it. So both the pairing method and mathematical induction support the formula. I think I'm confident enough that the sum of the first n positive integers is indeed n(n + 1)/2.\n</think>\n\nThe sum of the first n positive integers is given by the formula \\( \\frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \\) for all integers \\( n \\geq 1 \\).\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Understand the Problem:** We need to prove that the sum of all integers from 1 to n is equal to \\( \\frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \\).\n\n2. **Write the Sum:** The sum \\( S \\) can be written as:\n   \\[\n   S = 1 + 2 + 3 + \\dots + n\n   \\]\n\n3. **Gauss's Pairing Method:**\n   - Write the sum forwards and backwards:\n     \\[\n     S = 1 + 2 + 3 + \\dots + n\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     S = n + (n - 1) + (n - 2) + \\dots + 2 + 1\n     \\]\n   - Add these two equations term by term:\n     \\[\n     2S = (1 + n) + (2 + (n - 1)) + (3 + (n - 2)) + \\dots + ((n) + 1)\n     \\]\n   - Each pair sums to \\( n + 1 \\), and there are \\( n \\) such pairs:\n     \\[\n     2S = n(n + 1)\n     \\]\n   - Solve for \\( S \\):\n     \\[\n     S = \\frac{n(n + 1)}{2}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Verification with Examples:**\n   - For \\( n = 5 \\):\n     \\[\n     S = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15\n     \\]\n     Using the formula:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{5 \\times 6}{2} = 15\n     \\]\n   - For \\( n = 4 \\):\n     \\[\n     S = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10\n     \\]\n     Using the formula:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10\n     \\]\n\n5. **Mathematical Induction:**\n   - **Base Case:** For \\( n = 1 \\):\n     \\[\n     S = 1 = \\frac{1 \\times 2}{2} = 1\n     \\]\n   - **Inductive Step:** Assume \\( S(k) = \\frac{k(k + 1)}{2} \\) holds for some integer \\( k \\geq 1 \\).

Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this. I remember that this formula is pretty famous, called Gauss's formula or something like that. But I'm not exactly sure how Gauss came up with it. Maybe I can figure it out myself.\n\nFirst, let's write down the sum we're trying to find: 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n. I need to show that this is equal to n(n+1)/2. So, maybe I can start by writing the sum and see if I can manipulate it somehow.\n\nLet me denote the sum as S, so S = 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n. Now, I wonder if there's a way to pair terms from the beginning and the end of the sequence. Let's see, if I take the first term, which is 1, and the last term, which is n, their sum is 1 + n. Similarly, the second term is 2, and the second last term is n-1, so 2 + (n-1) = n+1. Wait, that's interesting. Let me write that down:\n\n1 + n = n+1  \n2 + (n-1) = n+1  \n3 + (n-2) = n+1  \n...  \nContinuing this pattern, the k-th term from the start plus the k-th term from the end equals n+1.\n\nNow, how many such pairs are there? Well, since there are n terms in total, there are n/2 pairs if n is even. But what if n is odd? Then, there's a middle term that doesn't have a pair. For example, if n=5, the middle term is 3. So, in that case, the sum would be (1+5) + (2+4) + 3. Each pair sums to 6, and there are 2 pairs, so 6*2 + 3 = 15, which is equal to 5*6/2 = 15. So, even if n is odd, the formula still holds because the middle term is n/2, but wait, n is odd, so n/2 isn't an integer. Hmm, maybe I need to adjust my thinking.\n\nWait, no. Let's take n=5. The sum is 1+2+3+4+5=15. According to the formula, it should be 5*6/2=15, which matches. So, whether n is even or odd, the formula works. So, going back to the pairing idea, if n is even, there are n/2 pairs, each summing to n+1. So, the total sum would be (n+1)*(n/2). If n is odd, then there are (n-1)/2 pairs, each summing to n+1, and the middle term is (n+1)/2. So, the total sum would be (n+1)*( (n-1)/2 ) + (n+1)/2. Let's compute that:\n\n(n+1)*( (n-1)/2 ) + (n+1)/2 = (n+1)(n-1 + 1)/2 = (n+1)*n/2.\n\nSo, whether n is even or odd, the sum is n(n+1)/2. That seems to work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to think about it. I remember something about arithmetic series. The sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the number of terms multiplied by the average of the first and last terms. In this case, the number of terms is n, the first term is 1, and the last term is n. So, the sum should be n*(1 + n)/2, which is n(n+1)/2. That's another way to see it.\n\nBut let me try to derive it from scratch without relying on the formula for arithmetic series. Maybe using induction? Yeah, mathematical induction is a common method for proving statements like this.\n\nOkay, let's try induction. First, the base case: n=1. The sum is just 1, and the formula gives 1*(1+1)/2=1*2/2=1. So, it works for n=1.\n\nNow, assume that the formula holds for some integer k, meaning that 1 + 2 + ... + k = k(k+1)/2. Now, let's consider the case for k+1. The sum would be 1 + 2 + ... + k + (k+1). According to the induction hypothesis, the sum up to k is k(k+1)/2. So, adding (k+1) gives k(k+1)/2 + (k+1). Let's factor out (k+1):\n\n(k+1)*(k/2 + 1) = (k+1)*(k+2)/2.\n\nSo, the formula holds for k+1 if it holds for k. Therefore, by induction, the formula is valid for all positive integers n.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. So, using mathematical induction, I've shown that the formula holds for all n\u22651.\n\nAnother way I thought about it earlier was pairing the terms. Let me write that down again to make sure I didn't miss anything. So, S = 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n. If I write S backwards below it:\n\nS = n + (n-1) + (n-2) + ... + 2 + 1.\n\nNow, if I add these two equations together, term by term:\n\nS + S = (1 + n) + (2 + (n-1)) + (3 + (n-2)) + ... + ((n/2) + (n/2)) + ... + (n + 1).\n\nEach pair adds up to n+1, and there are n/2 such pairs if n is even. If n is odd, the middle term is (n+1)/2, but as I saw earlier, the total sum still ends up being n(n+1)/2.\n\nSo, whether n is even or odd, S = n(n+1)/2.\n\nI think that covers both methods: pairing and induction. Both lead to the same conclusion, so the formula holds for all integers n\u22651.\n\nWait, let me just test it with a small value to make sure. Let's take n=3. The sum is 1+2+3=6. According to the formula, 3*4/2=6. Yep, that works. Another test: n=4. Sum is 1+2+3+4=10. Formula: 4*5/2=10. Perfect.\n\nSo, I think I've covered the necessary steps to prove the formula using induction and pairing. Both methods reinforce the result, so I'm confident the proof is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe sum of the first n positive integers is given by the formula:  \n1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n = n(n+1)/2 for all integers n \u2265 1.\n\n**Proof:**\n\nWe can prove this formula using mathematical induction.\n\n**Base Case (n = 1):**  \nThe sum is 1.  \nAccording to the formula: 1(1+1)/2 = 1.  \nThus, the base case holds.\n\n**Inductive Step:**  \nAssume the formula holds for some integer k, i.e.,  \n1 + 2 + 3 + ... + k = k(k+1)/2.  \n\nWe need to show it holds for k + 1.  \nConsider the sum up to k + 1:  \n1 + 2 + 3 + ... + k + (k + 1).  \n\nUsing the induction hypothesis:  \nSum up to k: k(k+1)/2.  \nAdding (k + 1):  \nSum up to k + 1 = k(k+1)/2 + (k + 1).  \n\nFactor out (k + 1):  \n(k + 1)(k/2 + 1) = (k + 1)(k + 2)/2.  \n\nThus, the formula holds for k + 1.  \n\nBy the principle of mathematical induction, the formula holds for all integers n \u2265 1.  \n\n**Alternative Proof Using Pairing:**\n\nWrite the sum forwards and backwards:  \nS = 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n.  \nS = n + (n-1) + (n-2) + ... + 2 + 1.  \n\nAdding both equations:  \n2S = (1 + n) + (2 + (n-1)) + (3 + (n-2)) + ... + (n/2 + n/2) + ... + (n + 1).  \n\nEach pair sums to (n + 1), and there are n/2 such pairs if n is even.

Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this. I remember something about mathematical induction, maybe that's a good way to start. Or perhaps there's a simpler way using a visual method.\n\nFirst, let me write down what I know. The sum S = 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n. I need to show that this sum equals n(n+1)/2. I think induction is a solid approach here because it's a common method for proving formulas for sequences and series.\n\nOkay, so for mathematical induction, I need to prove two things: the base case and the inductive step. The base case is usually when n=1. Let's check that. If n=1, then S=1. Plugging into the formula, 1(1+1)/2 = 2/2 = 1. Yep, that works. So the base case holds.\n\nNow, for the inductive step. I need to assume that the formula holds for some integer k, meaning that 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + k = k(k+1)/2. Then, I need to show that the formula also holds for k+1, that is, 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + k + (k+1) equals (k+1)(k+2)/2.\n\nStarting with the left side: 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + k + (k+1). According to the induction hypothesis, the sum up to k is k(k+1)/2. So adding (k+1) to both sides, we get k(k+1)/2 + (k+1).\n\nHmm, let's factor out (k+1) from both terms. That would give (k+1)(k/2 + 1). Let me simplify that. k/2 + 1 is the same as (k + 2)/2. So now we have (k+1)(k+2)/2, which is exactly the formula for k+1. Therefore, the formula holds for k+1 if it holds for k.\n\nSince both the base case and the inductive step have been proven, by mathematical induction, the formula n(n+1)/2 is valid for all integers n \u2265 1. That seems to work.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about pairing terms. Like, if I write the sum forwards and backwards and add them together, maybe that helps. Let me try that.\n\nWrite S = 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n.\n\nWrite it again backwards: S = n + (n-1) + (n-2) + ... + 1.\n\nNow, add these two equations together:\n\n2S = (1 + n) + (2 + (n-1)) + (3 + (n-2)) + ... + (n + 1).\n\nEach pair adds up to (n + 1). There are n such pairs, so 2S = n(n + 1).\n\nTherefore, S = n(n + 1)/2. That's another way to see it without using induction, just by pairing the terms. That makes sense too.\n\nI think both methods are valid. Induction is more formal and relies on the principle of mathematical induction, which is a fundamental proof technique. The pairing method is more of an algebraic proof, manipulating the sum directly.\n\nWait, let me check with a small value to make sure. Let's say n=3. The sum is 1+2+3=6. Plugging into the formula, 3(4)/2=12/2=6. Correct. Another example, n=5: 1+2+3+4+5=15. Formula: 5*6/2=30/2=15. Yep, works.\n\nI think I've covered the main points. Both induction and pairing methods work, and I've verified with examples. So, the proof is solid.\n</think>\n\nThe sum of the first n positive integers is given by the formula:\n\n1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n = n(n+1)/2 for all integers n \u2265 1.\n\n**Proof by Mathematical Induction:**\n\n1. **Base Case (n = 1):**\n   \\[\n   S = 1\n   \\]\n   Plugging into the formula:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1(1 + 1)}{2} = 1\n   \\]\n   The base case holds.\n\n2. **Inductive Step:**\n   Assume the formula holds for some integer \\( k \\geq 1 \\):\n   \\[\n   1 + 2 + 3 + \\dots + k = \\frac{k(k + 1)}{2}\n   \\]\n   Consider \\( k + 1 \\):\n   \\[\n   1 + 2 + 3 + \\dots + k + (k + 1)\n   \\]\n   Using the induction hypothesis:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{k(k + 1)}{2} + (k + 1)\n   \\]\n   Factor out \\( (k + 1) \\):\n   \\[\n   (k + 1)\\left( \\frac{k}{2} + 1 \\right) = (k + 1)\\left( \\frac{k + 2}{2} \\right) = \\frac{(k + 1)(k + 2)}{2}\n   \\]\n   Thus, the formula holds for \\( k + 1 \\).\n\nBy induction, the formula is valid for all integers \\( n \\geq 1 \\).\n\n**Alternative Proof by Pairing:**\n\nWrite the sum forwards and backwards:\n\\[\nS = 1 + 2 + 3 + \\dots + n\n\\]\n\\[\nS = n + (n - 1) + (n - 2) + \\dots + 1\n\\]\nAdd the two equations:\n\\[\n2S = (1 + n) + (2 + (n - 1)) + (3 + (n - 2)) + \\dots + (n + 1)\n\\]\nEach pair sums to \\( n + 1 \\), and there are \\( n \\) pairs:\n\\[\n2S = n(n + 1)\n\\]\nThus:\n\\[\nS = \\frac{n(n + 1)}{2}\n\\]\nThis confirms the formula for all integers \\( n \\geq 1 \\).\n\n**Verification with Examples:**\n\n- For \\( n = 3 \\):\n  \\[\n  1 + 2 + 3 = 6 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{3 \\times 4}{2} = 6\n  \\]\n- For \\( n = 5 \\):\n  \\[\n  1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{5 \\times 6}{2} = 15\n  \\]\nBoth examples validate the formula.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe sum of the first \\( n \\) positive integers is indeed \\( \\frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \\) for all integers \\( n \\geq 1 \\).\n\nDONE."

Hmm, I remember learning about this in algebra. Let me think about how to approach this.

There are two steps: the base case and the inductive step. In the base case, I need to show that the formula holds for n=1. Then, in the inductive step, I assume it holds for some arbitrary integer k and show that it must then hold for k+1.\n\nStarting with the base case, n=1. The sum should be 1. Plugging into the formula: 1*(1+1)/2 = 2/2 = 1. Yep, that checks out. So the base case works.\n\nNow, for the inductive step. Let's assume that the formula works for n=k.

So, adding (k+1) to both sides, we get: k(k+1)/2 + (k+1). \n\nHmm, I can factor out (k+1): (k+1)(k/2 + 1). Let me simplify that. k/2 + 1 is the same as (k + 2)/2. So, the expression becomes (k+1)(k + 2)/2, which is exactly the formula for n=k+1. \n\nTherefore, by mathematical induction, the formula holds for all integers n \u2265 1. That seems solid.

Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this. I remember that there are a few methods to prove this formula. Maybe I can try induction because that seems like a common approach for proofs involving sequences and series.\n\nOkay, so mathematical induction has two main steps: the base case and the inductive step. First, I need to check if the formula holds true for n=1. Let's see, when n=1, the sum should be just 1, right? Plugging into the formula, n(n+1)/2 becomes 1*(1+1)/2, which is 2/2 = 1. That matches, so the base case is good.\n\nNow, for the inductive step, I assume that the formula works for some integer k, meaning that 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + k = k(k+1)/2. Then, I need to show that it also works for k+1, so the sum up to k+1 would be 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + k + (k+1). \n\nIf I take the sum up to k, which is k(k+1)/2, and add (k+1) to it, that should give me the sum up to k+1. So, k(k+1)/2 + (k+1). Hmm, I can factor out (k+1) from both terms, which gives (k+1)(k/2 + 1). Let me simplify that: (k+1)(k + 2)/2, because k/2 + 1 is the same as (k + 2)/2. So, that simplifies to (k+1)(k+2)/2, which is exactly the formula for n = k+1. Therefore, by induction, the formula holds for all positive integers n.\n\nWait, but is there another way to think about this? Maybe using a different method like visualizing it or using a diagram. I think Gauss came up with a clever trick where he pairs terms. Let's see, if I write the sum forwards and backwards:\n\n1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n\n\nand\n\nn + (n-1) + (n-2) + ... + 1\n\nIf I add these two equations together, term by term, each pair adds up to n+1. How many such pairs are there? Well, there are n terms in each list, so n pairs. So, n*(n+1) is the total when adding both sums. But the original sum is just one of those, so the sum must be half of n*(n+1), which is n(n+1)/2. That makes sense too.\n\nAnother way could be using the concept of arithmetic series. The sum of an arithmetic series is given by n/2*(first term + last term). Here, the first term is 1, and the last term is n. So, the sum is n/2*(1 + n) = n(n+1)/2. Yep, that's consistent.\n\nI think I've covered the main methods: induction, pairing terms, and using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. Each approach leads to the same conclusion, so the proof seems solid. I don't see any gaps or mistakes in my reasoning.

Hmm, okay. Let me try to think this through step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that this is called Gauss's famous pairing method or something like that. But maybe I should approach it more from the ground up, since I'm just starting to learn about this.\n\nLet me write down the sum: 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n. So, if I have, say, 5 numbers, it's 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5. I want to find a way to add these numbers together and show that it equals 5*6/2, which is 15. So, 1+2+3+4+5 should equal 15. Let me check that real quick: 1+2 is 3, plus 3 is 6, plus 4 is 10, plus 5 is 15. Yep, that works.\n\nBut how do I prove it for any n? Maybe I can use induction or some kind of pattern. Let me try induction first because I think that's a common method for proofs involving integers.\n\nOkay, so for induction, I need to show two things: the base case is true, and if it's true for some integer k, then it's also true for k+1.\n\nBase case: n=1. The sum is just 1, and 1*(1+1)/2 is 1*2/2 which is 1. So that checks out.\n\nNow, assume that for some integer k, the sum 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + k equals k(k+1)/2. That's my induction hypothesis.\n\nI need to show that 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + k + (k+1) equals (k+1)(k+2)/2.\n\nStarting from the left side: 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + k + (k+1). According to my hypothesis, the sum up to k is k(k+1)/2. So, adding (k+1) to both sides, I get k(k+1)/2 + (k+1).\n\nI can factor out (k+1): (k+1)(k/2 + 1). Let me compute that: (k+1)(k/2 + 1) = (k+1)( (k + 2)/2 ) = (k+1)(k+2)/2, which is the formula for k+1. So that works.\n\nTherefore, by induction, the formula holds for all positive integers n.\n\nWait, but I'm supposed to prove it, not just use induction. Maybe I can think of another way, like the pairing method. Let me try that.\n\nSo, writing the sum forwards and backwards:\n\n1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n\nn + (n-1) + (n-2) + ... + 1\n\nIf I add these two equations together, term by term, I get:\n\n(1 + n) + (2 + (n-1)) + (3 + (n-2)) + ... + ((n-1) + 2) + (n + 1).\n\nEach of these pairs adds up to (n + 1). How many such pairs are there? Well, from 1 to n, there are n terms, so when I pair them, I have n/2 pairs if n is even, or (n-1)/2 pairs plus the middle term if n is odd. Wait, but actually, when n is even, the number of pairs is n/2, each adding to (n+1). So the total sum would be (n/2)*(n+1). But if n is odd, there's a middle term which is (n+1)/2, and the rest form (n-1)/2 pairs, each adding to (n+1). So the total sum would be ((n-1)/2)*(n+1) + (n+1)/2 = (n+1)*(n)/2, which is the same as n(n+1)/2.\n\nWait, let me check that again. If n is even, say n=4: 1+2+3+4=10. Using the formula, 4*5/2=10. Correct. If n is 5: 1+2+3+4+5=15. Formula: 5*6/2=15. Correct.\n\nSo, in both cases, the sum is n(n+1)/2. So this pairing method works regardless of whether n is even or odd because when n is odd, the middle term is (n+1)/2, and the rest pair up to (n+1), so the total is (n/2)*(n+1) when n is even, and when n is odd, it's ((n-1)/2)*(n+1) + (n+1)/2 = (n+1)(n+1)/2 = n(n+1)/2. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me re-express that.\n\nWait, for n odd: Let's take n=5. The pairs are (1+5)=6, (2+4)=6, and the middle term is 3. So total sum is 6 + 6 + 3 = 15, which is 5*6/2=15. So each pair adds to (n+1), and the number of pairs is (n-1)/2 when n is odd, so the sum is (n-1)/2*(n+1) + (n+1)/2. Wait, that's (n+1)(n-1)/2 + (n+1)/2 = (n+1)(n-1 +1)/2 = (n+1)n/2, which is n(n+1)/2. So yes, that works.\n\nSo, in both cases, whether n is even or odd, the sum is n(n+1)/2. Therefore, the pairing method works.\n\nAnother way I thought of is using mathematical induction, which I already did, and that's a solid proof. So, combining both methods, I can confidently say that the sum of the first n positive integers is n(n+1)/2.\n</think>\n\nThe sum of the first n positive integers is proven to be n(n+1)/2 using both mathematical induction and the pairing method. \n\nDONE."

Hmm, I remember learning about this in algebra class. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let me write down what I know. The sum we're trying to find is 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n. So, that's the sum of all integers starting from 1 up to some number n. I need to find a formula that gives me this sum for any n \u2265 1.\n\nI think there are a few methods to prove this. One common method is mathematical induction. Another might be pairing terms or using a different approach like visual representation. Let me try induction because I remember it being a systematic way to prove statements for all natural numbers.\n\nAlright, so for mathematical induction, I need to follow two steps: the base case and the inductive step.\n\n**Base Case:** Let's start with n = 1. If n is 1, then the sum is just 1. Plugging into the formula, n(n+1)/2 becomes 1*2/2, which is 1. So, the base case holds true.\n\n**Inductive Step:** Now, let's assume that the formula works for some arbitrary positive integer k. That is, assume that 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + k = k(k+1)/2. This is our induction hypothesis.\n\nNow, I need to show that if the formula holds for n = k, it also holds for n = k + 1. That is, 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + k + (k + 1) should equal (k + 1)(k + 2)/2.\n\nStarting with the left side: 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + k + (k + 1). According to the induction hypothesis, the sum up to k is k(k+1)/2. So, adding (k + 1) to both sides gives:\n\nk(k+1)/2 + (k + 1)\n\nFactor out (k + 1):\n\n(k + 1)(k/2 + 1)\n\nSimplify inside the parentheses:\n\nk/2 + 1 = (k + 2)/2\n\nSo, the expression becomes:\n\n(k + 1)(k + 2)/2\n\nWhich is exactly the formula for n = k + 1. Therefore, by induction, the formula holds for all positive integers n.\n\nWait, but did I do that correctly? Let me double-check the algebra. When I factor out (k + 1), I have:\n\n(k(k + 1)/2) + (k + 1) = (k + 1)(k/2 + 1)\n\nYes, that seems right. Then, combining the terms inside the parentheses:\n\nk/2 + 1 = (k + 2)/2\n\nSo, (k + 1)(k + 2)/2, which is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of another method just to confirm. Sometimes, pairing the first and last terms helps. Let's try that.\n\nConsider the sum S = 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n.\n\nWrite the sum forwards and backwards:\n\nS = 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n\n\nS = n + (n - 1) + (n - 2) + ... + 1\n\nNow, add these two equations term by term:\n\n2S = (1 + n) + (2 + (n - 1)) + (3 + (n - 2)) + ... + (n + 1)\n\nEach pair adds up to n + 1. How many such pairs are there? Since there are n terms, there are n/2 pairs if n is even, but actually, each term in the first S pairs with a term in the second S, so for an odd n, the middle term is n + 1/2, but since we're dealing with integers, maybe it's better to think that each pair sums to n + 1, and there are n such pairs. Wait, no, that can't be right because the total number of terms is n.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me think again. When I add S and S, each term from the first S pairs with a term from the second S. For example, 1 pairs with n, 2 pairs with (n - 1), and so on. So, each pair sums to (1 + n), (2 + (n - 1)), etc. Each of these pairs sums to (n + 1). How many such pairs are there? Since there are n terms, and each pair uses two terms, the number of pairs is n/2. Wait, but that would only be the case if n is even. If n is odd, there's a middle term left, which is (n + 1)/2. Hmm, this might complicate things. Maybe I should consider both cases.\n\nWait, but when I add S and S, I get 2S = sum of all these paired terms. Let me write it out for clarity.\n\nFor n = 4:\n\nS = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10\n\nAdding S and S:\n\n2S = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 20\n\nWhich is correct because 2*10 = 20.\n\nNow, let's see the pairs: (1 + 4), (2 + 3) = 5 + 5 = 10, and then there's the middle term? Wait, no, for n=4, which is even, all terms pair up neatly without a middle term.\n\nWait, but in my earlier thought, I thought about n being odd, but in this example, n=4 is even. Let me try n=5.\n\nS = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15\n\nAdding S and S:\n\n2S = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 30\n\nWhich is 2*15=30.\n\nNow, the pairs: (1 +5), (2 +4), (3 +3) = 6 + 6 + 6 = 18. Wait, that's 18, but 2S=30. Hmm, that doesn't add up. Wait, no, I think I'm miscounting. Let me list them:\n\n(1 +5)=6, (2 +4)=6, (3 +3)=6. So that's three pairs, each summing to 6, so total 18. But 2S=30. So, where's the discrepancy?\n\nAh, I see. For n=5, when I write S and then reverse S, I have 10 terms, so when I add them, I get 2S=30. But when I pair them, I get 6 + 6 + 6, which is 18, but that's only 3 pairs, but 10 terms mean 5 pairs? Wait, no, 10 terms would mean 5 pairs, each summing to 6, which would give 30. Wait, that makes sense.\n\nWait, in the n=5 case, the reversed S is 5,4,3,2,1. So when I add S and reversed S, I have:\n\n1+5=6, 2+4=6, 3+3=6, 4+2=6, 5+1=6. Wait, that's five pairs, each summing to 6, so 5*6=30, which matches 2S=30. So, in general, for any n, when you add S and reversed S, you get 2S, and each pair sums to (n +1). How many pairs? For n terms, there are n terms in each S, so when you add them, you have 2n terms, which can be grouped into n pairs, each summing to (n +1). Therefore, 2S = n*(n +1), so S = n(n +1)/2.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, that's another way to see it without induction. By pairing the terms and adding the two sequences, you can find that 2S equals n(n +1), so S is n(n +1)/2.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the formula holds for all positive integers n.\n</think>\n\nThe sum of the first n positive integers is given by the formula:\n\n1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n = n(n+1)/2\n\n**Proof:**\n\nWe can prove this using mathematical induction.\n\n**Base Case (n = 1):**\nFor n = 1, the sum is 1. Plugging into the formula:\n1(1 + 1)/2 = 2/2 = 1. The base case holds.\n\n**Inductive Step:**\nAssume the formula holds for some integer k \u2265 1, i.e.,\n1 + 2 + 3 + ... + k = k(k + 1)/2.\n\nWe need to show it holds for k + 1, i.e.,\n1 + 2 + 3 + ... + k + (k + 1) = (k + 1)(k + 2)/2.\n\nStarting with the left side:\n1 + 2 + 3 + ... + k + (k + 1) = [k(k + 1)/2] + (k + 1) [by the induction hypothesis].\n\nFactor out (k + 1):\n= (k + 1)(k/2 + 1)\n= (k + 1)(k + 2)/2.\n\nThis equals the right side for n = k + 1. Thus, by induction, the formula holds for all n \u2265 1.\n\n**Alternative Method: Pairing Terms**\n\nConsider the sum S = 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n.\n\nWrite S forwards and backwards:\nS = 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n\nS = n + (n - 1) + (n - 2) + ... + 1\n\nAdding these:\n2S = (1 + n) + (2 + (n - 1)) + ... + (n + 1)\n\nEach pair sums to (n + 1), and there are n pairs:\n2S = n(n + 1)\nS = n(n + 1)/2.\n\nThus, the sum of the first n positive integers is n(n + 1)/2 for all integers n \u2265 1.\n\nDONE."

    "solution": "Solve this problem step by step. End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: Prove that the sum of the first n positive integers is given by the formula: 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n = n(n+1)/2 for all integers n \u2265 1. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I need to prove that the sum of the first n positive integers is equal to n(n+1)/2. Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that this formula is called Gauss's Triangular Number Theorem or something like that. I think Gauss figured this out when he was a kid or something. Anyway, the formula itself is pretty famous. But I need to actually prove it, not just state it.\n\nOkay, so let me start by writing out the sum. Let's say I have the numbers 1, 2, 3, ..., up to n. The sum S is 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n. I need to find a way to add these numbers and show that it equals n(n+1)/2.\n\nOne method I remember is pairing the terms from the start and end of the sequence. So, let's try that. If I write the sum forwards and backwards, I can add them together.\n\nSo, writing it out:\n\nS = 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + (n-1) + n\n\nAnd if I reverse the order:\n\nS = n + (n-1) + (n-2) + ... + 2 + 1\n\nNow, if I add these two equations together, term by term, I get:\n\n2S = (1 + n) + (2 + (n-1)) + (3 + (n-2)) + ... + ((n-1) + 2) + (n + 1)\n\nEach of these pairs adds up to (n + 1). Let me check that. The first term in the first sum is 1, and the last term in the second sum is 1, so 1 + 1 = 2. Wait, that's not quite right. Maybe I should think of it differently.\n\nActually, when you add the two equations, each pair (1 + n), (2 + (n-1)), etc., all add up to (n + 1). How many such pairs are there? Well, there are n terms in each sum, so when you add them, you have n pairs, each adding up to (n + 1). So, 2S = n*(n + 1). Therefore, S = n*(n + 1)/2.\n\nWait, let me make sure I did that correctly. So, if I have n terms, each pair sums to (n + 1), and there are n pairs, so 2S = n(n + 1). Then dividing both sides by 2 gives S = n(n + 1)/2. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nBut maybe I should try a small example to check. Let's say n=3. The sum is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6. Plugging into the formula, 3*(3+1)/2 = 12/2 = 6. That works.\n\nAnother example: n=4. Sum is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10. Formula: 4*5/2 = 20/2 = 10. Good.\n\nOkay, so the pairing method works. But is there another way to think about it? Maybe induction?\n\nLet's try mathematical induction. First, the base case: n=1. Sum is 1, formula gives 1*2/2 = 1. So it holds.\n\nNow, assume it holds for some integer k, that 1 + 2 + ... + k = k(k+1)/2. Now, for k+1, the sum is 1 + 2 + ... + k + (k+1). By the induction hypothesis, this is k(k+1)/2 + (k+1). Let's factor out (k+1): (k+1)(k/2 + 1) = (k+1)(k + 2)/2. Which is the formula for n = k+1. So it holds for k+1.\n\nTherefore, by induction, the formula holds for all positive integers n.\n\nHmm, that seems solid. Another approach could be using the concept of arithmetic series. The sum of an arithmetic series is (number of terms)/2 * (first term + last term). In this case, the number of terms is n, first term is 1, last term is n. So sum S = n/2 * (1 + n) = n(n + 1)/2. That's the same result.\n\nBut the induction method is more involved, while the pairing trick is quicker. I think the pairing method is more elegant here.\n\nWait, another thought: sometimes people use a visual representation with dots or stars and bars. For example, representing the sum as dots and then arranging them in a triangle. Each row has one more dot than the previous. The total number of dots is the sum, and the formula comes from counting the dots in a certain way. But I think that's similar to the pairing method.\n\nAnyway, I've checked the formula with examples and used two different methods: pairing and induction. Both seem to confirm the formula. So I think I've got it.\n</think>\n\nThe sum of the first n positive integers is given by the formula:\n\n1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n = n(n+1)/2\n\n**Proof:**\n\nWe can prove this formula using mathematical induction.\n\n**Base Case (n = 1):**\nThe sum is 1, and the formula gives 1(1 + 1)/2 = 1. Thus, the base case holds.\n\n**Inductive Step:**\nAssume the formula holds for some integer k, i.e.,\n1 + 2 + 3 + ... + k = k(k + 1)/2.\n\nWe need to show it holds for k + 1:\n1 + 2 + 3 + ... + k + (k + 1).\n\nUsing the inductive hypothesis:\n= k(k + 1)/2 + (k + 1)\n= (k + 1)(k/2 + 1)\n= (k + 1)(k + 2)/2.\n\nThus, the formula holds for k + 1.\n\nBy the principle of mathematical induction, the formula holds for all positive integers n.\n\n**Alternative Proof using Pairing:**\n\nConsider the sum S = 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n.\n\nWrite S forwards and backwards:\nS = 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + (n - 1) + n\nS = n + (n - 1) + (n - 2) + ... + 2 + 1\n\nAdding these two equations:\n2S = (1 + n) + (2 + (n - 1)) + (3 + (n - 2)) + ... + ((n - 1) + 2) + (n + 1)\n\nEach pair sums to (n + 1), and there are n such pairs:\n2S = n(n + 1)\nThus, S = n(n + 1)/2.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nFor all integers n \u2265 1, the sum of the first n positive integers is n(n + 1)/2.\n\nDONE."
