They decide to survey 400 randomly selected adults from the city, which has a population of 50,000 adults. The survey finds that 280 of the sampled adults have received the vaccine. If we want to construct a 95% confidence interval for the true proportion of vaccinated adults in the city, which of the following sampling methods would be most appropriate, and what is the margin of error for this estimate (rounded to three decimal places)? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out which sampling method is most appropriate for this problem and calculate the margin of error. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem is about estimating the proportion of adults in a city who have received a particular vaccine. The local health department surveyed 400 randomly selected adults, and out of those, 280 reported having received the vaccine. The city has a population of 50,000 adults. They want a 95% confidence interval for the true proportion.\n\nHmm, okay. So, this seems like a proportion estimation problem where we're trying to find the proportion of vaccinated adults in the entire city. Since the population is quite large (50,000), I think using a proportion sample might be more efficient than a simple random sample, especially if we're trying to estimate a proportion. \n\nWait, but actually, when estimating a proportion, a simple random sample is usually the best method because it provides an unbiased estimate. However, since the population is large, maybe they can use a method like cluster sampling or stratified sampling to make the survey more efficient. But I'm not sure if that's necessary here. Let's think.\n\nThe question is about the most appropriate sampling method. Since the population is large, a simple random sample of 400 adults should provide a good estimate. But sometimes, especially with proportions, using a proportionate sample can be more precise because it mirrors the population structure. Alternatively, if there's a lot of variability or if certain groups are underrepresented, stratified sampling might help. But the problem doesn't mention any such factors, so maybe a simple random sample is sufficient.\n\nOkay, so assuming they used a simple random sample of 400 adults. Now, to find the margin of error for a 95% confidence interval. I remember that the margin of error (E) is calculated using the formula:\n\nE = z * sqrt(p*(1-p)/n)\n\nWhere:\n- z is the z-score for the desired confidence level (95%).\n- p is the sample proportion.\n- n is the sample size.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the sample proportion. They found that 280 out of 400 have received the vaccine. So,\n\np = 280 / 400 = 0.7\n\nNext, the z-score for a 95% confidence interval. I think it's around 1.96, right? Because for a 95% CI, the z-score is approximately 1.96.\n\nNow, plug the numbers into the formula:\n\nE = 1.96 * sqrt(0.7*(1-0.7)/400)\n\nLet me compute the value inside the square root first.\n\n0.7*(1-0.7) = 0.7*0.3 = 0.21\n\nThen, 0.21 / 400 = 0.000525\n\nTake the square root of that:\n\nsqrt(0.000525) \u2248 0.02286\n\nNow, multiply by 1.96:\n\nE \u2248 1.96 * 0.02286 \u2248 0.0447\n\nSo, the margin of error is approximately 0.045 when rounded to three decimal places.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nCalculating p again: 280/400 = 0.7, that's correct.\n\nZ-score for 95% CI: yes, it's 1.96.\n\nThen, 0.7*0.3 = 0.21, correct.\n\n0.21 / 400 = 0.000525, correct.\n\nSquare root of 0.000525: Let me compute that more accurately.\n\n0.000525 is 5.25 x 10^-4.\n\nThe square root of 5.25 x 10^-4 is sqrt(5.25) x 10^-2.\n\nsqrt(5.25) is approximately 2.2913, so 2.2913 x 10^-2 = 0.022913.\n\nMultiply by 1.96: 1.96 * 0.022913 \u2248\n\nLet me compute 1.96 * 0.022913.\n\nFirst, 2 * 0.022913 = 0.045826\n\nSubtract 0.04 * 0.022913 = 0.00093652\n\nSo, 0.045826 - 0.00093652 \u2248 0.04489\n\nRounded to three decimal places, that's 0.045.\n\nSo, the margin of error is approximately 0.045.\n\nNow, regarding the sampling method. Since the population is large (50,000), a simple random sample of 400 should provide a good estimate. However, sometimes when estimating proportions, especially in large populations, a proportionate sample might be more efficient. But in this case, since they're using a random sample, that's the standard method. There's no mention of cluster sampling or stratification, so I think a simple random sample is appropriate.\n\nAlternatively, if they had used a cluster sampling approach, the margin of error might be larger because cluster samples can have more variability. Similarly, stratified sampling could potentially reduce the margin of error if the strata have different vaccination rates, but since we don't have that information, it's safer to assume a simple random sample was used.\n\nSo, the most appropriate method is a simple random sample, and the margin of error is approximately 0.045.\n</think>\n\nThe most appropriate sampling method for estimating the proportion of vaccinated adults in the city is a simple random sample. The calculated margin of error for a 95% confidence interval is 0.045.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe most appropriate sampling method is a simple random sample, and the margin of error is 0.045. \n\nDONE."

They decide to survey 400 randomly selected adults from the city, which has a population of 50,000 adults. The survey finds that 280 of the sampled adults have received the vaccine. If we want to construct a 95% confidence interval for the true proportion of vaccinated adults in the city, which of the following sampling methods would be most appropriate, and what is the margin of error for this estimate (rounded to three decimal places)? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I've got this problem here about estimating the proportion of adults in a city who have received a particular vaccine. The local health department is conducting a survey to figure this out. Let me try to break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem says they surveyed 400 randomly selected adults from a city with a total population of 50,000 adults. Out of these 400 people, 280 reported that they had received the vaccine. The goal is to construct a 95% confidence interval for the true proportion of vaccinated adults in the city. The question also asks which sampling method would be most appropriate and what the margin of error is, rounded to three decimal places.\n\nOkay, so let's start by understanding what we're dealing with. We have a sample proportion, and we want to estimate the proportion in the entire population. Since the population is 50,000, but the sample is only 400, it's a relatively small sample size. That might affect the confidence interval's accuracy.\n\nThe first thing I need to do is figure out the sample proportion. The sample proportion, usually denoted by \\( \\hat{p} \\), is the number of adults in the sample who received the vaccine divided by the total number of adults in the sample. So that would be:\n\n\\( \\hat{p} = \\frac{280}{400} \\)\n\nLet me compute that. 280 divided by 400 is 0.7. So, the sample proportion is 0.7, or 70%.\n\nNext, I remember that to construct a confidence interval for a proportion, we use the formula:\n\n\\( \\hat{p} \\pm E \\)\n\nWhere \\( E \\) is the margin of error. The margin of error is calculated using the formula:\n\n\\( E = z \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1 - \\hat{p})}{n}} \\)\n\nHere, \\( z \\) is the z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level, which is 95%. I need to find the z-score for 95% confidence. I recall that for a 95% confidence interval, the z-score is approximately 1.96. I think that's right because the 95% confidence interval for a proportion is typically around \u00b11.96 standard errors.\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers I have:\n\n- \\( \\hat{p} = 0.7 \\)\n- \\( n = 400 \\)\n- \\( z = 1.96 \\)\n\nNow, let's compute the standard error, which is the square root part:\n\n\\( \\sqrt{\\frac{0.7 \\times (1 - 0.7)}{400}} \\)\n\nCalculating inside the square root first:\n\n\\( 0.7 \\times 0.3 = 0.21 \\)\n\nThen, divide by 400:\n\n\\( \\frac{0.21}{400} = 0.000525 \\)\n\nNow, take the square root of that:\n\n\\( \\sqrt{0.000525} \\)\n\nLet me compute that. The square root of 0.000525. Hmm, I know that the square root of 0.25 is 0.5, and the square root of 0.0001 is 0.01. So, 0.000525 is between 0.0001 and 0.25. Let me compute it more accurately.\n\nAlternatively, I can write it as:\n\n\\( \\sqrt{0.000525} = \\sqrt{525 \\times 10^{-6}} = \\sqrt{525} \\times 10^{-3} \\)\n\nNow, \\( \\sqrt{525} \\) is approximately 22.912, because 22.912 squared is about 525. So, 22.912 times 10^{-3} is 0.022912.\n\nSo, the standard error is approximately 0.022912.\n\nNow, multiply that by the z-score:\n\n\\( E = 1.96 \\times 0.022912 \\)\n\nCalculating that:\n\n1.96 times 0.022912. Let me do this step by step.\n\nFirst, 1 times 0.022912 is 0.022912.\n\nThen, 0.96 times 0.022912. Let's compute 0.96 * 0.022912.\n\n0.96 * 0.02 = 0.0192\n\n0.96 * 0.002912 = let's compute 0.96 * 0.002 = 0.00192, and 0.96 * 0.000912 = approximately 0.00087752.\n\nAdding those together: 0.00192 + 0.00087752 \u2248 0.00279752.\n\nSo, adding the two parts together: 0.0192 + 0.00279752 \u2248 0.0220.\n\nSo, total E \u2248 0.022912 + 0.0220 \u2248 0.044912.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, no, that's not the correct way to add. Because 1.96 is 1 + 0.96, so the total E is 1*0.022912 + 0.96*0.022912.\n\nSo, 1 * 0.022912 = 0.022912\n\n0.96 * 0.022912 = let's compute that accurately.\n\n0.96 * 0.022912:\n\nLet me write it as 0.96 * 22.912e-3.\n\nCompute 22.912 * 0.96:\n\n22.912 * 0.96:\n\n22.912 * 0.96 = ?\n\nWell, 22.912 * 1 = 22.912\n\nMinus 22.912 * 0.04 = 0.91648\n\nSo, 22.912 - 0.91648 = 22.912 - 0.91648 = 22.0 (approximately) because 22.912 - 0.91648 is 22.0.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Let me compute it more accurately.\n\n22.912 * 0.96:\n\nBreak it down:\n\n22.912 * 0.96 = 22.912 * (1 - 0.04) = 22.912 - (22.912 * 0.04)\n\nCompute 22.912 * 0.04:\n\n22.912 * 0.04 = 0.91648\n\nSo, subtract that from 22.912:\n\n22.912 - 0.91648 = 22.0 (approximate) but let me compute it precisely:\n\n22.912 - 0.91648 = ?\n\n22.912 - 0.91648:\n\n22.912 - 0.9 = 22.012\n\nThen subtract 0.01648: 22.012 - 0.01648 = 21.99552\n\nSo, 22.912 * 0.96 = 21.99552\n\nTherefore, 0.96 * 0.022912 = 21.99552e-3 = 0.02199552\n\nSo, E = 1 * 0.022912 + 0.96 * 0.022912 = 0.022912 + 0.02199552 = 0.04490752\n\nSo, approximately 0.04490752. Rounding that to three decimal places, it would be 0.045.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the calculation because sometimes I might make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, I can use a calculator approach:\n\nCompute 1.96 * 0.022912.\n\nLet me write 1.96 as 2 - 0.04.\n\nSo, 2 * 0.022912 = 0.045824\n\nThen, subtract 0.04 * 0.022912 = 0.00091648\n\nSo, 0.045824 - 0.00091648 = 0.04490752\n\nYes, that's the same result as before. So, E \u2248 0.04490752, which is approximately 0.045 when rounded to three decimal places.\n\nWait, but 0.04490752 is 0.0449 when rounded to four decimal places, which would be 0.045 when rounded to three decimal places.\n\nSo, the margin of error is 0.045.\n\nNow, the next part is to determine which sampling method is most appropriate. The options are not provided, but I can infer based on the context.\n\nTypically, when estimating a proportion in a population, especially when the population is large relative to the sample size, a simple random sample is the most appropriate method. That's because it ensures that each individual in the population has an equal chance of being selected, which reduces bias and ensures that the sample is representative of the population.\n\nIn this case, the city has 50,000 adults, and the sample size is 400. Since 400 is much smaller than 50,000, a simple random sample would be ideal. Other methods like stratified sampling or cluster sampling might be used in some cases, but without any specific information about the population structure (like age, ethnicity, etc.), a simple random sample is the most straightforward and appropriate method.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Sample proportion \\( \\hat{p} = 0.7 \\)\n- Sample size \\( n = 400 \\)\n- Z-score for 95% confidence: 1.96\n- Standard error: \\( \\sqrt{\\frac{0.7 \\times 0.3}{400}} = 0.022912 \\)\n- Margin of error: \\( 1.96 \\times 0.022912 \u2248 0.045 \\)\n- Appropriate sampling method: Simple random sampling\n\nI think that covers everything the question is asking for. I should double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.\n\nLet me verify the standard error calculation again:\n\n\\( \\sqrt{\\frac{0.7 \\times 0.3}{400}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.21}{400}} = \\sqrt{0.000525} \\)\n\nAs I calculated earlier, \\( \\sqrt{0.000525} \u2248 0.022912 \\). That seems correct.\n\nAnd then the margin of error:\n\n1.96 * 0.022912 = 0.04490752 \u2248 0.045.\n\nYes, that checks out.\n\nSo, the confidence interval would be 0.7 \u00b1 0.045, which is (0.655, 0.745). But the question only asks for the margin of error, so 0.045 is the answer.\n\nAs for the sampling method, since it's a proportion estimation without any mentioned complexities in the population, simple random sampling is the way to go.\n\nI think I'm confident with this solution.\n</think>\n\nTo estimate the proportion of adults who have received the vaccine, a simple random sample is most appropriate. The margin of error for a 95% confidence interval is approximately 0.045.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe most appropriate sampling method is a simple random sample. The margin of error is **0.045**.\n\nDONE."

If we want to construct a 95% confidence interval for the true proportion of vaccinated adults in the city, which of the following sampling methods would be most appropriate, and what is the margin of error for this estimate (rounded to three decimal places)? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out which sampling method is most appropriate for this problem and calculate the margin of error. Let me start by understanding the question.\n\nWe have a city with 50,000 adults, and a health department wants to estimate the proportion who have received a particular vaccine. They surveyed 400 randomly selected adults and found that 280 received the vaccine. They want a 95% confidence interval for the true proportion. The question is about choosing the right sampling method and finding the margin of error.\n\nFirst, I recall that when dealing with proportions, especially for estimating a population proportion, simple random sampling is usually the best method because it gives the most accurate and unbiased estimates. It's also the most cost-effective and straightforward method. The other sampling methods mentioned, like cluster sampling or stratified sampling, might be useful in specific situations, such as when the population has distinct subgroups or when certain groups are hard to reach. But unless there's information suggesting that the population has such characteristics, simple random sampling is likely the most appropriate here.\n\nNext, I need to calculate the margin of error. To do that, I should use the formula for the confidence interval for a proportion. The formula is:\n\nMargin of Error (ME) = z * sqrt((p_hat * (1 - p_hat)) / n)\n\nWhere:\n- z is the z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level (95% here).\n- p_hat is the sample proportion.\n- n is the sample size.\n\nFirst, let's compute the sample proportion. There were 280 adults vaccinated out of 400 surveyed.\n\np_hat = 280 / 400 = 0.7\n\nNow, the confidence level is 95%, so the z-score needs to be found for 95% confidence. I remember that for a 95% confidence interval, the z-score is approximately 1.96. I should double-check that. Yes, the z-score for 95% confidence is indeed around 1.96 because it leaves 2.5% in each tail of the standard normal distribution.\n\nNext, plug the numbers into the margin of error formula:\n\nME = 1.96 * sqrt((0.7 * (1 - 0.7)) / 400)\n\nFirst, calculate the variance part:\n\n0.7 * (1 - 0.7) = 0.7 * 0.3 = 0.21\n\nThen, divide that by the sample size, n:\n\n0.21 / 400 = 0.000525\n\nNow, take the square root of that:\n\nsqrt(0.000525) \u2248 0.022690\n\nFinally, multiply by the z-score:\n\n1.96 * 0.022690 \u2248 0.0444\n\nSo, the margin of error is approximately 0.044 when rounded to three decimal places.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me redo the calculation step by step.\n\nCompute p_hat: 280/400 = 0.7, that's correct.\n\nCompute variance: 0.7*0.3 = 0.21. Divided by 400: 0.21 / 400 = 0.000525.\n\nSquare root: sqrt(0.000525). Let me calculate that more accurately.\n\n0.000525 is the same as 5.25 x 10^-4. The square root of that is approximately 0.022690, which is correct.\n\nThen, 1.96 * 0.022690: Let's compute that.\n\n1.96 * 0.022690. I can compute 2 * 0.022690 = 0.04538, then subtract 0.04 * 0.022690 = 0.0009076. So, 0.04538 - 0.0009076 = 0.0444724. Rounded to three decimal places is 0.044.\n\nYes, that seems right. So the margin of error is 0.044.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate sampling method is simple random sampling, and the margin of error is 0.044.\n</think>\n\nThe most appropriate sampling method is **simple random sampling**. The margin of error for the 95% confidence interval is **0.044**.\n\n**Answer:** Simple random sampling is most appropriate, and the margin of error is **0.044**.\n\nDONE."

Let me read it again and make sure I understand what's being asked.\n\nThe problem says that a local health department wants to estimate the proportion of adults in a city who have received a particular vaccine. They decide to survey 400 randomly selected adults from the city, which has a population of 50,000 adults. The survey found that 280 of these sampled adults have received the vaccine. Now, they want to construct a 95% confidence interval for the true proportion of vaccinated adults in the city. The question is asking which sampling method is most appropriate and what the margin of error is, rounded to three decimal places.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what a confidence interval is. A confidence interval gives an estimated range of values which could be likely to contain an unknown population parameter, the estimated proportion in this case. It's often used when we don't know the exact population proportion but want to estimate it with some level of confidence, usually 95% or 99%.\n\nThe formula for the confidence interval for a proportion is:\n\n\\[\n\\hat{p} \\pm z \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{\\hat{p}(1 - \\hat{p})}}{n} \\right)\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\(\\hat{p}\\) is the sample proportion\n- \\(z\\) is the z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level\n- \\(n\\) is the sample size\n\nSo, the first thing I need is the sample proportion. The survey found that 280 out of 400 adults have received the vaccine. Let me calculate that.\n\n\\[\n\\hat{p} = \\frac{280}{400} = 0.7\n\\]\n\nSo the sample proportion is 0.7, or 70%.\n\nNext, I need to find the z-score for a 95% confidence interval. The z-score is the number of standard deviations from the mean in a standard normal distribution. For a 95% confidence interval, I remember that the z-score is approximately 1.96. Let me confirm that. Yes, for 95% confidence, the z-score is about 1.96 because it covers about 95% of the data within one standard deviation on either side.\n\nNow, I need to compute the margin of error (ME). The formula for ME is:\n\n\\[\nME = z \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1 - \\hat{p})}{n}}\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n- \\(z = 1.96\\)\n- \\(\\hat{p} = 0.7\\)\n- \\(n = 400\\)\n\nFirst, calculate \\(\\hat{p}(1 - \\hat{p})\\):\n\n\\[\n0.7 \\times (1 - 0.7) = 0.7 \\times 0.3 = 0.21\n\\]\n\nNext, divide that by the sample size \\(n\\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{0.21}{400} = 0.000525\n\\]\n\nThen take the square root of that:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{0.000525} \\approx 0.02286\n\\]\n\nNow multiply by the z-score:\n\n\\[\n1.96 \\times 0.02286 \\approx 0.0447\n\\]\n\nSo, the margin of error is approximately 0.0447, which rounds to 0.045 when rounded to three decimal places.\n\nWait, but the question also asks about the most appropriate sampling method. The problem mentions that they surveyed 400 randomly selected adults. So, random sampling is already implied here. I think the key here is whether it's a simple random sample or some other method.\n\nIn the context of constructing a confidence interval, simple random sampling is usually the most appropriate because it ensures that each individual in the population has an equal chance of being selected, which is important for unbiased estimates. If they used a different method like stratified sampling or cluster sampling, the confidence interval calculations might be more complex, and they might not have the exact sample size of 400. Since the problem doesn't mention any other sampling method, simple random sampling is likely the intended approach.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the most appropriate sampling method is simple random sampling, and the margin of error is approximately 0.045.\n</think>\n\nThe most appropriate sampling method is simple random sampling. The margin of error is 0.045.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe most appropriate sampling method is simple random sampling. The margin of error is **0.045**.\n\nDONE."

If we want to construct a 95% confidence interval for the true proportion of vaccinated adults in the city, which of the following sampling methods would be most appropriate, and what is the margin of error for this estimate (rounded to three decimal places)? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this problem here about estimating the proportion of adults in a city who have received a particular vaccine. The local health department is conducting a survey to figure this out. They surveyed 400 randomly selected adults out of a total population of 50,000 adults. In the survey, 280 adults reported having received the vaccine. Now, the question is asking about constructing a 95% confidence interval for the true proportion of vaccinated adults in the city. It also wants to know which sampling method is most appropriate and the margin of error for this estimate, rounded to three decimal places.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what kind of sampling method is most appropriate here. The options aren't given, but typically for proportions, the most common methods are simple random sampling, stratified sampling, cluster sampling, or maybe even convenience sampling. But since the problem mentions a random sample of 400 adults from a population of 50,000, I'm going to assume it's a simple random sampling because that's the most straightforward method when the population is large and the sample size is proportionate.\n\nOkay, so moving on. I need to construct a 95% confidence interval. For that, I remember that the formula for the margin of error (E) in a proportion is given by:\n\nE = z * sqrt((p_hat * (1 - p_hat)) / n)\n\nWhere:\n- z is the z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level.\n- p_hat is the sample proportion.\n- n is the sample size.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the sample proportion, p_hat. The sample found that 280 out of 400 adults have received the vaccine. So:\n\np_hat = 280 / 400 = 0.7\n\nSo, p_hat is 0.7. Now, the population size is 50,000, but since we're dealing with proportions, the population size might not matter as much unless we were using a method that requires it, like cluster sampling. But since we're using simple random sampling, we can proceed with the proportion formula.\n\nNext, we need the z-score for a 95% confidence interval. I remember that for a 95% confidence interval, the z-score is approximately 1.96. I think this is because the 95% confidence interval corresponds to the middle 95% of the sampling distribution, and the z-score is found from the standard normal distribution where the area under the curve to the left of z is 0.025 (since 5% is in each tail).\n\nSo, z = 1.96.\n\nNow, plugging into the margin of error formula:\n\nE = 1.96 * sqrt((0.7 * (1 - 0.7)) / 400)\n\nFirst, calculate the variance part:\n\n0.7 * (1 - 0.7) = 0.7 * 0.3 = 0.21\n\nThen, divide by n, which is 400:\n\n0.21 / 400 = 0.000525\n\nNow, take the square root of that:\n\nsqrt(0.000525) \u2248 0.02268\n\nMultiply by the z-score:\n\n1.96 * 0.02268 \u2248 0.0445\n\nSo, the margin of error is approximately 0.0445, which rounds to 0.045 when rounded to three decimal places.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, p_hat is 0.7, correct. The z-score for 95% is indeed 1.96. The formula looks right. Let me recalculate the variance:\n\n0.7 * 0.3 = 0.21, correct. Divided by 400: 0.21 / 400 = 0.000525. Square root: sqrt(0.000525). Let me compute that more accurately. 0.000525 is 5.25e-4. The square root of that is sqrt(5.25e-4). Since sqrt(5.25) is about 2.291, and sqrt(1e-4) is 0.01, so multiplying them gives 2.291 * 0.01 \u2248 0.02291. So, approximately 0.02291.\n\nThen, multiply by 1.96: 1.96 * 0.02291 \u2248 Let's do 1.96 * 0.02 = 0.0392, and 1.96 * 0.00291 \u2248 0.0057. Adding them together: 0.0392 + 0.0057 \u2248 0.0449. So, about 0.0449, which rounds to 0.045.\n\nSo, the margin of error is approximately 0.045.\n\nNow, about the sampling method. Since the problem mentions a random sample of 400 adults from a population of 50,000, the most appropriate method is simple random sampling. This method ensures that each individual in the population has an equal chance of being selected, which is important for unbiased estimates. Stratified sampling might be more appropriate if there are subgroups within the population that have different vaccination rates, but since the problem doesn't mention any such information, simple random sampling is sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, if the population is hard to reach or if there's concern about representativeness, cluster sampling might be used, where the population is divided into clusters and a random sample is taken from each cluster. However, without specific information about clustering, simple random sampling is more straightforward and likely what is intended here.\n\nTherefore, the sampling method is simple random sampling, and the margin of error is approximately 0.045.\n</think>\n\nThe most appropriate sampling method for this scenario is **simple random sampling**. This method ensures each adult in the city has an equal chance of being selected, providing a fair representation of the population. The margin of error for the 95% confidence interval is calculated as follows:\n\n1. **Sample Proportion (p_hat)**: 280/400 = 0.7\n2. **Z-score (z)**: 1.96 (for a 95% confidence interval)\n3. **Margin of Error (E)**:\n   - Variance: (0.7 * 0.3) / 400 = 0.000525\n   - Standard Error: sqrt(0.000525) \u2248 0.02291\n   - Margin of Error: 1.96 * 0.02291 \u2248 0.0449, which rounds to 0.045.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe appropriate sampling method is simple random sampling, and the margin of error is 0.045.\n\nDONE."

Let me try to work through this step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem states that a local health department wants to estimate the proportion of vaccinated adults in a city. They surveyed 400 randomly selected adults out of a population of 50,000. The survey found that 280 of these adults had received the vaccine. They want to construct a 95% confidence interval for the true proportion. The question is asking which sampling method is most appropriate and what the margin of error is, rounded to three decimal places.\n\nAlright, let me break this down. I think this is a confidence interval problem, specifically for proportions. I remember that when dealing with proportions, we usually use the formula for the confidence interval of a proportion, which is:\n\n\\[\n\\hat{p} \\pm E\n\\]\n\nWhere \\(\\hat{p}\\) is the sample proportion and \\(E\\) is the margin of error. The margin of error can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\nE = z \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1 - \\hat{p})}{n}}\n\\]\n\nHere, \\(z\\) is the z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level, which is 95% in this case. For 95%, I think the z-score is about 1.96. Let me confirm that. Yes, the z-score for a 95% confidence interval is indeed approximately 1.96.\n\nSo, first, I need to calculate the sample proportion, \\(\\hat{p}\\). The sample size \\(n\\) is 400, and the number of successes \\(X\\) is 280. So,\n\n\\[\n\\hat{p} = \\frac{X}{n} = \\frac{280}{400} = 0.7\n\\]\n\nOkay, so the sample proportion is 0.7. Now, let's plug this into the margin of error formula. But before that, I should check if the sample size is large enough for the normal approximation. I remember that for proportions, a good rule of thumb is that if \\(n \\geq 10\\), the normal approximation is reasonable. Here, \\(n = 400\\), which is way larger than 10, so we're good to go.\n\nNow, plugging the numbers into the margin of error formula:\n\n\\[\nE = 1.96 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{0.7 \\times (1 - 0.7)}{400}} = 1.96 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{0.7 \\times 0.3}{400}}\n\\]\n\nCalculating the numerator inside the square root first:\n\n\\[\n0.7 \\times 0.3 = 0.21\n\\]\n\nSo now,\n\n\\[\nE = 1.96 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{0.21}{400}} = 1.96 \\times \\sqrt{0.000525}\n\\]\n\nLet me compute \\(\\sqrt{0.000525}\\). Hmm, let's see. I know that \\(0.000525\\) is the same as \\(5.25 \\times 10^{-4}\\). Taking the square root of that would be approximately 0.02286. Let me double-check that calculation.\n\nWait, let me compute it more accurately. The square of 0.0228 is approximately 0.000518, which is close to 0.000525. So, maybe 0.0229 squared is 0.000522, and 0.02286 squared is about 0.000524. So, I think I can take \\(\\sqrt{0.000525} \\approx 0.02286\\).\n\nNow, multiplying this by the z-score:\n\n\\[\nE = 1.96 \\times 0.02286 \\approx 0.0449\n\\]\n\nRounding this to three decimal places, the margin of error is approximately 0.045.\n\nWait, let me check the calculation again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 0.7 times 0.3 is indeed 0.21. Divided by 400 gives 0.000525. The square root of that is approximately 0.02286. Multiplying by 1.96 gives 0.0449, which rounds to 0.045.\n\nSo, the margin of error is 0.045.\n\nNow, the question also asks which sampling method is most appropriate. The problem mentions that they surveyed 400 randomly selected adults. So, I think this is a simple random sample because the adults were selected randomly without any specific stratification or weighting. So, a simple random sample is the most appropriate here.\n\nLet me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The sample size is 400, which is a good size for a proportion estimation. The confidence level is 95%, so we used the z-score for 95%, which is 1.96. Calculated the sample proportion as 0.7, then used the margin of error formula, which gave us approximately 0.045.\n\nI don't think I made any calculation errors here. The steps seem correct: calculate the sample proportion, determine the margin of error using the z-score and the formula, and note that the sampling method was a simple random sample because the selection was random without any mentioned complications.\n\nSo, the answer is that a simple random sample is most appropriate, and the margin of error is 0.045.\n</think>\n\nThe most appropriate sampling method for this scenario is a simple random sample because the survey was conducted on a randomly selected group of adults without any specific stratification or weighting. \n\nThe margin of error for the 95% confidence interval is calculated as follows:\n\n1. Calculate the sample proportion: \\(\\hat{p} = \\frac{280}{400} = 0.7\\).\n2. Use the margin of error formula: \\(E = z \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1 - \\hat{p})}{n}}\\).\n3. Plug in the values: \\(E = 1.96 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{0.7 \\times 0.3}{400}} \\approx 0.045\\).\n\nDONE."

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem states that the local health department is surveying 400 randomly selected adults out of a population of 50,000. They found that 280 of these adults have received the vaccine. They want to construct a 95% confidence interval for the true proportion of vaccinated adults.\n\nOkay, so the goal is to estimate a proportion. Since the population is large (50,000), but the sample size is 400, I need to consider whether this sample is representative and if there's any reason to think it might not be. But the problem doesn't mention any issues with the sample, so I can assume it's a random sample.\n\nNow, the question is about choosing the appropriate sampling method. The options aren't provided, but I know that for estimating proportions, especially in large populations, simple random sampling is commonly used because it ensures each individual has an equal chance of being selected. This minimizes bias and reduces the variance of the estimate.\n\nHowever, sometimes when the population is very large, it might be impractical to survey everyone, so they might use other methods like cluster sampling or stratified sampling. But without more information, simple random sampling seems like the most straightforward and appropriate method here.\n\nNext, I need to calculate the margin of error for a 95% confidence interval. To do this, I'll use the formula for the confidence interval of a proportion:\n\nMargin of Error (E) = z * sqrt(p*(1-p)/n)\n\nWhere:\n- z is the z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level (95%).\n- p is the sample proportion.\n- n is the sample size.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the sample proportion. The number of adults who received the vaccine is 280, and the total sample size is 400.\n\np = 280 / 400 = 0.7\n\nNext, I need the z-score for a 95% confidence interval. For a 95% CI, the z-score is approximately 1.96 because this value covers about 95% of the normal distribution curve.\n\nNow, plug the values into the margin of error formula:\n\nE = 1.96 * sqrt(0.7 * (1 - 0.7) / 400)\n\nFirst, calculate the variance part:\n\n0.7 * (1 - 0.7) = 0.7 * 0.3 = 0.21\n\nThen divide by the sample size, n = 400:\n\n0.21 / 400 = 0.000525\n\nNow take the square root of that:\n\nsqrt(0.000525) \u2248 0.02268\n\nFinally, multiply by the z-score:\n\n1.96 * 0.02268 \u2248 0.0445\n\nSo, the margin of error is approximately 0.0445, which rounded to three decimal places is 0.045.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nCalculating p again: 280/400 = 0.7, that's correct.\n\nCalculating the variance: 0.7*0.3 = 0.21, divided by 400 gives 0.000525. Square root of that is indeed approximately 0.02268.\n\nThen, multiplying by 1.96: 1.96 * 0.02268. Let me do this more accurately.\n\n1.96 * 0.02268:\n\nFirst, 2 * 0.02268 = 0.04536\n\nBut since it's 1.96, which is 2 - 0.04, so subtract 0.04 * 0.02268.\n\n0.04 * 0.02268 = 0.0009072\n\nSo, 0.04536 - 0.0009072 = 0.04445\n\nRounded to three decimal places, that's 0.044, which is approximately 0.044.\n\nWait, earlier I got 0.0445, now I'm getting 0.044. Hmm, maybe I should use a calculator for more precision.\n\nLet me calculate 1.96 * 0.02268.\n\n1.96 * 0.02268:\n\nMultiply 1.96 by 0.02 = 0.0392\n\nMultiply 1.96 by 0.00268:\n\nFirst, 1.96 * 0.002 = 0.00392\n\nThen, 1.96 * 0.00068 = approximately 0.0013368\n\nSo, 0.00392 + 0.0013368 \u2248 0.0052568\n\nAdd that to 0.0392: 0.0392 + 0.0052568 \u2248 0.0444568\n\nSo, approximately 0.0445, which rounds to 0.045.\n\nWait, so earlier I thought it was 0.044, but now it's 0.0445, which is closer to 0.045. So, the margin of error is 0.045.\n\nTherefore, the appropriate sampling method is simple random sampling, and the margin of error is 0.045.\n\nI think that's it. Simple random sampling is best because it gives an unbiased estimate and is straightforward for estimating proportions. The calculations for the margin of error seem correct upon double-checking.\n</think>\n\nThe most appropriate sampling method for estimating the proportion of vaccinated adults is **simple random sampling**.

The options aren't provided, but I can think through the methods I know. The main sampling methods are random sampling, stratified sampling, cluster sampling, convenience sampling, etc. Each has its pros and cons.\n\nGiven that the population is 50,000 adults, and they're surveying 400, which is a fraction of the total. The sample size seems reasonable for a proportion estimation. Now, the key here is that they want a confidence interval for the true proportion. So, this sounds like a case for using a proportion confidence interval, which is typically constructed using the formula:\n\n$$\n\\hat{p} \\pm E\n$$\n\nWhere \\(\\hat{p}\\) is the sample proportion, and \\(E\\) is the margin of error.

The problem mentions they surveyed 400 randomly selected adults. That suggests they used random sampling. However, sometimes other methods might be more appropriate depending on the population characteristics.\n\nIf the population has subgroups or strata (like different age groups, genders, etc.), stratified sampling might provide more precise estimates. If the population is clustered in certain areas, cluster sampling could be used. But without specific information about the population's structure, random sampling is the most straightforward and appropriate method here.\n\nAdditionally, since they're estimating a proportion, simple random sampling is sufficient unless there's a known bias or specific characteristics that make another method more suitable. There's no mention of any such issues, so I think random sampling is the way to go.\n\nSo, to sum up, the appropriate sampling method is random sampling, and the margin of error is approximately 0.045.\n</think>\n\nThe most appropriate sampling method for this scenario is **random sampling** because it provides a representative sample from the population without specific clustering or stratification, which is necessary for estimating a proportion. \n\nThe margin of error for the 95% confidence interval is calculated as follows:\n\n1. **Sample Proportion (\\(\\hat{p}\\))**:\n   $$\n   \\hat{p} = \\frac{280}{400} = 0.7\n   $$\n\n2. **Margin of Error (\\(E\\))**:\n   $$\n   E = 1.96 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{0.7 \\times 0.3}{400}} = 1.96 \\times \\sqrt{0.000525} \\approx 0.045\n   $$\n\n**Answer:** The appropriate sampling method is random sampling, and the margin of error is 0.045.

They decide to survey 400 randomly selected adults from the city, which has a population of 50,000 adults. The survey finds that 280 of the sampled adults have received the vaccine. If we want to construct a 95% confidence interval for the true proportion of vaccinated adults in the city, which of the following sampling methods would be most appropriate, and what is the margin of error for this estimate (rounded to three decimal places)? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out which sampling method is most appropriate for estimating the proportion of vaccinated adults in the city, and then find the margin of error for a 95% confidence interval. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem says that the health department surveyed 400 randomly selected adults out of a population of 50,000. They found that 280 of these adults had received the vaccine. So, the sample proportion, which I'll call \\( \\hat{p} \\), is 280 divided by 400. Let me calculate that:\n\n\\( \\hat{p} = \\frac{280}{400} = 0.7 \\)\n\nOkay, so the sample proportion is 0.7. Now, they want to construct a 95% confidence interval for the true proportion of vaccinated adults in the entire city. To do this, I think I need to use the formula for the margin of error, which is:\n\n\\( E = z \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1 - \\hat{p})}{n}} \\)\n\nWhere:\n- \\( E \\) is the margin of error,\n- \\( z \\) is the z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level,\n- \\( \\hat{p} \\) is the sample proportion,\n- \\( n \\) is the sample size.\n\nBut before I can compute the margin of error, I need to decide on the sampling method. The options aren't provided, but I should think about which method is best suited for estimating a proportion. \n\nI recall that for proportions, the most appropriate sampling method is usually a simple random sample. This is because it ensures that each individual in the population has an equal chance of being selected, which reduces selection bias. Other methods like stratified sampling or cluster sampling might be used in certain situations, but without specific information about the population's structure, a simple random sample is likely the best choice.\n\nAssuming that a simple random sample was used, I can proceed with calculating the margin of error. Let's note the values:\n\n- \\( \\hat{p} = 0.7 \\)\n- \\( n = 400 \\)\n- The confidence level is 95%, so I need the z-score for 95% confidence. From the standard normal distribution, the z-score for 95% is approximately 1.96.\n\nNow, plugging these into the margin of error formula:\n\n\\( E = 1.96 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{0.7(1 - 0.7)}{400}} \\)\n\nFirst, calculate the variance part:\n\n\\( 0.7 \\times 0.3 = 0.21 \\)\n\nSo,\n\n\\( \\frac{0.21}{400} = 0.000525 \\)\n\nThen take the square root:\n\n\\( \\sqrt{0.000525} \\approx 0.02286 \\)\n\nNow multiply by the z-score:\n\n\\( 1.96 \\times 0.02286 \\approx 0.0447 \\)\n\nSo, the margin of error is approximately 0.0447, which rounds to 0.045 when rounded to three decimal places.\n\nWait, but I should double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me recalculate the variance:\n\n\\( 0.7 \\times 0.3 = 0.21 \\) \u2013 that's correct.\n\nThen,\n\n\\( 0.21 / 400 = 0.000525 \\) \u2013 yes, that's right.\n\nSquare root of 0.000525: Let me compute this more precisely. \n\nI know that \\( \\sqrt{0.00025} = 0.0158 \\), and \\( \\sqrt{0.000576} = 0.024, since \\( 0.024^2 = 0.000576 \\). But 0.000525 is between these two. Let me use a calculator approach.\n\nLet me write it as 525 x 10^-6. So, sqrt(525 x 10^-6). \n\nsqrt(525) is approximately 22.91, so sqrt(525 x 10^-6) = 22.91 x 10^-3 = 0.02291.\n\nYes, so 0.02291. Then, multiplying by 1.96:\n\n1.96 * 0.02291 \u2248 0.0447, which is about 0.045 when rounded.\n\nSo, the margin of error is 0.045.\n\nAlternatively, if I use more precise calculations, maybe it's slightly different, but I think 0.045 is accurate enough to three decimal places.\n\nI think that's it. The appropriate sampling method is a simple random sample, and the margin of error is approximately 0.045.\n</think>\n\nThe most appropriate sampling method for estimating the proportion of vaccinated adults is a simple random sample.

    "solution": "Solve this problem step by step. End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: A local health department wants to estimate the proportion of adults in a city who have received a particular vaccine. They decide to survey 400 randomly selected adults from the city, which has a population of 50,000 adults. The survey finds that 280 of the sampled adults have received the vaccine. If we want to construct a 95% confidence interval for the true proportion of vaccinated adults in the city, which of the following sampling methods would be most appropriate, and what is the margin of error for this estimate (rounded to three decimal places)? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out which sampling method is most appropriate for this problem and calculate the margin of error. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem is about estimating the proportion of adults in a city who have received a particular vaccine. The health department surveyed 400 randomly selected adults, and out of those, 280 reported having received the vaccine. The city has a population of 50,000 adults.\n\nThey want a 95% confidence interval for the true proportion. So, I think this is a proportion estimation problem using a confidence interval. The key here is to decide whether to use a simple random sample or some other method.\n\nGiven that the sample size is 400 and the population is 50,000, I remember that for proportion problems, if the sample size is less than 5% of the population, some people might use the finite population correction factor. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think.\n\nThe formula for the confidence interval for a proportion is:\n\n\\[\n\\hat{p} \\pm \\left( \\frac{z_{\\alpha/2}}{\\sqrt{n \\hat{p} (1 - \\hat{p})}} \\right)\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\(\\hat{p}\\) is the sample proportion\n- \\(z_{\\alpha/2}\\) is the z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level\n- \\(n\\) is the sample size\n\nFirst, let's calculate the sample proportion. \n\n\\[\n\\hat{p} = \\frac{280}{400} = 0.7\n\\]\n\nNext, the desired confidence level is 95%, so \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\). The z-score for 95% confidence is 1.96.\n\nNow, the population size is 50,000. The sample size is 400, which is 0.8% of the population (400/50,000 = 0.008). Since 0.8% is less than 5%, some might argue for using the finite population correction. The correction factor is \\( \\frac{N}{N - n} \\), where \\(N\\) is the population size.\n\nSo, the adjusted formula would be:\n\n\\[\n\\hat{p} \\pm \\left( \\frac{z_{\\alpha/2}}{\\sqrt{n \\hat{p} (1 - \\hat{p})} \\times \\frac{N}{N - n}} \\right)\n\\]\n\nBut wait, I'm not entirely sure if this is necessary here. In many cases, if the population is large relative to the sample size, the finite population correction isn't critical. Since 50,000 is quite large, and 400 is small relative to it, maybe the simple random sample without the correction is sufficient. However, to be thorough, perhaps I should consider both methods.\n\nLet me first calculate it without the correction.\n\nThe margin of error (ME) is the value added and subtracted from the sample proportion. So,\n\n\\[\nME = \\frac{z_{0.975}}{\\sqrt{n \\hat{p} (1 - \\hat{p})}} = \\frac{1.96}{\\sqrt{400 \\times 0.7 \\times 0.3}} \n\\]\n\nCalculating the denominator:\n\n400 * 0.7 = 280\n280 * 0.3 = 84\nSo sqrt(84) \u2248 9.165\n\nThen ME = 1.96 / 9.165 \u2248 0.2136\n\nSo, about 0.214, or 21.4%.\n\nNow, if I include the finite population correction:\n\nME = 1.96 / (sqrt(84) * (50000 / (50000 - 400))) = 1.96 / (9.165 * (50000 / 49900))\n\nCalculating 50000 / 49900 \u2248 1.002004\n\nSo, 9.165 * 1.002004 \u2248 9.172\n\nThen ME \u2248 1.96 / 9.172 \u2248 0.2138, which is almost the same as without the correction. So, the difference is negligible here, about 0.0002. Therefore, it's probably fine to use the simple random sample method without the finite population correction.\n\nBut wait, the question is asking which sampling method is most appropriate. So, I think they are referring to whether to use simple random sampling or some other method like cluster sampling or stratified sampling.\n\nGiven that they surveyed 400 randomly selected adults, that suggests a simple random sample. But maybe another method is more appropriate? For proportions, simple random sampling is usually the best unless there's some stratification or clustering that can be done to improve accuracy.\n\nHowever, the question doesn't mention anything about clustering or stratification, so I think simple random sampling is the way to go.\n\nSo, the sampling method is simple random sampling, and the margin of error is approximately 0.214, which rounds to 0.214.\n\nWait, let me double-check the calculations.\n\nSample size n = 400, sample proportion p\u0302 = 0.7.\n\nConfidence level 95%, z = 1.96.\n\nVariance of p\u0302 is p\u0302(1 - p\u0302)/n = 0.7*0.3/400 = 0.21/400 = 0.000525.\n\nStandard error = sqrt(0.000525) \u2248 0.02286\n\nThen ME = z * SE = 1.96 * 0.02286 \u2248 0.0447\n\nWait, that's different from what I got earlier. Oh no, I think I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, no, the standard error is sqrt(p\u0302(1 - p\u0302)/n). So 0.7*0.3 = 0.21, divided by 400 is 0.000525. Square root of that is approximately 0.02286. Then ME = 1.96 * 0.02286 \u2248 0.0447.\n\nWait, that's about 0.045, not 0.214. So I think I messed up the calculation earlier. Let me recalculate.\n\nYes, I think I confused the formula. The correct formula is:\n\nME = z / sqrt(n p\u0302 (1 - p\u0302)).\n\nSo, plugging in:\n\nz = 1.96\n\nn = 400\n\np\u0302 = 0.7\n\nSo,\n\nME = 1.96 / sqrt(400 * 0.7 * 0.3) = 1.96 / sqrt(84) \u2248 1.96 / 9.165 \u2248 0.2136.\n\nWait, that's about 0.2136, which is about 0.214.\n\nBut earlier when I did it step by step, I got 0.0447. That's because I was using the variance as 0.000525, which is correct, but then multiplying by z gives 0.0447.\n\nWait, no, that's conflicting. Let me clarify.\n\nThe standard error (SE) is sqrt(p\u0302(1 - p\u0302)/n) = sqrt(0.7*0.3/400) = sqrt(0.21/400) = sqrt(0.000525) \u2248 0.02286.\n\nThen, the margin of error is z * SE = 1.96 * 0.02286 \u2248 0.0447.\n\nBut earlier, when I calculated ME as z / sqrt(n p\u0302 (1 - p\u0302)), that's the same as z / sqrt(n p\u0302 (1 - p\u0302)) = 1.96 / sqrt(84) \u2248 0.2136.\n\nWait, but sqrt(n p\u0302 (1 - p\u0302)) is sqrt(84) \u2248 9.165, so 1.96 / 9.165 \u2248 0.2136.\n\nSo, which is correct? I think both are correct, but they represent different things.\n\nWait, no, the margin of error is z * SE, which is 0.0447, not 0.2136.\n\nI think I confused the formula earlier. Let me correct this.\n\nThe correct formula is:\n\nME = z * sqrt(p\u0302(1 - p\u0302)/n)\n\nWhich is 1.96 * sqrt(0.7*0.3/400) = 1.96 * sqrt(0.000525) \u2248 1.96 * 0.02286 \u2248 0.0447.\n\nSo, the margin of error is approximately 0.045.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 0.214. So I must have messed up the formula.\n\nI think I confused the formula with the one for a small population. Let me clarify.\n\nThe formula for the confidence interval for a proportion is:\n\n\\[\n\\hat{p} \\pm \\frac{z}{\\sqrt{n \\hat{p} (1 - \\hat{p})}}\n\\]\n\nSo, the margin of error is \\(\\frac{z}{\\sqrt{n \\hat{p} (1 - \\hat{p})}}\\).\n\nWhich is 1.96 / sqrt(84) \u2248 0.2136, or 0.214.\n\nBut when I do it as z * SE, it's 1.96 * 0.02286 \u2248 0.0447.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because 0.0447 is much smaller than 0.214. There's a discrepancy here.\n\nI think the confusion arises because the finite population correction is a factor when the population is not very large compared to the sample size. But in this case, the population is 50,000 and the sample is 400, so the finite population correction is minimal, as we saw earlier.\n\nBut the main confusion is between the two methods: using the simple formula versus the finite population correction. However, the key is that the formula without the correction gives ME \u2248 0.214, and with the correction, it's almost the same.\n\nBut when I calculate the standard error, it's 0.02286, and multiplying by z gives ME \u2248 0.0447, which is about half of 0.214.\n\nWait, no, that can't be. I think I'm mixing up two different formulas.\n\nWait, no, the formula is ME = z / sqrt(n p\u0302 (1 - p\u0302)), which is the same as z * sqrt(p\u0302(1 - p\u0302)/n), because:\n\nz / sqrt(n p\u0302 (1 - p\u0302)) = z * sqrt(1/(n p\u0302 (1 - p\u0302))) = z * sqrt(p\u0302(1 - p\u0302)/n) * sqrt(1/(p\u0302(1 - p\u0302))) * sqrt(1/(p\u0302(1 - p\u0302)))\n\nWait, that seems convoluted. Let me just confirm with numbers.\n\nCompute sqrt(n p\u0302 (1 - p\u0302)) = sqrt(400 * 0.7 * 0.3) = sqrt(84) \u2248 9.165\n\nThen ME = 1.96 / 9.165 \u2248 0.2136\n\nAlternatively, compute SE = sqrt(p\u0302(1 - p\u0302)/n) \u2248 0.02286\n\nThen ME = z * SE \u2248 0.0447\n\nWait, that's conflicting. How can both be true? It seems like I'm making a mistake here.\n\nWait, no, I think I confused the formula. The correct formula is ME = z * SE, where SE is sqrt(p\u0302(1 - p\u0302)/n).\n\nSo, ME = 1.96 * 0.02286 \u2248 0.0447\n\nBut that contradicts the other formula. I think I'm missing something.\n\nWait, no, the formula is:\n\nConfidence interval is p\u0302 \u00b1 z * SE\n\nWhere SE = sqrt(p\u0302(1 - p\u0302)/n)\n\nSo, ME is z * SE, which is 0.0447\n\nBut when I compute 1.96 / sqrt(n p\u0302(1 - p\u0302)), that's 1.96 / sqrt(84) \u2248 0.2136\n\nWait, that's different. So which one is correct?\n\nI think I need to clarify this. Let me look up the formula.\n\nUpon checking, the margin of error for a proportion is calculated as:\n\nME = z * sqrt(p\u0302(1 - p\u0302)/n)\n\nSo, it's z multiplied by the standard error, which is sqrt(p\u0302(1 - p\u0302)/n).\n\nTherefore, ME \u2248 1.96 * 0.02286 \u2248 0.0447\n\nBut wait, that's about 4.47%, not 21.4%. So where did I go wrong earlier?\n\nAh, I think I confused the formula with the one for a difference in proportions or something else. The correct formula for the margin of error for a proportion is indeed z * sqrt(p\u0302(1 - p\u0302)/n), not z divided by sqrt(n p\u0302(1 - p\u0302)).\n\nWait, but that can't be, because if n increases, the denominator increases, so the ME decreases, which makes sense.\n\nWait, let me plug in the numbers again.\n\np\u0302 = 0.7\n\nn = 400\n\nz = 1.96\n\nSE = sqrt(0.7*0.3/400) = sqrt(0.21/400) = sqrt(0.000525) \u2248 0.02286\n\nME = 1.96 * 0.02286 \u2248 0.0447\n\nSo, the margin of error is approximately 0.045, or 4.5%.\n\nBut earlier, when I used the formula ME = z / sqrt(n p\u0302 (1 - p\u0302)), I got 0.2136, which is about 21.4%. That's conflicting.\n\nI think I need to clarify which formula is correct.\n\nUpon further reflection, I realize that the formula ME = z / sqrt(n p\u0302 (1 - p\u0302)) is incorrect because that would imply that the standard error is 1/sqrt(n p\u0302 (1 - p\u0302)), which is not the case. The standard error is sqrt(p\u0302(1 - p\u0302)/n).\n\nTherefore, the correct margin of error is ME = z * sqrt(p\u0302(1 - p\u0302)/n) \u2248 0.0447.\n\nSo, my initial calculation was wrong because I misapplied the formula. The correct margin of error is approximately 0.045, not 0.214.\n\nBut wait, that seems too small. Let me check with another approach.\n\nAlternatively, the formula can be written as:\n\nME = z * sqrt(p\u0302(1 - p\u0302)/n)\n\nWhich is the same as:\n\nME = z * sqrt( (p\u0302 - p\u0304) / n )\n\nWait, no, that's the standard deviation of the sample proportion.\n\nAlternatively, the formula can be written as:\n\nME = z * sqrt( p\u0302(1 - p\u0302) / n )\n\nWhich is the same as:\n\nME = z * sqrt( (p\u0302 - p\u0304) / n )\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. The standard error is sqrt(p\u0302(1 - p\u0302)/n), which is the same as sqrt( (p\u0302 - p\u0304) / n )? No, that's not accurate.\n\nWait, no, the standard error is sqrt( p\u0302(1 - p\u0302)/n ), which is the standard deviation of the sample proportion.\n\nTherefore, ME = z * SE = 1.96 * 0.02286 \u2248 0.0447.\n\nSo, the margin of error is approximately 0.045.\n\nBut that seems small. Let me think about it. With a sample size of 400, the sample proportion is 0.7, so the standard error is sqrt(0.7*0.3/400) \u2248 0.02286.\n\nMultiplying by z=1.96 gives ME \u2248 0.0447.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, I think my initial confusion was due to mixing up the formula with another one. The correct margin of error is approximately 0.045.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought of the finite population correction, which gave a slightly higher ME, but it was negligible, around 0.0002 difference.\n\nSo, the conclusion is that the sampling method is simple random sampling, and the margin of error is approximately 0.045.\n\nBut wait, the question says to round it to three decimal places. So, 0.045 rounds to 0.045.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculation.\n\nCompute SE:\n\nSE = sqrt(0.7 * 0.3 / 400) = sqrt(0.21 / 400) = sqrt(0.000525) \u2248 0.02286\n\nME = 1.96 * 0.02286 \u2248 0.0447, which is 0.045 when rounded to three decimal places.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the final answer is simple random sampling, and the margin of error is approximately 0.045.\n\nBut wait, the question says \"which of the following sampling methods would be most appropriate\". Since the answer is simple random sampling, and the options likely include that, but since the user didn't provide options, we can just state it.\n\nSo, to sum up:\n\nSampling method: Simple random sampling.\n\nMargin of error: 0.045.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought the answer was 0.214, but that was a mistake. The correct ME is 0.045.\n\nI think I need to make sure I'm using the correct formula.\n\nYes, the formula is ME = z * sqrt(p\u0302(1 - p\u0302)/n), which is 1.96 * 0.02286 \u2248 0.0447, so 0.045.\n\nTherefore, the margin of error is 0.045.\n</think>\n\nThe most appropriate sampling method is simple random sampling. The margin of error for the 95% confidence interval is approximately 0.045.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe most appropriate sampling method is simple random sampling, and the margin of error is **0.045**.\n\nDONE."
