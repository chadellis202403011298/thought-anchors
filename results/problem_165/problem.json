  "question": "Consider the following sequence of symbol transformations:\n\nTriangle \u2192 Square \u2192 Pentagon \u2192 Hexagon \u2192 ?\n\nIf Circle \u2192 Square \u2192 Octagon \u2192 Hexagon \u2192 Triangle\nAnd Rectangle \u2192 Hexagon \u2192 Square \u2192 Circle \u2192 Pentagon\n\nWhat symbol should replace the question mark in the first sequence?",
  "answer": "To solve this problem, I need to identify the transformation pattern in each sequence and apply it to find the missing symbol.\n\n1. First, I'll analyze the given sequences to find the pattern:\n\n   Sequence 1: Triangle \u2192 Square \u2192 Pentagon \u2192 Hexagon \u2192 ?\n   Sequence 2: Circle \u2192 Square \u2192 Octagon \u2192 Hexagon \u2192 Triangle\n   Sequence 3: Rectangle \u2192 Hexagon \u2192 Square \u2192 Circle \u2192 Pentagon\n\n2. Looking at the shapes, one possible transformation could relate to the number of sides:\n   - Triangle: 3 sides\n   - Square: 4 sides\n   - Pentagon: 5 sides\n   - Hexagon: 6 sides\n   - Octagon: 8 sides\n   - Circle: Infinite sides (or 0)\n   - Rectangle: 4 sides\n\n3. Analyzing Sequence 2:\n   Circle \u2192 Square: From infinite sides to 4 sides\n   Square \u2192 Octagon: From 4 sides to 8 sides (add 4)\n   Octagon \u2192 Hexagon: From 8 sides to 6 sides (subtract 2)\n   Hexagon \u2192 Triangle: From 6 sides to 3 sides (subtract 3)\n\n4. The pattern appears to be: add 4, subtract 2, subtract 3\n\n5. Checking Sequence 3:\n   Rectangle \u2192 Hexagon: From 4 sides to 6 sides (add 2)\n   Hexagon \u2192 Square: From 6 sides to 4 sides (subtract 2)\n   Square \u2192 Circle: From 4 sides to infinite sides\n   Circle \u2192 Pentagon: From infinite sides to 5 sides\n\n6. Now I'll apply this understanding to Sequence 1:\n   Triangle \u2192 Square: From 3 sides to 4 sides (add 1)\n   Square \u2192 Pentagon: From 4 sides to 5 sides (add 1)\n   Pentagon \u2192 Hexagon: From 5 sides to 6 sides (add 1)\n   Hexagon \u2192 ?: The pattern suggests adding 1 again, so 6 + 1 = 7 sides\n\n7. A shape with 7 sides is a Heptagon.\n\nTherefore, the symbol that should replace the question mark in the first sequence is a Heptagon."
