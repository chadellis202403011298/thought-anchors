    "That means there should be a consistent arrangement of letters A, B, C, D on the cube such that when viewed from different perspectives, each cube's visible faces match the corresponding labels given in the problem.",
    "So, the front, top, right, back, left, and bottom faces each have a distinct letter.",
    "Now, the key here is that the cube can be rotated, so the visible faces from different angles should correspond to the same cube.",
    "So, if Cube 1 and Cube 2 can be rotated to show each other's visible faces, they might be the same cube.",
    "So, the front is A, top is B, right is C.",
    "So, the four visible faces are A, B, C, and the hidden faces are D and the other two.",
    "So, if the front is A, top is B, right is C, then the back, left, and bottom must be D, but that can't be because each face has a unique letter.",
    "So, each face has a unique letter, and the letters are A, B, C, D.",
    "So, each cube must have all four letters on four of its faces, and the other two faces must have...",
    "So, that means each cube has six letters, but only four unique letters, meaning some letters are repeated.",
    "Wait, the problem says: \"Each cube has exactly six letters, one on each face.\" So, each cube has six letters, one on each face.",
    "So, that would mean each cube has six letters, but only four unique letters, meaning some letters are repeated.",
    "So, each letter must appear at least once, but since there are six faces and four letters, two letters must appear twice each.",
    "So, perhaps the hidden faces can have any letters, but the visible ones are A, B, C, D.",
    "So, each cube has four visible faces labeled A, B, C, D, and two hidden faces which could have other letters or the same letters."
