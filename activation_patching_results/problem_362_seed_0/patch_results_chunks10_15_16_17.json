    "That means there should be a consistent arrangement of letters A, B, C, D on the cube such that when viewed from different perspectives, each cube's visible faces match the corresponding labels given in the problem.",
    "So, the front, top, right, back, left, and bottom faces each have a distinct letter.",
    "Now, the key here is that the cube can be rotated, so the visible faces from different angles should correspond to the same cube.",
    "So, if Cube 1 and Cube 2 can be rotated to show each other's visible faces, they might be the same cube."

  "clean_answer": " **Cube 1, Cube 2, and Cube 3 could be the same cube viewed from different angles.**\n\nBut wait, the problem asks \"Which of these cubes could be the same cube viewed from different angles?\" and the options are Cube 1, 2, 3, 4.\n\nBut from my analysis, Cube 1, 2, and 3 can be rotations of each other, but Cube 4 has a D on the front face, which is different from the others, so it can't be the same cube.\n\nBut the problem says \"Each cube has exactly six letters, one on each face.\" So, each cube must have all four letters A, B, C, D on its faces, with",
