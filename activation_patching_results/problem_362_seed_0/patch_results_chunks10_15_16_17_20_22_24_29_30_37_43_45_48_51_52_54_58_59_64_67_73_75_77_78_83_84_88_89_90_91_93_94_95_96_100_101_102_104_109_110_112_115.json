    "That means there should be a consistent arrangement of letters A, B, C, D on the cube such that when viewed from different perspectives, each cube's visible faces match the corresponding labels given in the problem.",
    "So, the front, top, right, back, left, and bottom faces each have a distinct letter.",
    "Now, the key here is that the cube can be rotated, so the visible faces from different angles should correspond to the same cube.",
    "So, if Cube 1 and Cube 2 can be rotated to show each other's visible faces, they might be the same cube.",
    "So, the front is A, top is B, right is C.",
    "So, the four visible faces are A, B, C, and the hidden faces are D and the other two.",
    "So, if the front is A, top is B, right is C, then the back, left, and bottom must be D, but that can't be because each face has a unique letter.",
    "So, each face has a unique letter, and the letters are A, B, C, D.",
    "So, each cube must have all four letters on four of its faces, and the other two faces must have...",
    "So, that means each cube has six letters, but only four unique letters, meaning some letters are repeated.",
    "Wait, the problem says: \"Each cube has exactly six letters, one on each face.\" So, each cube has six letters, one on each face.",
    "So, that would mean each cube has six letters, but only four unique letters, meaning some letters are repeated.",
    "So, each letter must appear at least once, but since there are six faces and four letters, two letters must appear twice each.",
    "So, perhaps the hidden faces can have any letters, but the visible ones are A, B, C, D.",
    "So, each cube has four visible faces labeled A, B, C, D, and two hidden faces which could have other letters or the same letters.",
    "So, the letters on the hidden faces must also be among A, B, C, D, meaning each cube has six letters, with each letter appearing at least once, and some letters appearing twice.",
    "So, the main thing is that the visible faces, when rotated, should correspond to the same cube.",
    "So, to determine if two cubes are the same, we need to see if their visible faces can be rotated to match each other.",
    "So, rotating the cube can change which face is front, top, or right.",
    "So, if I rotate the cube clockwise from the top view, the right face becomes the front face.",
    "However, the key is to see if Cube 2's configuration can be achieved by rotating Cube 1.",
    "So, to see if Cube 2 can be a rotation of Cube 1, I need to see if there's a rotation that takes A to B, B to C, and C to A on the respective faces.",
    "So, to rotate Cube 1 to get Cube 2, we need to have a rotation where the front face becomes the top face, and the top face becomes the right face, etc.",
    "But I think it's not possible because the letters are cycling in a way that would require a permutation that's not possible with cube rotations.",
    "So, the front face of Cube 2 was the top face of Cube 1, the top face of Cube 2 was the right face of Cube 1, and the right face of Cube 2 was the front face of Cube 1.",
    "But in a cube, the front, top, and right faces are all adjacent, so rotating the cube so that the top face becomes front, and the right face becomes top, etc., is possible.",
    "So, the new front face is B, which was the top face.",
    "Then, the previous front face (A) would move to the back face.",
    "The right face (C) would move to the right face, but the top face is now B.",
    "Wait, but in Cube 2, the top face is C, which was the right face of Cube 1.",
    "So, to do that, I can rotate the cube 90 degrees clockwise from the top view, making the right face come to the top.",
    "So, after rotation:\n\n- Front face becomes the previous right face, which is C.",
    "- Top face becomes the previous front face, which is A.",
    "- Right face becomes the previous top face, which is B.",
    "Cube 2's top is C, which was Cube 1's right.",
    "Cube 2's right is A, which was Cube 1's front.",
    "So, the permutation is A\u2192B, B\u2192C, C\u2192A.",
    "But in this case, the permutation A\u2192B\u2192C\u2192A is a cyclic permutation of three elements, which would require a 270-degree rotation, but since cube rotations are only in 90-degree increments, a single rotation can't achieve a cyclic permutation of three elements.",
    "If I rotate Cube 1 90 degrees clockwise from the top view, the right face (C) moves to the front, the front face (A) moves to the back, the top face (B) stays on top, and the new right face becomes the previous top face (B).",
    "Wait, but in Cube 2, the right face is A, which was the front face of Cube 1.",
    "Alternatively, if I rotate Cube 1 90 degrees to the right (from the front view), the right face (C) moves to the back, the back face (unknown) moves to the right, and the front face (A) remains front.",
    "So, the front face becomes B, the top face becomes A, and the right face becomes C."
