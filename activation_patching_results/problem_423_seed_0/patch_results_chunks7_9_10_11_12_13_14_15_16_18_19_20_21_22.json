    "So, in this case, the statement is \"If n is an integer and n\u00b2 is even, then n is even.\" The opposite of this statement would be that n is an integer, n\u00b2 is even, but n is odd.",
    "Wait, but n is an integer, so if n is odd, then n can be written as 2k + 1 for some integer k.",
    "Yeah, that's the standard form for odd integers.",
    "So, let me write that down: n = 2k + 1, where k is an integer.",
    "Now, if n is odd, then n squared would be (2k + 1) squared.",
    "Let me compute that: (2k + 1)\u00b2 = 4k\u00b2 + 4k + 1.",
    "Okay, so n\u00b2 = 4k\u00b2 + 4k + 1.",
    "But the problem states that n\u00b2 is even.",
    "So, 4k\u00b2 + 4k + 1 is even.",
    "4k\u00b2 is clearly even because it's 4 times something, which is even.",
    "Similarly, 4k is also even for the same reason.",
    "So, adding two even numbers, 4k\u00b2 and 4k, gives another even number.",
    "Then we add 1, which is odd.",
    "So, even + odd = odd."
