    "So, in this case, the statement is \"If n is an integer and n\u00b2 is even, then n is even.\" The opposite of this statement would be that n is an integer, n\u00b2 is even, but n is odd.",
    "Wait, but n is an integer, so if n is odd, then n can be written as 2k + 1 for some integer k.",
    "Yeah, that's the standard form for odd integers.",
    "So, let me write that down: n = 2k + 1, where k is an integer.",
    "Now, if n is odd, then n squared would be (2k + 1) squared.",
    "Let me compute that: (2k + 1)\u00b2 = 4k\u00b2 + 4k + 1.",
    "Okay, so n\u00b2 = 4k\u00b2 + 4k + 1.",
    "But the problem states that n\u00b2 is even.",
    "So, 4k\u00b2 + 4k + 1 is even.",
    "4k\u00b2 is clearly even because it's 4 times something, which is even.",
    "Similarly, 4k is also even for the same reason.",
    "So, adding two even numbers, 4k\u00b2 and 4k, gives another even number.",
    "Then we add 1, which is odd.",
    "So, even + odd = odd.",
    "Therefore, n\u00b2 would be odd.",
    "So, we have a contradiction because we started by assuming that n is odd, which led us to n\u00b2 being odd, but n\u00b2 is supposed to be even.",
    "That's a contradiction because something can't be both even and odd at the same time.",
    "Therefore, our initial assumption that n is odd must be false.",
    "So, n must be even.",
    "So, by assuming the opposite and reaching a contradiction, we've proven that if n\u00b2 is even, then n must be even.",
    "Assume n is odd, express it as 2k + 1, square it, and show that the square is odd, which contradicts the given that n\u00b2 is even.",
    "Hence, n can't be odd, so it must be even.",
    "</think>\n\nAlright, let's break this down step by step using proof by contradiction.",
    "To use proof by contradiction, we'll assume the opposite: that \\( n \\) is odd."
