    "If a claim can be tested and found to be incorrect, then it's falsifiable.",
    "Option A: Maria says, \"Plants grow toward light because they have an inherent spiritual connection to the sun's energy.\" Hmm, this sounds more like a philosophical or religious statement rather than a scientific one.",
    "It's suggesting a non-material, spiritual reason.",
    "I don't think this is a falsifiable claim because it's more about belief than something that can be tested scientifically.",
    "But Maria's statement is more abstract and not tied to observable mechanisms.",
    "Option B: Alex states, \"Plants grow toward light because they contain a hormone called auxin that accumulates on the shaded side, causing cells there to elongate more than on the light-exposed side.\" This seems like a scientific explanation.",
    "If we could show that auxin doesn't cause this elongation, then Alex's claim would be falsified.",
    "So, this is definitely falsifiable.",
    "Option C: Jamal claims, \"Plants grow toward light because it is their purpose in nature to seek illumination.\" Similar to Maria's statement, this sounds more like a teleological argument, suggesting that plants have a purpose or intention.",
    "It's more of a philosophical or religious viewpoint rather than a scientific explanation.",
    "Like Maria's statement, it's not based on observable mechanisms and is more about why something exists rather than how it works.",
    "So, this isn't falsifiable in a scientific sense.",
    "On one hand, it's a general statement about plant behavior over time.",
    "However, it's not making a specific claim about the mechanism, like the auxin theory.",
    "It's more of a descriptive statement about historical behavior.",
    "However, it's a bit vague because it's making a claim about all plants throughout history, which might not be entirely testable in the same way as Alex's specific claim.",
    "Still, it's somewhat falsifiable because it's making a universal statement that can be tested with counterexamples.",
    "Alex's claim is specific about the hormone auxin, which is a well-established scientific concept, making it easily falsifiable.",
    "Lisa's claim is a bit more ambiguous, but it's still making a general statement that can potentially be tested, so it's also falsifiable.",
    "However, the question asks for the statement that \"describes a scientifically falsifiable claim.\" Since Alex's statement directly refers to a specific biological mechanism (auxin), it's the most clearly falsifiable."
