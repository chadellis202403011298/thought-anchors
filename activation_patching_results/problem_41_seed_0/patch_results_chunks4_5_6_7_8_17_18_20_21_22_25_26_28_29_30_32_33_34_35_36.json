    "She formulates a hypothesis that 'increased sunlight leads to taller tomato plants.' To test this, she selects 20 tomato seedlings of the same variety and age.",
    "She places 10 plants in the sunny corner and 10 in a partially shaded area of the garden.",
    "All plants receive identical soil, water, and fertilizer.",
    "After 6 weeks, she measures the height of all plants.",
    "The results show that plants in the sunny corner have an average height of 24 inches, while plants in the partially shaded area have an average height of 19 inches.",
    "She thinks that more sunlight makes the plants taller.",
    "So her hypothesis is that increased sunlight leads to taller tomato plants.",
    "That makes sense because if those other factors were different, it might skew the results and not be just about the sunlight.",
    "Now, looking at the results, the plants with more sunlight are significantly taller.",
    "So, at first glance, this supports her hypothesis.",
    "So those variables are controlled for.",
    "That's good because it reduces the chance of other factors affecting the results.",
    "So they should be genetically identical and at the same stage of growth.",
    "That means any differences in growth should be due to environmental factors, not genetic differences or different growth stages.",
    "The gardener measured the height after six weeks.",
    "So, the time frame seems appropriate to see the effect of sunlight on growth.",
    "Now, thinking about the experimental design: she used a randomized sample\u201420 plants split evenly into two groups.",
    "That's a good approach because it minimizes the chance of selection bias.",
    "If she had, say, chosen plants that were already taller for the sunny corner, it might have skewed the results.",
    "But by randomly assigning them, it's more likely that the differences are due to the treatment (sunlight) rather than other factors."
