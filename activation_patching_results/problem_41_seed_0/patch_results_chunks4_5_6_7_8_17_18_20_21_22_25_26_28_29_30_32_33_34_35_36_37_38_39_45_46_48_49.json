    "She formulates a hypothesis that 'increased sunlight leads to taller tomato plants.' To test this, she selects 20 tomato seedlings of the same variety and age.",
    "She places 10 plants in the sunny corner and 10 in a partially shaded area of the garden.",
    "All plants receive identical soil, water, and fertilizer.",
    "After 6 weeks, she measures the height of all plants.",
    "The results show that plants in the sunny corner have an average height of 24 inches, while plants in the partially shaded area have an average height of 19 inches.",
    "She thinks that more sunlight makes the plants taller.",
    "So her hypothesis is that increased sunlight leads to taller tomato plants.",
    "That makes sense because if those other factors were different, it might skew the results and not be just about the sunlight.",
    "Now, looking at the results, the plants with more sunlight are significantly taller.",
    "So, at first glance, this supports her hypothesis.",
    "So those variables are controlled for.",
    "That's good because it reduces the chance of other factors affecting the results.",
    "So they should be genetically identical and at the same stage of growth.",
    "That means any differences in growth should be due to environmental factors, not genetic differences or different growth stages.",
    "The gardener measured the height after six weeks.",
    "So, the time frame seems appropriate to see the effect of sunlight on growth.",
    "Now, thinking about the experimental design: she used a randomized sample\u201420 plants split evenly into two groups.",
    "That's a good approach because it minimizes the chance of selection bias.",
    "If she had, say, chosen plants that were already taller for the sunny corner, it might have skewed the results.",
    "But by randomly assigning them, it's more likely that the differences are due to the treatment (sunlight) rather than other factors.",
    "She also used a control group\u2014the partially shaded area.",
    "This is important because it provides a baseline to compare against.",
    "If the shaded plants had grown just as tall, it might not support the hypothesis, but in this case, they were shorter, which aligns with the idea that more sunlight leads to taller plants.",
    "Also, the gardener didn't measure other factors like leaf health or fruit production, but since she's only looking at height, that's the main variable of interest.",
    "So, that's fine.",
    "She controlled for variables like soil, water, and fertilizer, used a randomized sample, and measured the plants after a sufficient period.",
    "The results show a clear difference in height between the two groups, which supports her hypothesis that increased sunlight leads to taller tomato plants."
