  "clean_answer": " The gardener can conclude that increased sunlight leads to taller tomato plants. Her experimental design, which included randomization, identical conditions for all plants except sunlight, and a control group, strengthens her conclusion. However, the small sample size might limit the generalizability of the results.\n\nDONE.",
  "corrupted_answer": "://\n\nThe gardener can conclude that the increased sunlight exposure likely caused the taller growth of the tomato plants in the sunny corner. Aspects that strengthen her conclusion include controlling for other variables, randomizing the plant selection, and measuring after a sufficient time period. A potential weakness is the reliance on a single variable (sunlight) without considering other factors like temperature.\n\nDONE.",

Her controlled setup, with identical conditions for all plants except sunlight, and random selection, provides strong evidence for this conclusion. The significant height difference between the groups suggests that sunlight exposure is a key factor in tomato plant growth. \n\nDONE.",
