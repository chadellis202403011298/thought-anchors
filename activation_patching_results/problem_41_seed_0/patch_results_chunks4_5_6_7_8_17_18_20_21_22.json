    "She formulates a hypothesis that 'increased sunlight leads to taller tomato plants.' To test this, she selects 20 tomato seedlings of the same variety and age.",
    "She places 10 plants in the sunny corner and 10 in a partially shaded area of the garden.",
    "All plants receive identical soil, water, and fertilizer.",
    "After 6 weeks, she measures the height of all plants.",
    "The results show that plants in the sunny corner have an average height of 24 inches, while plants in the partially shaded area have an average height of 19 inches.",
    "She thinks that more sunlight makes the plants taller.",
    "So her hypothesis is that increased sunlight leads to taller tomato plants.",
    "That makes sense because if those other factors were different, it might skew the results and not be just about the sunlight.",
    "Now, looking at the results, the plants with more sunlight are significantly taller.",
    "So, at first glance, this supports her hypothesis."
