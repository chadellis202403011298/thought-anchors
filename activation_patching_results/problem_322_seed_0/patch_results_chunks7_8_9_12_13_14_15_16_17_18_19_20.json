    "There are 100 boats, each can catch up to 10 tons of fish per season.",
    "If the total catch exceeds 600 tons in a season, the fish population declines by 20% the next season.",
    "Each boat owner is acting independently to maximize their own catch, and they all know about the research findings regarding sustainability.",
    "Each boat can catch up to 10 tons.",
    "So, if all 100 boats catch the maximum, that's 100 * 10 = 1000 tons.",
    "But if they exceed 600 tons in total, the fish population drops by 20% the next season.",
    "So, the threshold is 600 tons.",
    "If they exceed that, the next season's fish population is reduced.",
    "Now, each boat owner wants to maximize their own catch.",
    "So, they have to decide how much to catch each season to maximize their own profit or whatever metric they're using, but the problem says they want to maximize their own catch.",
    "So, each boat's goal is to catch as much as possible without causing the total catch to exceed 600 tons, because if it does, the next season's fish population drops, which would affect everyone, including themselves.",
    "But wait, if they all try to maximize their own catch, they might overfish, leading to a total catch exceeding 600 tons, which would cause the fish population to decline."

  "clean_answer": " The fish population will remain stable over the three seasons if each boat catches exactly 6 tons each season, as this keeps the total catch below the threshold that would cause a population decline. However, if boats exceed the 600-ton threshold, the population will drop by 20% each subsequent season, leading to a decline in fish stocks over time. Given the rational and informed nature of the boat owners, they will likely choose to catch 6 tons each season to maintain sustainability and avoid population decline.\n\nDONE.",

However, if boats try to maximize their own catches individually, the total catch could exceed 600 tons, leading to a 20% decline in the fish population each subsequent season.
