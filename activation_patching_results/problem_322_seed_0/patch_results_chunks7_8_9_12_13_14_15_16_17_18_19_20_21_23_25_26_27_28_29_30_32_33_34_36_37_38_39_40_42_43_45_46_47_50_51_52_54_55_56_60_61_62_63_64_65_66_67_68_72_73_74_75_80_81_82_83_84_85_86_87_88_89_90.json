    "Each boat can catch up to 10 tons.",
    "So, if all 100 boats catch the maximum, that's 100 * 10 = 1000 tons.",

    "So, the threshold is 600 tons.",
    "If they exceed that, the next season's fish population is reduced.",
    "Now, each boat owner wants to maximize their own catch.",
    "So, they have to decide how much to catch each season to maximize their own profit or whatever metric they're using, but the problem says they want to maximize their own catch.",
    "So, each boat's goal is to catch as much as possible without causing the total catch to exceed 600 tons, because if it does, the next season's fish population drops, which would affect everyone, including themselves.",
    "But wait, if they all try to maximize their own catch, they might overfish, leading to a total catch exceeding 600 tons, which would cause the fish population to decline.",
    "So, there's a conflict here between individual maximization and the collective sustainability.",
    "So, they have to balance between catching as much as possible without causing the total to exceed 600.",
    "If all 100 boats catch 10 tons, that's 1000 tons, which is way over 600.",

    "However, if they all catch exactly 6 tons, that's 600 tons total, which is the threshold.",

    "But each boat wants to maximize their own catch.",
    "So, if they all catch exactly 6 tons, they're all at the limit.",

    "But that would require each boat to catch exactly 6 tons, which might not be optimal for them individually.",
    "Wait, but if they all catch exactly 6, each boat is getting 6 tons.",
    "But if they can catch more, they might do so, even if it causes the population to drop, because they might think that in the next season, the population is lower, so their catch would be lower, but they can catch more in the first season.",
