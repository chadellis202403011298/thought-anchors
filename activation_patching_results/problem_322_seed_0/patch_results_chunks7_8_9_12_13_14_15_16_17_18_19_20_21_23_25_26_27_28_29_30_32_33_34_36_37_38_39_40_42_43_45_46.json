    "There are 100 boats, each can catch up to 10 tons of fish per season.",
    "If the total catch exceeds 600 tons in a season, the fish population declines by 20% the next season.",
    "Each boat owner is acting independently to maximize their own catch, and they all know about the research findings regarding sustainability.",
    "Each boat can catch up to 10 tons.",
    "So, if all 100 boats catch the maximum, that's 100 * 10 = 1000 tons.",
    "But if they exceed 600 tons in total, the fish population drops by 20% the next season.",
    "So, the threshold is 600 tons.",
    "If they exceed that, the next season's fish population is reduced.",
    "Now, each boat owner wants to maximize their own catch.",
    "So, they have to decide how much to catch each season to maximize their own profit or whatever metric they're using, but the problem says they want to maximize their own catch.",
    "So, each boat's goal is to catch as much as possible without causing the total catch to exceed 600 tons, because if it does, the next season's fish population drops, which would affect everyone, including themselves.",
    "But wait, if they all try to maximize their own catch, they might overfish, leading to a total catch exceeding 600 tons, which would cause the fish population to decline.",
    "So, there's a conflict here between individual maximization and the collective sustainability.",
    "So, they have to balance between catching as much as possible without causing the total to exceed 600.",
    "If all 100 boats catch 10 tons, that's 1000 tons, which is way over 600.",
    "So, they can't all catch 10 tons because that would exceed the threshold.",
    "So, they have to reduce their catch to ensure the total doesn't exceed 600.",
    "But each boat wants to maximize their own catch.",
    "So, they might try to catch as much as possible without causing the total to exceed 600.",
    "So, the total allowed is 600 tons.",
    "So, each boat could, in theory, catch 6 tons, because 100 * 6 = 600.",
    "But if they all catch exactly 6 tons, that's the maximum they can do without exceeding the threshold.",
    "However, if they all catch exactly 6 tons, that's 600 tons total, which is the threshold.",
    "So, exactly 600 is the threshold, not exceeding.",
    "So, if they all catch exactly 6 tons, the population doesn't drop.",
    "But if they catch more, the population drops.",
    "But each boat wants to maximize their own catch.",
    "So, if they all catch exactly 6 tons, they're all at the limit.",
    "But since they all act independently, they might not coordinate.",
    "So, perhaps they all try to catch as much as possible, leading to a total that might exceed 600.",
    "So, each boat would have an incentive to catch more than 6, but if they all do, the total would exceed 600, causing the population to drop.",
    "But since they are rational and understand this, they might realize that if they all catch more than 6, the population drops, which would reduce their catches in the next season."

  "clean_answer": " The fish population will remain stable over the three seasons if each boat catches exactly 6 tons each season, as this keeps the total catch below the threshold that would cause a population decline. However, if boats exceed the 600-ton threshold, the population will drop by 20% each subsequent season, leading to a decline in fish stocks over time. Given the rational and informed nature of the boat owners, they will likely choose to catch 6 tons each season to maintain sustainability and avoid population decline.\n\nDONE.",

If they all catch 6 tons, the total remains at 600, preventing population decline. However, if any boat catches more, the population will drop, leading to lower catches in subsequent seasons.
