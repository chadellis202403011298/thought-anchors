    "Since the traveler doesn't know which village the resident is from, the question has to be designed in a way that both types of people will give a consistent answer that points to the truth-tellers' village.",
    "Maybe something like asking about what the other person would say? Because if you ask a truth-teller, they'll give a truthful answer, and if you ask a liar, they'll lie about what the truth-teller would say, which might end up pointing to the truth.",
    "So, perhaps the question should be something along the lines of, \"If I asked you which path leads to the truth-tellers' village, would you tell me the truth?\" Wait, but if the resident is a truth-teller, they would honestly tell the traveler that they would say the truth.",
    "But if the resident is a liar, they would lie about their response, so they might say \"yes\" even though they would lie.",
    "Conversely, a liar would lie about what the truth-teller would say, which would also end up pointing to the truth-tellers' village.",
    "Therefore, the traveler would know that the opposite is the correct path.",
    "On the other hand, if the traveler is talking to a liar, the liar would lie about what the truth-teller would say.",
    "The truth-teller would say the correct path, so the liar would lie and say the incorrect path.",
    "Thus, the liar's answer would also point to the wrong path, and the traveler would again deduce that the opposite is correct.",
    "That doesn't help because both would say \"yes,\" which doesn't distinguish between the two.",
    "So, \"If I asked a resident from the other village which path leads to the truth-tellers' village, what would they say?\" If the traveler is talking to a truth-teller, they'll truthfully report what a liar would say, which is the wrong path.",
    "If they're talking to a liar, they'll lie about what a truth-teller would say, which is the correct path.",
    "So in both cases, the answer points to the wrong path, meaning the traveler should take the opposite.",
    "So if the resident is a truth-teller, they'll truthfully say what a liar would say, which is the wrong path.",
    "So the traveler would know that the resident is a truth-teller and that the resident said the wrong path, so the correct path is the opposite.",
    "Similarly, if the resident is a liar, they'll lie about what a truth-teller would say, which is the correct path.",
    "So the liar would say the wrong path, and the traveler would realize that the correct path is the opposite.",
    "Therefore, the key is to ask a question that forces both types to indicate the wrong path, allowing the traveler to choose the opposite as the correct one.",
    "So the question should be, \"If I asked you which path leads to the truth-tellers' village, what would the other village's resident say?\" Or more concisely, \"What would the other village's resident say about the correct path?\" Either way, the answer points to the wrong path, so the traveler takes the other one."
