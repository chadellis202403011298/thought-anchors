    "Since the traveler doesn't know which village the resident is from, the question has to be designed in a way that both types of people will give a consistent answer that points to the truth-tellers' village.",
    "Maybe something like asking about what the other person would say? Because if you ask a truth-teller, they'll give a truthful answer, and if you ask a liar, they'll lie about what the truth-teller would say, which might end up pointing to the truth.",
    "So, perhaps the question should be something along the lines of, \"If I asked you which path leads to the truth-tellers' village, would you tell me the truth?\" Wait, but if the resident is a truth-teller, they would honestly tell the traveler that they would say the truth.",
    "But if the resident is a liar, they would lie about their response, so they might say \"yes\" even though they would lie.",
    "Conversely, a liar would lie about what the truth-teller would say, which would also end up pointing to the truth-tellers' village.",
    "Therefore, the traveler would know that the opposite is the correct path.",
    "On the other hand, if the traveler is talking to a liar, the liar would lie about what the truth-teller would say.",
    "The truth-teller would say the correct path, so the liar would lie and say the incorrect path.",
    "Thus, the liar's answer would also point to the wrong path, and the traveler would again deduce that the opposite is correct."
