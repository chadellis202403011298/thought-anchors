    "Because the overall completion time will be determined by the robot that takes the longest time.",

    "Similarly, Robot B, the middle speed, is assigned to Location 2, which is 3 miles, and Robot A, the slowest, is assigned to Location 1, 2 miles.",
    "So, each robot is handling a distance that is appropriate for their speed, which allows them to all finish in 2 hours.",
    "But in Assignment 1, Robot A is assigned the shortest distance, which is good.",
    "Robot B is assigned the middle, and Robot C the longest.",
    "So, their times are all 2 hours.",
    "That's worse than 2 hours.",
    "So, better to have Robot A go to Location 1.",
    "Similarly, if Robot B goes to Location 3, 4 miles / 3 mph \u2248 1.333 hours each way, so 2.6667 hours total."
