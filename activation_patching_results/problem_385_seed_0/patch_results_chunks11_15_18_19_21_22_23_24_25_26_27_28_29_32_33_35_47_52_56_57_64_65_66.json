    "So, all three robots are working simultaneously, which is good because it should help in finishing faster.",
    "On the other hand, if we can balance the distances, the total time should be minimized.",
    "Since they need to return to the depot, the round trip time would be twice that distance/speed.",
    "So, for each location, the time it would take a robot to go there and come back is 2*(distance)/speed.",
    "**Location 1 (2 miles):**\n   - **Agent A**: 2 miles / 2 mph = 1 hour one way, so round trip is 2 hours.",
    "- **Agent B**: 2 miles / 3 mph \u2248 0.6667 hours one way, round trip \u2248 1.3333 hours.",
    "- **Agent C**: 2 miles / 4 mph = 0.5 hours one way, round trip 1 hour.",
    "2. **Location 2 (3 miles):**\n   - **Agent A**: 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours one way, round trip 3 hours.",
    "- **Agent B**: 3 / 3 = 1 hour one way, round trip 2 hours.",
    "- **Agent C**: 3 / 4 = 0.75 hours one way, round trip 1.5 hours.",
    "3. **Location 3 (4 miles):**\n   - **Agent A**: 4 / 2 = 2 hours one way, round trip 4 hours.",
    "- **Agent B**: 4 / 3 \u2248 1.3333 hours one way, round trip \u2248 2.6667 hours.",
    "- **Agent C**: 4 / 4 = 1 hour one way, round trip 2 hours.",
    "Because the overall completion time will be determined by the robot that takes the longest time.",
    "So, if we can balance the times, the overall time will be as small as possible.",
    "But since there are 3 robots and 3 locations, there are 3! = 6 possible permutations.",
    "3 hours\n6.",
    "So, yeah, all robots have 2 hours.",
    "Robot B is going to Location 2, 3 miles, 1 hour each way, 2 hours total.",
    "Robot A is going to Location 1, 2 miles, 1 hour each way, 2 hours total.",
    "That makes sense because Robot C can handle that distance quickly.",
    "Similarly, Robot B, the middle speed, is assigned to Location 2, which is 3 miles, and Robot A, the slowest, is assigned to Location 1, 2 miles.",
    "So, each robot is handling a distance that is appropriate for their speed, which allows them to all finish in 2 hours."
