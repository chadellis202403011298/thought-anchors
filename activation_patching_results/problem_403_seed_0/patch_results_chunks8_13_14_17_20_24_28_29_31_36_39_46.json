    "Now, the cube is going to be rotated 90 degrees clockwise around the vertical axis.",
    "So, in the initial position, red is on the left, blue on the right, and yellow on top.",
    "That leaves green, orange, and purple for the front, back, and bottom.",
    "So, the bottom face isn't visible in this view.",
    "So, when I rotate the cube 90 degrees clockwise, the top face will move to the right, the right face will move to the back, and the back face will move to the left, while the left face moves to the front.",
    "So, each face's position shifts in that direction.",
    "Since the problem is about the visible faces after rotation, which are left, right, and top again, I just need to track how the existing visible faces move and where the new colors come from.",
    "In the initial position, the visible faces are:\n- Left: Red\n- Right: Blue\n- Top: Yellow\n\nAfter a 90-degree clockwise rotation around the vertical axis, the top face (Yellow) will move to the right, the right face (Blue) will move to the back, the back face will move to the left, and the left face (Red) will move to the front.",
    "So, after rotation, the front face becomes the previous left face (Red), the right face becomes the previous top face (Yellow), and the back face becomes the previous right face (Blue).",
    "So, the camera, which was initially seeing left, right, and top, will now see the new positions after rotation.",
    "When you rotate the cube 90 degrees clockwise, the top face (Yellow) moves to the right, so the right face (Blue) moves towards the back, and the back face (which was previously hidden) comes into view on the left, and the left face (Red) moves to the front.",
    "So maybe I don't need to know the exact colors for front, back, and bottom, but just their positions relative to the rotation."
