    "Now, the cube is going to be rotated 90 degrees clockwise around the vertical axis.",
    "So, in the initial position, red is on the left, blue on the right, and yellow on top.",
    "That leaves green, orange, and purple for the front, back, and bottom.",
    "So, the bottom face isn't visible in this view.",
    "So, when I rotate the cube 90 degrees clockwise, the top face will move to the right, the right face will move to the back, and the back face will move to the left, while the left face moves to the front.",
    "So, each face's position shifts in that direction.",
    "Since the problem is about the visible faces after rotation, which are left, right, and top again, I just need to track how the existing visible faces move and where the new colors come from.",
    "In the initial position, the visible faces are:\n- Left: Red\n- Right: Blue\n- Top: Yellow\n\nAfter a 90-degree clockwise rotation around the vertical axis, the top face (Yellow) will move to the right, the right face (Blue) will move to the back, the back face will move to the left, and the left face (Red) will move to the front.",
    "So, after rotation, the front face becomes the previous left face (Red), the right face becomes the previous top face (Yellow), and the back face becomes the previous right face (Blue).",
    "So, the camera, which was initially seeing left, right, and top, will now see the new positions after rotation.",
    "When you rotate the cube 90 degrees clockwise, the top face (Yellow) moves to the right, so the right face (Blue) moves towards the back, and the back face (which was previously hidden) comes into view on the left, and the left face (Red) moves to the front.",
    "So maybe I don't need to know the exact colors for front, back, and bottom, but just their positions relative to the rotation.",
    "When the cube is rotated 90 degrees clockwise around the vertical axis (z-axis), the rotation will affect the x and y axes.",
    "So the rotation matrix becomes:\n\n[0  1  0]\n[-1 0  0]\n[0  0  1]\n\nThis means that any point (x, y, z) will be transformed to (y, -x, z).",
    "After rotation, it moves to (0, -negative x, 0) which is (0, positive x, 0), so it's now on the positive x-axis, which is the right side.",
    "- The right face (Blue) was at (positive x, 0, 0).",
    "After rotation, it moves to (0, -positive x, 0) which is (0, negative x, 0), so it's now on the negative x-axis, which would be the left side.",
    "After rotation, it remains at (0, 0, positive z), but its position relative to the cube changes.",
    "The rotation affects the cube's orientation, so the faces that were previously visible will move.",
    "But the problem is that the cube's orientation relative to the camera is changing, so the visible faces from the camera's viewpoint will change as well.",
    "Initially, from the camera's view:\n- Left: Red\n- Right: Blue\n- Top: Yellow\n\nAfter a 90-degree clockwise rotation, the cube's top face (Yellow) moves to the right, so the right face (Blue) moves to the back, the back face (unknown color) moves to the left, and the left face (Red) moves to the front.",
    "But the front face was previously hidden, so now it becomes visible on the left side.",
    "So, the front face (Green) will move to the right, the right face (Blue) will move to the back, the back face (Orange) will move to the left, and the left face (Red) will move to the front.",
    "The top face (Yellow) will move to the right, the right face (Blue) will move to the back, the back face (Orange) will move to the left, and the left face (Red) will move to the front.",
    "So, after rotation, the visible faces from the camera's viewpoint would be:\n\n- Left: Front face (which was Red, now moved to front)\n- Right: Back face (which was Blue, now moved to back)\n- Top: The previous top face (Yellow) has moved to the right, but now the right face is the back face (Blue), so the new top face is the previous back face, which was Orange.",
    "When you rotate the cube 90 degrees clockwise, the top face (Yellow) moves to the right, so the right face (Blue) becomes the back face, and the back face (Orange) becomes the left face, while the left face (Red) becomes the front face.",
    "But from the camera's perspective, which is fixed, the visible faces change as the cube rotates.",
    "After a 90-degree clockwise rotation, the cube's orientation changes, so the left face becomes what was previously the front face, the right face becomes what was previously the back face, and the top face remains on top but has moved.",
    "When you rotate the cube 90 degrees clockwise around the vertical axis, the top face (Yellow) moves to the right, the right face (Blue) moves to the back, the back face (Orange) moves to the left, and the left face (Red) moves to the front.",
    "So, from the camera's perspective, which was initially seeing left (Red), right (Blue), and top (Yellow), after rotation, the cube's front face (Green) is now on the left, the left face (Red) is now on the front, the back face (Orange) is now on the right, and the right face (Blue) is now on the back.",
