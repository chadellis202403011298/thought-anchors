    "Now, the cube is going to be rotated 90 degrees clockwise around the vertical axis.",
    "So, in the initial position, red is on the left, blue on the right, and yellow on top.",
    "That leaves green, orange, and purple for the front, back, and bottom.",
    "So, the bottom face isn't visible in this view.",
    "So, when I rotate the cube 90 degrees clockwise, the top face will move to the right, the right face will move to the back, and the back face will move to the left, while the left face moves to the front.",
    "So, each face's position shifts in that direction.",
    "Since the problem is about the visible faces after rotation, which are left, right, and top again, I just need to track how the existing visible faces move and where the new colors come from."
