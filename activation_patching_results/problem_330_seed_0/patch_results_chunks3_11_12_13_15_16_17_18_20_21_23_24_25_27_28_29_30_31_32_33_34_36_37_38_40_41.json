    "Out of 200 patients, 120 preferred morning appointments and 80 preferred afternoon appointments.",
    "There are 200 patients in total.",
    "Out of these, 120 prefer morning appointments (M) and 80 prefer afternoon appointments (A).",
    "So, 120 M and 80 A.",
    "That adds up to 200, so that's consistent.",
    "Now, among the female patients, 70 preferred morning appointments.",
    "Hmm, so out of 100 F, 70 chose M, which leaves 30 F who preferred A.",
    "That makes sense because 70 + 30 = 100.",
    "If they are independent, the distribution of preferences should be the same across genders.",
    "But if they're dependent, one gender might prefer one time more than the other.",
    "Since we know that among F, 70 chose M, that means the remaining M preferences must come from males.",
    "So, total M preferences are 120, and F contributed 70, so 120 - 70 = 50 M must be from males.",
    "That would mean 50 males preferred M, and the remaining males, which is 100 - 50 = 50, preferred A.",
    "For independence, the joint distribution should factor into the product of individual probabilities.",
    "So, the probability of being female and preferring M should equal the probability of being female times the probability of preferring M.",
    "Probability of being female and preferring M: 70/200 = 0.35\nProbability of being female: 100/200 = 0.5\nProbability of preferring M: 120/200 = 0.6\nSo, 0.5 * 0.6 = 0.3, but we have 0.35, which is higher.",
    "That suggests that being female increases the probability of preferring M.",
    "Alternatively, looking at the males: probability of being male and preferring M is 50/200 = 0.25\nProbability of being male: 0.5\nProbability of preferring M: 0.6\n0.5 * 0.6 = 0.3, but we have 0.25, which is lower.",
    "So, being male decreases the probability of preferring M.",
    "This indicates that there's a dependence between gender and appointment preference.",
    "Specifically, females are more likely to prefer morning appointments, and males are less likely compared to the overall distribution.",
    "For independence, the expected counts would be:\n\n- Expected M for F: (100 * 120)/200 = 60\n- But we have 70, which is higher.",
    "Similarly, expected A for M: (100 * 80)/200 = 40\nBut we have 50, which is higher.",
    "This discrepancy suggests that gender and preference are not independent.",
    "Females are more likely to prefer mornings, and males are less likely compared to overall rates.",
