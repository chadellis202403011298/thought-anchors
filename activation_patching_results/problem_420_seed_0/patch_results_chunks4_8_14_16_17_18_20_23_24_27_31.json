One potential confounding variable is socioeconomic status, as individuals with higher socioeconomic status may have better access to healthcare and healthier lifestyles. Additionally, the program's availability might be limited to certain groups, possibly those who were already healthier before its implementation. The department should also assess if there were broader community improvements, such as safer parks or better healthcare facilities, which could have contributed to the observed decrease in heart disease rates. Without controlling for these variables, it's challenging to definitively attribute the reduction solely to the program. \n\nDONE.",
