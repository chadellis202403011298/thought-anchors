  "question": "A janitor is asked to paint numbers on 100 doors in a long hallway, numbered consecutively from 1 to 100. The janitor has only black and gold paint available. The supervisor gives the following instructions: 'Paint all prime numbers in gold, and all other numbers in black.' When the janitor begins working, he realizes he doesn't know what a prime number is, but he doesn't want to ask and appear ignorant. However, he does remember a different property of numbers from school. If he uses this alternate property to decide which doors to paint gold, he will paint exactly all the doors that should be gold, plus some additional doors. What property could the janitor use to make sure all prime-numbered doors get painted gold, even if some non-prime doors also get painted gold?",
  "answer": "The janitor could use the property: 'Paint all doors with numbers that are not divisible by any other number except 1 and themselves, as well as all doors with odd numbers, in gold.'\n\nStep 1: Identify the constraints in the problem. The janitor needs to paint all prime doors gold, but doesn't know what prime numbers are.\n\nStep 2: Recall that prime numbers are numbers divisible only by 1 and themselves (like 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, etc.).\n\nStep 3: Relax the constraint by finding a broader property that would include all primes. All prime numbers except 2 are odd numbers.\n\nStep 4: By painting all odd-numbered doors gold, the janitor would correctly paint all prime doors gold (except door #2).\n\nStep 5: To ensure door #2 also gets painted gold, the janitor could add the actual definition of prime numbers to his rule.\n\nStep 6: This relaxed constraint will result in painting all the prime doors gold (which is required), but also some non-prime odd doors like 9, 15, 21, etc. (which is acceptable according to the problem).\n\nThe property works because:\n- All primes greater than 2 are odd numbers\n- Door #2 would be painted gold because it's only divisible by 1 and itself\n- This ensures all prime-numbered doors get painted gold, even though some non-prime doors also get painted gold (all the odd composite numbers)."
