  "question": "A woman is sitting in her hotel room when there is a knock on the door. She opens the door to see a man whom she has never met before. She says, 'Oh it's you. I was expecting you.' How did she know who the man was without having met him before?",
  "answer": "The key to solving this lateral thinking problem is to identify and relax assumed constraints:\n\n1. Many people automatically assume that recognizing someone requires prior personal interaction with them.\n\n2. By relaxing this constraint, we can consider other ways of recognizing someone without having met them personally.\n\n3. The answer is that the man was the hotel room service staff (or perhaps a bellhop, maintenance worker, etc.) whom she had called earlier.\n\n4. She recognized him by his uniform or the items he was carrying (like food tray, tools, etc.), not because she had met him personally before.\n\n5. This solution requires relaxing the constraint that 'recognizing someone' must mean 'having met them personally before' and considering alternative ways of identifying someone, such as by their role or function rather than their individual identity.\n\nThis demonstrates constraint relaxation by challenging our automatic assumption about what 'recognition' entails."
