  "question": "A small town has a library with 5,000 books initially. Each month, community members donate an average of 100 new books to the library, while an average of 80 books become too damaged to keep and are removed from circulation. The library director wants to predict the library's inventory over time. If this pattern continues consistently, approximately how many books will be in the library after 2 years? Additionally, explain what kind of system behavior this represents and when (if ever) the library's book collection would stabilize.",
  "answer": "This problem involves a simple system with inflows and outflows affecting a stock (the book inventory).\n\nStep 1: Identify the system structure.\n- Stock: Library book inventory (initially 5,000 books)\n- Inflow: Donations (100 books/month)\n- Outflow: Damaged books removed (80 books/month)\n- Net change: +20 books/month\n\nStep 2: Calculate the future state after 2 years.\n- Time period: 2 years = 24 months\n- Total change over 24 months: 24 months \u00d7 20 books/month = 480 books\n- Final inventory: 5,000 + 480 = 5,480 books\n\nStep 3: Identify the system behavior.\nThis is an example of linear growth. The stock (book inventory) increases at a constant rate because the inflow consistently exceeds the outflow by a fixed amount. The net rate of change remains constant at +20 books per month.\n\nStep 4: Determine if and when the system will stabilize.\nFor a system to stabilize (reach equilibrium), the inflows must equal the outflows. In this case, the donation rate (100 books/month) exceeds the removal rate (80 books/month), so the system will not reach an equilibrium state on its own. The book collection will continue to grow indefinitely at a rate of 20 books per month unless one of the following occurs:\n- The donation rate decreases\n- The removal rate increases\n- The library implements a policy to limit the collection size\n\nTherefore, the library's book collection will have 5,480 books after 2 years and represents a system with linear growth that does not stabilize."
