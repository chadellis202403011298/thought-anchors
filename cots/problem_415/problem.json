  "question": "In the land of Logicia, there are three tribes: the Truth-tellers (who always tell the truth), the Liars (who always lie), and the Alternators (who alternate between telling the truth and lying, starting with the truth on their first statement). You meet three Logicians named Ari, Bea, and Cal. Ari says, 'Bea is a Liar.' Bea says, 'Cal is an Alternator.' Cal says, 'Ari is not a Truth-teller.' If exactly one person from each tribe is present, determine which tribe each person belongs to.",
  "answer": "Let's analyze the statements one by one and explore the possibilities.\n\n1. First, let's list all the possible tribe assignments (ordering as Ari, Bea, Cal):\n   - Truth-teller, Liar, Alternator\n   - Truth-teller, Alternator, Liar\n   - Liar, Truth-teller, Alternator\n   - Liar, Alternator, Truth-teller\n   - Alternator, Truth-teller, Liar\n   - Alternator, Liar, Truth-teller\n\n2. Let's examine Ari's statement: 'Bea is a Liar.'\n   - If Ari is a Truth-teller, then Bea must be a Liar.\n   - If Ari is a Liar, then Bea is not a Liar (so either Truth-teller or Alternator).\n   - If Ari is an Alternator, this is Ari's first statement, so it must be true. Therefore, Bea must be a Liar.\n\n3. Now examine Bea's statement: 'Cal is an Alternator.'\n   - If Bea is a Truth-teller, then Cal must be an Alternator.\n   - If Bea is a Liar, then Cal is not an Alternator (so either Truth-teller or Liar).\n   - If Bea is an Alternator, this is Bea's first statement, so it must be true. Therefore, Cal must be an Alternator.\n\n4. Finally, look at Cal's statement: 'Ari is not a Truth-teller.'\n   - If Cal is a Truth-teller, then Ari is not a Truth-teller (so either Liar or Alternator).\n   - If Cal is a Liar, then Ari is a Truth-teller.\n   - If Cal is an Alternator, this is Cal's first statement, so it must be true. Therefore, Ari is not a Truth-teller.\n\n5. Let's check each possible assignment:\n\n   - Truth-teller, Liar, Alternator:\n     Ari (Truth-teller) says Bea is a Liar - True \u2713\n     Bea (Liar) says Cal is an Alternator - False \u2717 (But Bea is a Liar, so this is consistent)\n     Cal (Alternator) says Ari is not a Truth-teller - False \u2717 (This is Cal's first statement, so it should be true)\n     This assignment is inconsistent.\n\n   - Liar, Truth-teller, Alternator:\n     Ari (Liar) says Bea is a Liar - False \u2717 (But Ari is a Liar, so this is consistent)\n     Bea (Truth-teller) says Cal is an Alternator - True \u2713\n     Cal (Alternator) says Ari is not a Truth-teller - True \u2713\n     This assignment is consistent.\n\n   Checking the remaining options would show inconsistencies. Therefore, Ari is a Liar, Bea is a Truth-teller, and Cal is an Alternator."
