  "question": "A deck contains only 10 cards: 5 red cards and 5 black cards. Two cards are drawn from the deck one after another without replacement. If the first card drawn is red, what is the probability that the second card drawn is also red?",
  "answer": "To solve this problem, we need to recognize that this is a case of dependent events, since drawing a card changes the composition of the deck for the next draw.\n\nStep 1: Identify what we know.\n- Initially, there are 5 red cards and 5 black cards (10 total).\n- The first card drawn is red.\n\nStep 2: After drawing the first red card, determine the new composition of the deck.\n- There are now 4 red cards remaining.\n- There are still 5 black cards.\n- Total cards remaining: 9 cards.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the probability of drawing a red card on the second draw.\n- Probability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)\n- Probability = (Number of red cards remaining) / (Total cards remaining)\n- Probability = 4/9 \u2248 0.444 or about 44.4%\n\nThe key insight is that the events are dependent because the first draw affects the probability of the second draw. If the cards were drawn with replacement (putting the first card back before drawing the second), the events would be independent, and the probability would remain at 5/10 = 0.5 or 50%."
