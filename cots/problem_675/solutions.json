Two cards are drawn from the deck one after another without replacement. If the first card drawn is red, what is the probability that the second card drawn is also red? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this probability problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.\n\nThe problem says: \"A deck contains only 10 cards: 5 red cards and 5 black cards. Two cards are drawn from the deck one after another without replacement. If the first card drawn is red, what is the probability that the second card drawn is also red?\"\n\nOkay, so we have a deck with 10 cards total\u20145 red and 5 black. We're going to draw two cards one after the other, without putting the first one back. And the question is, given that the first card is red, what's the probability the second one is also red?\n\nHmm, probability problems can sometimes be tricky, but let's break it down. I remember that probability is about the chance of something happening, calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes. But in this case, it's a conditional probability because we're given that the first card is red, and we need to find the probability that the second card is also red under that condition.\n\nSo, conditional probability formula is: P(A|B) = P(A \u2229 B) / P(B). In this case, A is the event that the second card is red, and B is the event that the first card is red. So, we need to find P(A|B) = P(Second red | First red).\n\nBut maybe I don't need to use the formula directly. Since we're given that the first card is red, maybe it's simpler to think about it in terms of the remaining cards after the first draw.\n\nLet me think. So, initially, there are 10 cards: 5 red and 5 black. When we draw the first card and it's red, we know that we've removed one red card from the deck. So, now, there are 4 red cards left and still 5 black cards. So, the deck now has 9 cards left.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the second card is red is the number of remaining red cards divided by the total number of remaining cards.\n\nSo, number of red cards left = 5 - 1 = 4.\n\nTotal number of cards left = 10 - 1 = 9.\n\nSo, the probability would be 4/9.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Maybe I should approach it using combinations to double-check.\n\nIn probability, sometimes it's good to confirm using different methods.\n\nThe total number of ways to draw two cards from the deck is the combination of 10 cards taken 2 at a time, which is 10 choose 2. That's 10! / (2! * (10-2)!) = (10*9)/2 = 45 possible outcomes.\n\nBut since we're given that the first card is red, we need to adjust the sample space accordingly. So, how many ways are there to draw two cards where the first is red?\n\nWell, there are 5 red cards. So, the first card is red, and then the second card can be any of the remaining 9 cards. But wait, the second card can be either red or black.\n\nSo, the number of favorable outcomes where the first is red and the second is also red is 5 red cards for the first draw, and then 4 red cards left for the second draw. So, 5 * 4 = 20 possible favorable outcomes.\n\nBut wait, in terms of combinations, since we're dealing with two draws in sequence, is it 5*4 or 5 choose 1 * 4 choose 1? Yeah, that's the same as 20.\n\nAlternatively, in combinations, the number of ways to choose two red cards is 5 choose 2, which is 10. But wait, that's if we're not considering the order. But in this problem, we are considering the order because we're drawing one after another. So, the first card is red, and the second is red. So, it's 5 options for the first card and 4 for the second, so 20 ordered pairs.\n\nThe total number of possible ordered pairs where the first card is red is 5 (first card) * 9 (second card) = 45.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because 5*9 is 45, but we already have 10 choose 2 is 45, which is the total number of two-card draws without considering order. Hmm, so perhaps this approach is getting a bit confusing.\n\nLet me think again. When we're dealing with conditional probability, sometimes it's better to use combinations, sometimes to use sequential draws.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think in terms of probabilities step by step.\n\nThe probability that the first card is red is 5/10, which simplifies to 1/2. But we're given that the first card is red, so we don't need to consider that in our final probability, but it's part of the condition.\n\nNow, given that the first card is red, the deck now has 9 cards left, with 4 red and 5 black.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the second card is red is 4/9.\n\nSo, that seems straightforward. But let me confirm using combinations to make sure.\n\nThe total number of ways to draw two cards where the first is red is 5 (choices for first card) * 9 (remaining cards) = 45. But wait, that can't be right because 5*9 is 45, which is equal to the total number of two-card draws, which is also 45. So, that makes sense because for each two-card draw, there are two possible orders: (red, red), (red, black), (black, red), (black, black). But since we're given that the first card is red, we're only considering the cases where the first is red, which are (red, red) and (red, black). So, the number of favorable outcomes is 5*4 + 5*5 = 20 + 25 = 45. Wait, that can't be right because 5*4 + 5*5 is 45, which is the total number of two-card draws, so that would mean that all two-card draws have the first card red. That can't be true.\n\nWait, I think I messed up here. Let me try again.\n\nIf we consider all possible two-card draws where the first card is red, the number of such draws is 5 (choices for first red card) * 9 (choices for the second card), but the second card can be either red or black.\n\nSo, the number of such draws is 5*9 = 45, but that's the same as the total number of two-card draws, which is 45. That can't be, because in reality, some two-card draws have the first card red and the second card black, and some have the first card black and the second card red.\n\nWait, no. Actually, when we think about all possible ordered two-card draws, the total number is 10*9 = 90, because for each of the 10 cards, there are 9 possible next cards. So, the total number of ordered two-card draws is 90.\n\nIn that case, the number of ordered two-card draws where the first card is red is 5*9 = 45, as the first card can be any of the 5 red cards, and the second card can be any of the remaining 9 cards.\n\nSimilarly, the number of ordered two-card draws where the first card is red and the second card is also red is 5*4 = 20, because after drawing the first red card, there are 4 red cards left.\n\nSimilarly, the number of ordered two-card draws where the first card is red and the second is black is 5*5 = 25, since after drawing a red card, there are still 5 black cards left.\n\nSo, the total number of ordered two-card draws is 20 (both red) + 25 (red then black) = 45, but wait, that's only 45, but we know the total is 90. So, where's the mistake here?\n\nOh, right, because when we fix the first card as red, the second card can be either red or black, but when we consider all possible ordered draws, the first card can also be black. So, the total number of ordered draws where the first card is red is 5*9 = 45, and the number where the first card is black is 5*9 = 45 as well, making the total 90.\n\nSo, within the 45 ordered draws where the first card is red, 20 of them have the second card red, and 25 have the second card black.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the second card is red given that the first is red is the number of favorable outcomes (20) divided by the number of possible outcomes under the condition (45).\n\nSo, 20/45 simplifies to 4/9.\n\nThat matches the earlier result.\n\nAlternatively, using combinations: the number of ways to choose two red cards in order is 5*4 = 20. The number of ways to choose any two cards in order is 10*9 = 90. But we're given that the first card is red, so we're restricting the sample space to 5*9 = 45 ordered draws.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 20/45 = 4/9.\n\nSo, both methods give me the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nAnother way to think about it is using probability rules. The probability that the second card is red given that the first was red is equal to the number of red cards remaining divided by the total number of cards remaining.\n\nSo, initially, 5 red and 5 black. After drawing one red, there are 4 red and 5 black left, making 9 cards total.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 4/9.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nI think I've covered it from multiple angles now. All methods point to the probability being 4/9.\n</think>\n\nThe probability that the second card drawn is red, given that the first card was red, is 4/9.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Understand the Problem:**\n   - Deck has 10 cards: 5 red (R) and 5 black (B).\n   - Draw two cards without replacement.\n   - Given that the first card is red, find the probability the second is also red.\n\n2. **Determine Remaining Cards After First Draw:**\n   - First card is red, so remaining cards: 4 red and 5 black, totaling 9 cards.\n\n3. **Calculate Probability:**\n   - Number of favorable outcomes (second card red): 4.\n   - Total possible outcomes for second card: 9.\n   - Probability = 4/9.\n\n**Answer:** The probability is 4/9.\n\nDONE."

Two cards are drawn from the deck one after another without replacement. If the first card drawn is red, what is the probability that the second card drawn is also red? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this probability problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.\n\nThe problem says: \"A deck contains only 10 cards: 5 red cards and 5 black cards. Two cards are drawn from the deck one after another without replacement. If the first card drawn is red, what is the probability that the second card drawn is also red?\"\n\nOkay, so we have a deck with 10 cards total, half red and half black. We're drawing two cards without replacement, meaning once a card is drawn, it's not put back into the deck. The first card drawn is red, and we need to find the probability that the second card is also red.\n\nHmm, this sounds like a conditional probability problem because we're given that the first card is red, and we need to find the probability of the second card being red given that information.\n\nI remember something about conditional probability from my studies. It's about the probability of an event occurring given that another event has already occurred. The formula for conditional probability is:\n\nP(B|A) = P(A and B) / P(A)\n\nWhere:\n- P(B|A) is the probability of event B occurring given that A has occurred.\n- P(A and B) is the probability of both A and B occurring.\n- P(A) is the probability of event A occurring.\n\nIn this problem:\n- Event A is drawing a red card first.\n- Event B is drawing a red card second.\n\nSo, we need to find P(Red second | Red first).\n\nUsing the conditional probability formula, that would be:\n\nP(Red second | Red first) = P(Red first and Red second) / P(Red first)\n\nAlright, let's figure out each part.\n\nFirst, let's find P(Red first), which is the probability that the first card drawn is red.\n\nSince there are 5 red cards out of 10 total, the probability is 5/10, which simplifies to 1/2.\n\nNow, P(Red first and Red second) is the probability that both the first and second cards are red. Since we're drawing without replacement, the number of red cards decreases by one after the first draw.\n\nSo, initially, there are 5 red cards. If we draw one red card first, there are now 4 red cards left out of the remaining 9 cards.\n\nTherefore, P(Red first and Red second) = (Number of ways to draw 2 red cards in order) divided by (Total number of ways to draw 2 cards in order).\n\nWait, actually, another way to think about it is sequentially. Since we're drawing without replacement, the probability of the second card being red given that the first was red is equal to the number of remaining red cards divided by the number of remaining cards.\n\nSo, after drawing one red card, there are 4 red cards left and 9 cards left in total.\n\nTherefore, P(Red second | Red first) = 4/9.\n\nAlternatively, using the conditional probability formula:\n\nP(Red second | Red first) = P(Red first and Red second) / P(Red first)\n\nWe already know P(Red first) is 1/2.\n\nTo find P(Red first and Red second), it's the probability that both events happen in sequence. Since the draws are dependent (without replacement), it's the probability that the first is red and the second is also red given the first was red.\n\nSo, P(Red first and Red second) = P(Red second | Red first) * P(Red first)\n\nBut that's circular because we're trying to find P(Red second | Red first). So, perhaps it's better to approach it directly.\n\nTotal number of possible outcomes when drawing two cards: since the first card can be any of the 10, and the second card can be any of the remaining 9, the total number of ordered outcomes is 10 * 9 = 90.\n\nBut since we're dealing with probabilities, we can also think in terms of combinations. The number of ways to draw 2 red cards is C(5,2) = 10. The total number of ways to draw any 2 cards from 10 is C(10,2) = 45. But wait, that's combinations, not considering order.\n\nHowever, in probability, sometimes it's easier to think in terms of ordered outcomes, especially when dealing with sequential events.\n\nSo, considering ordered outcomes, the total number is 10 * 9 = 90.\n\nThe number of favorable outcomes where both cards are red: first card red, second card red. Since there are 5 red cards, the first red card can be any of the 5, and the second red card can be any of the remaining 4. So, 5 * 4 = 20 favorable ordered outcomes.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 20/90, which simplifies to 2/9.\n\nWait, that's different from what I thought earlier. Earlier, I thought it was 4/9, but now, using this approach, I get 2/9.\n\nWait, that can't be right because intuitively, if the first card is red, the probability the second is also red should be less than 1/2, but 4/9 is approximately 0.444, and 2/9 is approximately 0.222. Which one is correct?\n\nI think I made a mistake in one of the methods.\n\nLet me clarify.\n\nMethod 1: Using conditional probability.\n\nGiven that the first card is red, there are 4 red cards left out of 9 remaining cards. Therefore, the probability the second card is red is 4/9.\n\nMethod 2: Calculating the joint probability.\n\nP(Red first and Red second) is the probability that both are red in sequence.\n\nSince the first card is red, which is 5/10 = 1/2.\n\nThen, given that the first card is red, the second card being red is 4/9.\n\nTherefore, P(Red first and Red second) = (1/2) * (4/9) = 4/18 = 2/9.\n\nAlternatively, using ordered outcomes:\n\nTotal ordered outcomes: 10 * 9 = 90.\n\nFavorable outcomes: 5 choices for the first red card, 4 choices for the second red card: 5 * 4 = 20.\n\nSo, probability is 20/90 = 2/9.\n\nWait, so both methods give 2/9, but earlier I thought it was 4/9. I must have confused something.\n\nWait, no, actually, if I think of it as conditional probability, it's 4/9, but when calculating the joint probability, it's 2/9.\n\nBut that can't be because conditional probability should equal joint probability divided by the probability of the condition.\n\nWait, let me write it down.\n\nLet A be the first card is red.\n\nLet B be the second card is red.\n\nWe need P(B|A) = P(A and B)/P(A).\n\nWe have:\n\nP(A) = 5/10 = 1/2.\n\nP(A and B) is the probability that both cards are red, which is (5/10)*(4/9) = 1/2 * 4/9 = 4/18 = 2/9.\n\nTherefore, P(B|A) = (2/9)/(1/2) = (2/9)*(2/1) = 4/9.\n\nAh, so that's correct. So, earlier, when I thought of it as 4/9, that's correct, and when I did the ordered outcomes, I must have done something wrong.\n\nWait, in the ordered outcomes, I considered the first card as red, so the second card is red.\n\nBut if we consider all possible ordered outcomes where the first card is red, then the number of such outcomes is 5 * 9 = 45 (since the first card is red, and the second can be any of the remaining 9 cards).\n\nOut of these 45, how many have the second card also red? It's 5 * 4 = 20, as before.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 20/45 = 4/9.\n\nAh, that's correct. So, when considering only the cases where the first card is red, the total number of such cases is 5 * 9 = 45, and the number of favorable cases is 5 * 4 = 20. So, 20/45 = 4/9.\n\nTherefore, the correct probability is 4/9.\n\nI think I confused myself earlier by considering the entire sample space, but in conditional probability, we should only consider the cases where the condition is met, i.e., the first card is red.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\nGiven that the first card is red, there are 4 red cards left and 9 cards left in total.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the second card is red is 4/9.\n\nAlternatively, using the conditional probability formula:\n\nP(Red second | Red first) = (Number of red cards left) / (Total number of cards left) = 4/9.\n\nSo, the final answer is 4/9.\n</think>\n\nThe probability that the second card drawn is red, given that the first card was red, is 4/9.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Understand the Problem:**\n   - Deck has 10 cards: 5 red (R) and 5 black (B).\n   - Two cards are drawn without replacement.\n   - Given that the first card is red, find the probability the second card is also red.\n\n2. **Identify the Sample Space:**\n   - Total cards = 10.\n   - First card is red: 5 options.\n   - After drawing one red, 4 red and 5 black remain, total 9 cards.\n\n3. **Apply Conditional Probability:**\n   - Probability the second card is red given the first was red.\n   - Formula: P(Red2 | Red1) = (Number of remaining red cards) / (Total remaining cards) = 4/9.\n\n**Answer:** The probability is 4/9.\n\nDONE."
