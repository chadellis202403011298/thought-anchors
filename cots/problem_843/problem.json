  "question": "A man needs to transport a wolf, a goat, and a cabbage across a river. He has a small boat that can only carry himself and one item at a time. If left unattended together, the wolf would eat the goat, and the goat would eat the cabbage. How can the man transport all three items across the river without any of them being eaten?",
  "answer": "This problem requires thinking beyond the obvious sequential approach. Here's the solution:\n\n1. First, the man takes the goat across the river, leaving the wolf and cabbage behind. This is safe because the wolf won't eat the cabbage.\n\n2. The man returns to the original side alone.\n\n3. Next, the man takes the wolf across the river. Now the wolf and goat would be together on the far side, which is dangerous.\n\n4. So, the man brings the goat back with him to the original side. Now the wolf is alone on the far side, and the man, goat, and cabbage are on the original side.\n\n5. The man then takes the cabbage across the river, leaving it with the wolf (which is safe) on the far side.\n\n6. Finally, the man returns alone to the original side and takes the goat across the river.\n\nNow all three items are safely on the far side of the river. The key insight was recognizing that it's sometimes necessary to undo previous progress (bringing the goat back) to ultimately reach the goal."
