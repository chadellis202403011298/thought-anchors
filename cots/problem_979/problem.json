  "question": "Consider the following sentence: 'The store had fewer customers than usual, yet sales were surprisingly high.' Which of these interpretations most logically follows from this statement?\n\nA) The store lowered its prices to attract more customers.\nB) The customers who visited purchased more items than usual.\nC) The store normally has high sales regardless of customer count.\nD) The store must have sold particularly expensive items that day.",
  "answer": "The correct answer is B) The customers who visited purchased more items than usual.\n\nLet's analyze the original statement step by step:\n\n1. 'The store had fewer customers than usual' - This tells us the number of people visiting the store decreased.\n\n2. 'yet sales were surprisingly high' - The word 'yet' indicates a contrast between the two parts of the sentence. It shows that high sales would not normally be expected when customer count is low.\n\n3. If there are fewer customers but sales are high, then logically, each customer on average must have contributed more to the total sales than they typically would.\n\nOption A suggests lowering prices, but this isn't implied in the statement and might actually lead to lower overall sales despite attracting customers.\n\nOption B directly addresses the apparent contradiction: fewer customers but higher sales means each customer must have purchased more on average.\n\nOption C contradicts the statement's surprise at high sales. If high sales were normal regardless of customer count, there would be nothing surprising about it.\n\nOption D suggests selling expensive items, which could be true, but isn't necessarily the most logical conclusion. High sales could come from customers buying more items of regular price rather than expensive items specifically."
