  "question": "Four 3D objects are shown below as flat projections. Three of these objects are identical but viewed from different angles. One object is different from the rest. Which one is different?\n\nA: A cube with a small cylinder protruding from one face\nB: A cube with a small cylinder protruding from one face\nC: A cube with a small cylinder protruding from one edge\nD: A cube with a small cylinder protruding from one face",
  "answer": "The different object is C.\n\nStep 1: Analyze each description carefully to understand the spatial configuration of each object.\nObjects A, B, and D all describe a cube with a small cylinder protruding from one face (or side) of the cube.\nObject C describes a cube with a small cylinder protruding from one edge of the cube.\n\nStep 2: Visualize the objects mentally.\nWhen a cylinder protrudes from a face of a cube, it extends perpendicular to one of the six flat surfaces of the cube.\nWhen a cylinder protrudes from an edge of a cube, it extends outward from one of the twelve edges where two faces of the cube meet.\n\nStep 3: Compare the visualizations.\nNo matter how you rotate objects A, B, and D, you cannot make a cylinder protruding from a face look like a cylinder protruding from an edge. These are fundamentally different spatial configurations.\n\nStep 4: Identify the different object.\nSince objects A, B, and D all have the cylinder protruding from a face while only object C has the cylinder protruding from an edge, object C is the different one."
