Determine the value that each symbol represents. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I've got this puzzle here with some symbols and equations, and I need to figure out what each symbol stands for and then find the value of \u25cb\u25a1\u2295. Let me take it step by step.\n\nFirst, let me write down the equations as they are:\n\n1. \u2295\u25ca\u25a1 = 21\n2. \u25a1\u25ca\u25b3 = 14\n3. \u25b3\u2295\u25cb = 16\n4. \u25cb\u25a1\u2295 = ? \n\nOkay, so we have four symbols: \u2295, \u25ca, \u25a1, and \u25b3. Each of these symbols represents a unique digit, right? Because the results are numbers: 21, 14, 16, and we need to find \u25cb\u25a1\u2295. So, each symbol is a digit from 0 to 9, and they're all different.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. Since all the equations involve three symbols, maybe I can find relationships between them. Let's see.\n\nStarting with the first equation: \u2295\u25ca\u25a1 = 21. So, the combination of these three symbols adds up to 21. Similarly, the second equation: \u25a1\u25ca\u25b3 = 14. Third equation: \u25b3\u2295\u25cb = 16. And we need to find \u25cb\u25a1\u2295.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can express some symbols in terms of others. Let me try to express each symbol in terms of another.\n\nFrom equation 3: \u25b3\u2295\u25cb = 16. Let me solve for one of these. Maybe \u25b3 = 16 - \u2295 - \u25cb? But I don't know what \u2295 or \u25cb is yet. Alternatively, I can think that \u25b3 is a digit, so it can only be from 0 to 9. Same with the others.\n\nLet me consider the digits that add up to 21, 14, and 16. Since 21 is the largest sum, maybe some of the symbols are larger digits.\n\nLet's think about equation 1: \u2295\u25ca\u25a1 = 21. The maximum sum of three digits is 9+9+9=27, so 21 is possible. Possible combinations could be 9,8,4 because 9+8+4=21. Or maybe 9,7,5, but 9+7+5=21. Alternatively, 9,9,3 but they have to be unique symbols, so maybe not. Wait, but the symbols are unique, so each symbol is a different digit.\n\nWait, actually, the problem doesn't specify whether the symbols must be unique digits or not. Hmm, but usually in these puzzles, each symbol is a unique digit. So, I think that's a safe assumption.\n\nSo, each symbol is a unique digit from 0 to 9.\n\nLet me note that:\n\nFrom equation 1: \u2295 + \u25ca + \u25a1 = 21.\n\nFrom equation 2: \u25a1 + \u25ca + \u25b3 = 14.\n\nFrom equation 3: \u25b3 + \u2295 + \u25cb = 16.\n\nWe need to find \u25cb + \u25a1 + \u2295.\n\nSo, let's denote:\n\nEquation 1: A + B + C = 21 (where A=\u2295, B=\u25ca, C=\u25a1)\n\nEquation 2: C + B + D = 14 (where D=\u25b3)\n\nEquation 3: D + A + E = 16 (where E=\u25cb)\n\nAnd we need to find E + C + A.\n\nSo, let's write them as:\n\n1. A + B + C = 21\n\n2. B + C + D = 14\n\n3. D + A + E = 16\n\nWe have four equations and five variables, but we need to find E + C + A.\n\nHmm, maybe we can subtract some equations to find relationships between variables.\n\nLet me subtract equation 2 from equation 1:\n\n(A + B + C) - (B + C + D) = 21 - 14\n\nSimplifying:\n\nA - D = 7 => A = D + 7\n\nSo, that's interesting. A is 7 more than D.\n\nFrom equation 3: D + A + E = 16\n\nBut since A = D + 7, substitute into equation 3:\n\nD + (D + 7) + E = 16\n\nSimplify:\n\n2D + 7 + E = 16 => 2D + E = 9\n\nSo, equation 4: 2D + E = 9\n\nNow, from equation 2: B + C + D = 14\n\nFrom equation 1: A + B + C = 21, and since A = D + 7, equation 1 becomes:\n\n(D + 7) + B + C = 21 => D + B + C = 14\n\nWait, that's the same as equation 2: B + C + D =14.\n\nSo, that's consistent. So, equation 1 and 2 are related through A = D +7.\n\nSo, now, our variables are:\n\nA = D +7\n\nE = 9 - 2D\n\nAnd we have equation 2: B + C + D =14\n\nAnd equation 1: A + B + C =21, which we already used.\n\nSo, let's think about possible values for D.\n\nSince D is a digit, D can be from 0 to 9, but let's see.\n\nFrom E = 9 - 2D, and E must be a digit (0-9). So:\n\n9 - 2D \u2265 0 => 2D \u22649 => D \u22644.5, so D can be 0,1,2,3,4.\n\nSimilarly, since A = D +7, and A must be a digit (0-9):\n\nD +7 \u22649 => D \u22642\n\nSo, D can be 0,1,2.\n\nLet me consider D=0:\n\nIf D=0,\n\nThen A=0+7=7\n\nE=9 - 0=9\n\nThen, equation 2: B + C + 0=14 => B + C=14\n\nBut from equation 1: A + B + C=21 =>7 + B + C=21 => B + C=14, which matches equation 2.\n\nSo, B + C=14.\n\nWe need to find B and C such that they are unique digits, different from A=7, D=0, E=9.\n\nSo, digits used so far: 0,7,9.\n\nSo, B and C must be different from 0,7,9.\n\nPossible pairs for B and C that add to 14:\n\nLooking for two different digits, neither 0,7,9.\n\nPossible pairs:\n\n5 and 9: but 9 is used.\n\n6 and 8: both are available.\n\n7 and 7: same digit, not allowed.\n\nSo, only 6 and 8.\n\nSo, B and C could be 6 and 8.\n\nSo, let's see:\n\nIf B=6, C=8\n\nOr B=8, C=6.\n\nEither way, they are different.\n\nSo, let's check if all symbols are unique.\n\nA=7, D=0, E=9, B=6, C=8.\n\nAll unique, so that's possible.\n\nSo, with D=0, let's see:\n\n\u25b3=D=0\n\n\u2295=A=7\n\n\u25ca=B=6 or 8\n\n\u25a1=C=8 or 6\n\n\u25cb=E=9\n\nSo, then, we can compute \u25cb\u25a1\u2295= E + C + A.\n\nWhich is 9 + C +7.\n\nIf C=8: 9+8+7=24\n\nIf C=6:9+6+7=22\n\nWait, but we need to confirm which one is correct.\n\nWait, let's see if this fits into equation 3: \u25b3\u2295\u25cb=16\n\n\u25b3=0, \u2295=7, \u25cb=9.\n\nSo, 0 +7 +9=16? 0+7=7, 7+9=16. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, that works.\n\nSo, with D=0, we have a solution.\n\nBut let's check other possible D values.\n\nD=1:\n\nThen A=1+7=8\n\nE=9-2*1=7\n\nThen, equation 2: B + C +1=14 => B + C=13\n\nEquation 1: A + B + C=21 =>8 + B + C=21 => B + C=13, which matches.\n\nSo, B + C=13.\n\nDigits used so far: A=8, D=1, E=7\n\nSo, B and C must be unique digits, not 1,7,8.\n\nPossible pairs for B and C adding to 13:\n\n4 and 9: 4 and 9. Are they available? 9 is not used yet.\n\n5 and 8: 8 is used.\n\n6 and7:7 is used.\n\n3 and10: 10 is not a digit.\n\nSo, only possible pair is 4 and9.\n\nSo, B=4, C=9 or B=9, C=4.\n\nBut wait, E=7, so 7 is already used.\n\nSo, if C=9, which is not used yet, that's okay.\n\nSo, let's check:\n\nIf B=4, C=9.\n\nDigits used: A=8, D=1, E=7, B=4, C=9. All unique.\n\nCheck equation 3: \u25b3\u2295\u25cb=1 +8 +7=16? 1+8=9, 9+7=16. Yes, correct.\n\nSo, that works as well.\n\nSo, in this case, \u25cb=E=7, \u25a1=C=9, \u2295=A=8.\n\nSo, \u25cb\u25a1\u2295=7 +9 +8=24.\n\nWait, same as before.\n\nAlternatively, if B=9, C=4.\n\nThen, digits used: A=8, D=1, E=7, B=9, C=4. Also unique.\n\nEquation 3: \u25b3\u2295\u25cb=1 +8 +7=16. Correct.\n\nSo, in both cases, \u25cb\u25a1\u2295=24.\n\nWait, same as before.\n\nHmm, interesting.\n\nNow, check D=2:\n\nA=2+7=9\n\nE=9-2*2=5\n\nEquation 2: B + C +2=14 => B + C=12\n\nEquation 1: A + B + C=21 =>9 + B + C=21 => B + C=12, which matches.\n\nSo, B + C=12.\n\nDigits used so far: A=9, D=2, E=5.\n\nSo, B and C must be unique digits, not 2,5,9.\n\nPossible pairs for B and C adding to12:\n\n3 and9: 9 is used.\n\n4 and8: both available.\n\n5 and7:5 is used.\n\n6 and6: same digit.\n\nSo, only possible pair is4 and8.\n\nSo, B=4, C=8 or B=8, C=4.\n\nCheck equation 3: \u25b3\u2295\u25cb=2 +9 +5=16? 2+9=11, 11+5=16. Yes, correct.\n\nSo, that works.\n\nSo, in this case:\n\nIf B=4, C=8:\n\nDigits used: A=9, D=2, E=5, B=4, C=8. All unique.\n\nCompute \u25cb\u25a1\u2295= E + C + A=5 +8 +9=22.\n\nAlternatively, if B=8, C=4:\n\nDigits used: A=9, D=2, E=5, B=8, C=4. All unique.\n\nCompute \u25cb\u25a1\u2295=5 +4 +9=18.\n\nWait, but we need to check which one is correct.\n\nWait, but in equation 1: \u2295\u25ca\u25a1=A + B + C=9 +8 +4=21 or 9 +4 +8=21. Both are same.\n\nBut equation 2: \u25a1\u25ca\u25b3=C + B + D=8 +4 +2=14 or 4 +8 +2=14. Same.\n\nEquation3: \u25b3\u2295\u25cb=2 +9 +5=16. Same.\n\nSo, both possibilities are valid.\n\nWait, but in the second case, when B=8, C=4, then \u25cb\u25a1\u2295=5 +4 +9=18.\n\nBut in the first case, when B=4, C=8, it's 5 +8 +9=22.\n\nSo, which one is correct?\n\nHmm, we need more information.\n\nWait, let's check if all symbols are unique in both cases.\n\nIn the first case:\n\nA=9, B=4, C=8, D=2, E=5.\n\nAll unique: 9,4,8,2,5. Yes.\n\nIn the second case:\n\nA=9, B=8, C=4, D=2, E=5.\n\nAlso unique:9,8,4,2,5. Yes.\n\nSo, both are valid.\n\nBut wait, the problem is that we have two different possibilities for \u25cb\u25a1\u2295:18 and22.\n\nBut in the first case (D=0), we had \u25cb\u25a1\u2295=24.\n\nIn D=1, it's 24.\n\nIn D=2, it's 18 or22.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"a certain symbolic system\", so maybe there is only one solution.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let's check for D=2.\n\nIf B=4, C=8, then:\n\nEquation 1: A=9, B=4, C=8: 9+4+8=21. Correct.\n\nEquation2: C + B + D=8 +4 +2=14. Correct.\n\nEquation3: D + A + E=2 +9 +5=16. Correct.\n\nSo, all equations are satisfied.\n\nSimilarly, if B=8, C=4:\n\nEquation1:9 +8 +4=21.\n\nEquation2:4 +8 +2=14.\n\nEquation3:2 +9 +5=16.\n\nAll correct.\n\nSo, both are valid, but the value of \u25cb\u25a1\u2295 is different.\n\nHmm, so how do we know which one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps there is another constraint I'm missing.\n\nLet me think about the digits used.\n\nIn the D=2 case, with B=4, C=8, E=5.\n\nSo, symbols:\n\n\u2295=9, \u25ca=4, \u25a1=8, \u25b3=2, \u25cb=5.\n\nSo, digits used: 2,4,5,8,9.\n\nAll unique.\n\nSimilarly, with B=8, C=4, E=5.\n\n\u2295=9, \u25ca=8, \u25a1=4, \u25b3=2, \u25cb=5.\n\nDigits used:2,4,5,8,9.\n\nSame.\n\nSo, both are valid.\n\nBut the problem states \"a certain symbolic system\", implying that the symbols have fixed meanings, so there should be only one solution.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a wrong assumption earlier.\n\nWait, in D=2 case, when B=8, C=4, then in equation2: \u25a1=4, \u25ca=8, \u25b3=2: 4 +8 +2=14.\n\nBut in equation1: \u2295=9, \u25ca=8, \u25a1=4:9+8+4=21.\n\nEquation3: \u25b3=2, \u2295=9, \u25cb=5:2+9+5=16.\n\nYes, all correct.\n\nBut in the first case, when D=0, we have:\n\n\u2295=7, \u25ca=6, \u25a1=8, \u25b3=0, \u25cb=9.\n\nEquation1:7+6+8=21.\n\nEquation2:8+6+0=14.\n\nEquation3:0+7+9=16.\n\nYes, all correct.\n\nSimilarly, in D=1 case:\n\n\u2295=8, \u25ca=4, \u25a1=9, \u25b3=1, \u25cb=7.\n\nEquation1:8+4+9=21.\n\nEquation2:9+4+1=14.\n\nEquation3:1+8+7=16.\n\nCorrect.\n\nSo, all three cases are valid.\n\nBut the problem asks for \"a certain symbolic system\", implying that the symbols correspond to unique digits, but maybe the system allows for multiple solutions, but the question is to find one possible value.\n\nBut the question is: \"What number does \u25cb\u25a1\u2295 equal?\" So, perhaps in each case, it's different, but maybe the problem expects the minimal or something.\n\nWait, but in the D=0 case, \u25cb\u25a1\u2295=9+8+7=24.\n\nIn D=1 case, it's 7+9+8=24.\n\nWait, no, in D=1 case, E=7, C=9, A=8: 7+9+8=24.\n\nIn D=2 case, when B=4, C=8, E=5:5+8+9=22.\n\nWhen B=8, C=4, E=5:5+4+9=18.\n\nSo, possible values:18,22,24.\n\nBut the problem is likely expecting one answer, so perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, maybe I should check if in D=2 case, whether E=5 is a digit, which it is.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the symbols must be in a certain order, but I don't think so.\n\nWait, maybe the symbols must be in increasing or decreasing order? But the problem doesn't say that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that in equation3: \u25b3\u2295\u25cb=16, which is 16, so the sum of three digits is 16.\n\nSo, in D=0 case:0+7+9=16.\n\nIn D=1:1+8+7=16.\n\nIn D=2:2+9+5=16.\n\nSo, all correct.\n\nBut the problem is that we have multiple possible solutions, leading to different values for \u25cb\u25a1\u2295.\n\nBut the problem is presented as a single answer, so perhaps I made a wrong assumption earlier.\n\nWait, maybe the symbols must be unique, but perhaps the problem allows for symbols to be the same digit, but the equations would have to still hold.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"each symbol represents\", implying unique digits.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that in the D=2 case, when B=8 and C=4, then in equation2: \u25a1=4, which is less than \u25b3=2? No, because 4>2.\n\nWait, no, the order doesn't matter. The equations are about the sum, not the order.\n\nSo, perhaps both are valid.\n\nBut the problem is expecting a single answer, so maybe I should look back.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed that in equation1, \u2295\u25ca\u25a1="

I need to figure out what each symbol stands for and then find the value of \u25cb\u25a1\u2295. Let me take it step by step.\n\nFirst, the equations given are:\n\n1. \u2295\u25ca\u25a1 = 21\n2. \u25a1\u25ca\u25b3 = 14\n3. \u25b3\u2295\u25cb = 16\n4. \u25cb\u25a1\u2295 = ?\n\nHmm, okay. So, there are four symbols here: \u2295, \u25ca, \u25a1, and \u25b3. Each of them probably represents a single digit, right? Since the results are numbers like 21, 14, and 16. So, I can assume that each symbol is a digit from 0 to 9.\n\nLet me list out what I know:\n\n- From the first equation: \u2295 + \u25ca + \u25a1 = 21\n- From the second equation: \u25a1 + \u25ca + \u25b3 = 14\n- From the third equation: \u25b3 + \u2295 + \u25cb = 16\n\nAnd I need to find \u25cb + \u25a1 + \u2295.\n\nSo, I have three equations with four variables. That might be a bit tricky, but maybe I can find some relationships between them.\n\nLet me write them down again:\n\n1. \u2295 + \u25ca + \u25a1 = 21\n2. \u25a1 + \u25ca + \u25b3 = 14\n3. \u25b3 + \u2295 + \u25cb = 16\n\nI need to find \u25cb + \u25a1 + \u2295.\n\nHmm, maybe if I can express some variables in terms of others, I can substitute them.\n\nLooking at equations 1 and 2, both have \u25ca and \u25a1. Maybe I can subtract equation 2 from equation 1 to eliminate \u25ca and \u25a1.\n\nSo, equation 1 minus equation 2:\n\n(\u2295 + \u25ca + \u25a1) - (\u25a1 + \u25ca + \u25b3) = 21 - 14\n\nThat simplifies to:\n\n\u2295 - \u25b3 = 7\n\nSo, \u2295 = \u25b3 + 7\n\nThat's a useful relationship. Now, let's look at equation 3:\n\n\u25b3 + \u2295 + \u25cb = 16\n\nBut we know that \u2295 = \u25b3 + 7, so we can substitute that into equation 3:\n\n\u25b3 + (\u25b3 + 7) + \u25cb = 16\n\nSimplify that:\n\n2\u25b3 + 7 + \u25cb = 16\n\nSubtract 7 from both sides:\n\n2\u25b3 + \u25cb = 9\n\nSo, now we have 2\u25b3 + \u25cb = 9. Let's keep that in mind.\n\nNow, let's go back to equation 1: \u2295 + \u25ca + \u25a1 = 21\n\nAnd equation 2: \u25a1 + \u25ca + \u25b3 = 14\n\nI can subtract equation 2 from equation 1 again:\n\n(\u2295 + \u25ca + \u25a1) - (\u25a1 + \u25ca + \u25b3) = 21 - 14\n\nWhich gives us:\n\n\u2295 - \u25b3 = 7\n\nWait, that's the same as before. So, no new info there. Maybe I can express \u25cb in terms of \u25b3.\n\nFrom 2\u25b3 + \u25cb = 9, we can write:\n\n\u25cb = 9 - 2\u25b3\n\nSo, \u25cb is expressed in terms of \u25b3.\n\nNow, let's think about possible values for \u25b3. Since each symbol is a digit, \u25b3 must be between 0 and 9. Also, from \u2295 = \u25b3 + 7, \u2295 must be a single digit, so \u25b3 can be at most 2 because 2 + 7 = 9. So, \u25b3 can be 0, 1, or 2.\n\nLet me test each possibility.\n\nCase 1: \u25b3 = 0\n\nThen, \u2295 = 0 + 7 = 7\n\nAnd from \u25cb = 9 - 2*0 = 9\n\nSo, symbols would be:\n\n\u25b3 = 0\n\n\u2295 = 7\n\n\u25cb = 9\n\nNow, let's check equation 2: \u25a1 + \u25ca + \u25b3 = 14\n\nSo, \u25a1 + \u25ca + 0 = 14 \u2192 \u25a1 + \u25ca = 14\n\nFrom equation 1: \u2295 + \u25ca + \u25a1 = 21 \u2192 7 + \u25ca + \u25a1 = 21\n\nWe know from equation 2 that \u25a1 + \u25ca = 14, so plugging that into equation 1:\n\n7 + 14 = 21 \u2192 21 = 21, which works.\n\nSo, that's consistent. Now, we need to find \u25a1 and \u25ca such that their sum is 14.\n\nPossible pairs (since both are digits):\n\n(5,9), (6,8), (7,7), (8,6), (9,5)\n\nBut let's check if any of these cause issues with other equations.\n\nAlso, from equation 3: \u25b3 + \u2295 + \u25cb = 0 + 7 + 9 = 16, which matches.\n\nSo, possible. Now, we need to find \u25cb\u25a1\u2295.\n\n\u25cb = 9, \u25a1 = ?, \u2295 = 7\n\nSo, 9 + \u25a1 + 7 = 16 + \u25a1 = ?\n\nWait, no, we need to find \u25cb\u25a1\u2295, which is 9 + \u25a1 + 7 = 16 + \u25a1\n\nBut we don't know \u25a1 yet. However, from equation 2, \u25a1 + \u25ca =14, and from equation 1, 7 + 14=21.\n\nBut we don't have more info. So, perhaps any of these pairs would work, but we need to find a unique solution.\n\nWait, maybe there's another equation or constraint I'm missing.\n\nAlternatively, let's check other cases.\n\nCase 2: \u25b3 = 1\n\nThen, \u2295 = 1 + 7 = 8\n\nAnd \u25cb = 9 - 2*1 = 7\n\nSo, symbols:\n\n\u25b3 =1\n\n\u2295=8\n\n\u25cb=7\n\nNow, equation 2: \u25a1 + \u25ca +1 =14 \u2192 \u25a1 + \u25ca=13\n\nEquation 1:8 + \u25ca + \u25a1=21 \u2192 8 +13=21 \u2192 21=21, which works.\n\nEquation 3:1 +8 +7=16 \u2192 16=16, which works.\n\nSo, again, consistent.\n\nNow, we need to find \u25cb\u25a1\u2295 =7 + \u25a1 +8=15 + \u25a1\n\nBut from equation 2, \u25a1 + \u25ca=13\n\nSo, \u25a1 can be from 4 to 9, since digits are 0-9.\n\nBut without more info, we can't determine a unique value. Hmm.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem expects a unique solution, so perhaps only one case works.\n\nWait, let's check case 3.\n\nCase 3: \u25b3=2\n\nThen, \u2295=2+7=9\n\nAnd \u25cb=9 -2*2=9-4=5\n\nSo, symbols:\n\n\u25b3=2\n\n\u2295=9\n\n\u25cb=5\n\nEquation 2: \u25a1 + \u25ca +2=14 \u2192 \u25a1 + \u25ca=12\n\nEquation 1:9 + \u25ca + \u25a1=21 \u2192 9 +12=21 \u2192 21=21, which works.\n\nEquation 3:2 +9 +5=16 \u219216=16, which works.\n\nSo, again, consistent.\n\nNow, we need to find \u25cb\u25a1\u2295=5 + \u25a1 +9=14 + \u25a1\n\nBut from equation 2, \u25a1 + \u25ca=12\n\nSo, \u25a1 can be from 3 to 9, but again, not unique.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"determine the value that each symbol represents.\" So, it must have a unique solution. Therefore, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe I can find more constraints.\n\nLooking back, in each case, we have:\n\nIn case 1: \u25b3=0, \u2295=7, \u25cb=9, \u25a1 + \u25ca=14\n\nIn case 2: \u25b3=1, \u2295=8, \u25cb=7, \u25a1 + \u25ca=13\n\nIn case 3: \u25b3=2, \u2295=9, \u25cb=5, \u25a1 + \u25ca=12\n\nNow, let's see if any of these cases lead to a unique solution for \u25cb\u25a1\u2295.\n\nIn case 1: \u25cb=9, \u2295=7, so 9 + \u25a1 +7=16 + \u25a1\n\nBut from equation 2: \u25a1 + \u25ca=14, so \u25a1 can be 5 to 9, but without knowing \u25ca, can't determine.\n\nSimilarly, in case 2: \u25cb=7, \u2295=8, so 7 + \u25a1 +8=15 + \u25a1\n\nFrom equation 2: \u25a1 + \u25ca=13, so \u25a1 can be 4 to 9.\n\nCase 3: \u25cb=5, \u2295=9, so 5 + \u25a1 +9=14 + \u25a1\n\nFrom equation 2: \u25a1 + \u25ca=12, so \u25a1 can be 3 to 9.\n\nHmm, so without more info, it's ambiguous. But the problem states that there is a unique solution, so perhaps I'm missing a constraint.\n\nWait, maybe considering that each symbol is a digit and all equations must hold, perhaps some of these cases can be eliminated.\n\nWait, in case 1: \u25b3=0, so equation 3: 0 +7 +9=16, which is correct.\n\nIn case 2: \u25b3=1, equation 3:1 +8 +7=16, correct.\n\nIn case 3: \u25b3=2, equation 3:2 +9 +5=16, correct.\n\nSo, all cases are valid. Therefore, perhaps the problem allows multiple solutions, but the question is to find \u25cb\u25a1\u2295, which might be same across all cases? Let's check.\n\nIn case 1: 9 + \u25a1 +7=16 + \u25a1, but without knowing \u25a1, can't determine.\n\nWait, but in case 1, from equation 2: \u25a1 + \u25ca=14, and from equation 1:7 +14=21.\n\nBut maybe I can find what \u25a1 is.\n\nWait, no, because without more info, I can't. So, perhaps the problem has multiple solutions, but the question is to find \u25cb\u25a1\u2295, which might be same in all cases.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nIn case 1: \u25cb=9, so 9 + \u25a1 +7=16 + \u25a1\n\nBut from equation 2: \u25a1 + \u25ca=14, so \u25a1=14 - \u25ca\n\nSo, 9 + (14 - \u25ca) +7=30 - \u25ca\n\nBut from equation 3: \u25b3=0, so 0 +7 +9=16, which is okay.\n\nBut I don't see how that helps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find the value of \u25cb\u25a1\u2295 in terms of known quantities.\n\nWait, let's think differently. Let me add up all three equations.\n\nEquation1: \u2295 + \u25ca + \u25a1 =21\n\nEquation2: \u25a1 + \u25ca + \u25b3 =14\n\nEquation3: \u25b3 + \u2295 + \u25cb =16\n\nIf I add all three equations:\n\n(\u2295 + \u25ca + \u25a1) + (\u25a1 + \u25ca + \u25b3) + (\u25b3 + \u2295 + \u25cb) =21 +14 +16\n\nSimplify left side:\n\n2\u2295 + 2\u25ca + 2\u25a1 + 2\u25b3 + \u25cb =51\n\nSo, 2(\u2295 + \u25ca + \u25a1 + \u25b3) + \u25cb =51\n\nFrom equation1: \u2295 + \u25ca + \u25a1=21\n\nFrom equation2: \u25a1 + \u25ca + \u25b3=14\n\nSo, adding these: (\u2295 + \u25ca + \u25a1) + (\u25a1 + \u25ca + \u25b3)=21 +14=35\n\nWhich is equal to \u2295 + 2\u25ca + 2\u25a1 + \u25b3\n\nSo, from above, 2(\u2295 + \u25ca + \u25a1 + \u25b3) + \u25cb =51\n\nBut from equation1 + equation2: \u2295 + 2\u25ca + 2\u25a1 + \u25b3=35\n\nSo, 2(\u2295 + \u25ca + \u25a1 + \u25b3) + \u25cb =51\n\nBut 2(\u2295 + \u25ca + \u25a1 + \u25b3)=2\u2295 + 2\u25ca + 2\u25a1 + 2\u25b3\n\nWait, maybe another approach.\n\nWait, from equation1 + equation2: 2\u25ca + \u25a1 + \u2295 + \u25b3=35\n\nFrom equation3: \u25b3 + \u2295 + \u25cb=16\n\nSo, let me subtract equation3 from equation1 + equation2:\n\n(2\u25ca + \u25a1 + \u2295 + \u25b3) - (\u25b3 + \u2295 + \u25cb)=35 -16\n\nSimplify:\n\n2\u25ca + \u25a1 - \u25cb=19\n\nSo, 2\u25ca + \u25a1 =19 + \u25cb\n\nHmm, interesting. So, 2\u25ca + \u25a1 =19 + \u25cb\n\nBut from equation2: \u25a1 + \u25ca + \u25b3=14\n\nAnd from equation3: \u25b3 + \u2295 + \u25cb=16\n\nAlso, from equation1: \u2295 + \u25ca + \u25a1=21\n\nWait, maybe I can express \u25ca in terms of other variables.\n\nFrom equation2: \u25a1 + \u25ca=14 - \u25b3\n\nFrom equation1: \u2295 + \u25ca + \u25a1=21 \u2192 (\u2295 + \u25a1) + \u25ca=21\n\nBut from equation2: (\u25a1 + \u25ca)=14 - \u25b3\n\nSo, substituting into equation1: (\u2295 + \u25a1) + (14 - \u25b3 - \u25a1)=21\n\nSimplify: \u2295 +14 - \u25b3=21\n\nSo, \u2295 - \u25b3=7, which is what we had before.\n\nSo, nothing new.\n\nWait, going back to 2\u25ca + \u25a1 =19 + \u25cb\n\nFrom equation2: \u25a1=14 - \u25ca - \u25b3\n\nSo, substituting into 2\u25ca + (14 - \u25ca - \u25b3)=19 + \u25cb\n\nSimplify:\n\n2\u25ca +14 - \u25ca - \u25b3=19 + \u25cb\n\nWhich becomes:\n\n\u25ca - \u25b3=19 + \u25cb -14=5 + \u25cb\n\nSo, \u25ca=\u25b3 +5 + \u25cb\n\nHmm, that's a new equation.\n\nSo, \u25ca=\u25b3 +5 + \u25cb\n\nNow, let's recall from equation3: \u25b3 + \u2295 + \u25cb=16\n\nAnd from earlier, \u2295=\u25b3 +7\n\nSo, substituting into equation3:\n\n\u25b3 + (\u25b3 +7) + \u25cb=16 \u2192 2\u25b3 +7 + \u25cb=16 \u2192 2\u25b3 + \u25cb=9\n\nWhich we had earlier.\n\nSo, from 2\u25b3 + \u25cb=9, we can write \u25cb=9 -2\u25b3\n\nAnd from earlier, \u25ca=\u25b3 +5 + \u25cb=\u25b3 +5 + (9 -2\u25b3)=\u25b3 +5 +9 -2\u25b3=13 -\u25b3\n\nSo, \u25ca=13 -\u25b3\n\nAlso, from equation2: \u25a1 + \u25ca + \u25b3=14\n\nWe have \u25a1=14 - \u25ca - \u25b3=14 - (13 -\u25b3) - \u25b3=14 -13 +\u25b3 -\u25b3=1\n\nSo, \u25a1=1\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, regardless of \u25b3, \u25a1=1.\n\nBecause:\n\n\u25a1=14 - (13 -\u25b3) - \u25b3=14 -13 +\u25b3 -\u25b3=1\n\nSo, \u25a1=1\n\nThat's a breakthrough! So, \u25a1 is always 1.\n\nNow, from equation1: \u2295 + \u25ca + \u25a1=21 \u2192 \u2295 + \u25ca +1=21 \u2192 \u2295 + \u25ca=20\n\nFrom equation2: \u25a1 + \u25ca + \u25b3=14 \u21921 + \u25ca + \u25b3=14 \u2192 \u25ca + \u25b3=13\n\nSo, we have:\n\nFrom equation2: \u25ca + \u25b3=13\n\nFrom earlier: \u2295 + \u25ca=20\n\nAlso, from equation3: \u25b3 + \u2295 + \u25cb=16\n\nAnd from earlier: \u2295=\u25b3 +7\n\nSo, let's substitute \u2295=\u25b3 +7 into equation3:\n\n\u25b3 + (\u25b3 +7) + \u25cb=16 \u21922\u25b3 +7 + \u25cb=16 \u21922\u25b3 + \u25cb=9\n\nWhich gives us \u25cb=9 -2\u25b3\n\nAlso, from equation2: \u25ca=13 -\u25b3\n\nAnd from equation1: \u2295=20 - \u25ca=20 - (13 -\u25b3)=7 +\u25b3\n\nWhich matches our earlier result.\n\nSo, now we have:\n\n- \u25a1=1\n\n- \u2295=\u25b3 +7\n\n- \u25cb=9 -2\u25b3\n\n- \u25ca=13 -\u25b3\n\nNow, since each symbol is a digit (0-9), let's find possible values for \u25b3.\n\nFrom \u2295=\u25b3 +7, since \u2295 must be \u22649, \u25b3 can be 0,1,2.\n\nBecause:\n\n- If \u25b3=0, \u2295=7\n\n- If \u25b3=1, \u2295=8\n\n- If \u25b3=2, \u2295=9\n\nIf \u25b3=3, \u2295=10 which is invalid.\n\nSo, possible \u25b3 values: 0,1,2.\n\nLet's check each case.\n\nCase 1: \u25b3=0\n\nThen:\n\n\u2295=0+7=7\n\n\u25cb=9 -2*0=9\n\n\u25ca=13 -0=13 \u2192 but wait, \u25ca must be a single digit. 13 is invalid.

End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: In a certain symbolic system, the following equations are true:\n\n$\u2295\u25ca\u25a1 = 21$\n$\u25a1\u25ca\u25b3 = 14$\n$\u25b3\u2295\u25cb = 16$\n$\u25cb\u25a1\u2295 = ?$\n\nWhat number does $\u25cb\u25a1\u2295$ equal? Determine the value that each symbol represents. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I've got this problem here with some symbols and equations, and I need to figure out what each symbol stands for and then find the value of \u25cb\u25a1\u2295. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's list out the equations we have:\n\n1. \u2295\u25ca\u25a1 = 21\n2. \u25a1\u25ca\u25b3 = 14\n3. \u25b3\u2295\u25cb = 16\n4. \u25cb\u25a1\u2295 = ? \n\nHmm, okay. So, we have four equations with four symbols: \u2295, \u25ca, \u25a1, and \u25b3. Each equation seems to involve these symbols in different orders, and each equals a number. My goal is to find the numerical values for each symbol so that when I compute \u25cb\u25a1\u2295, I get the missing value, which is the answer.\n\nLet me start by assigning variables to each symbol to make it easier. Let's say:\n\n- Let \u2295 = A\n- Let \u25ca = B\n- Let \u25a1 = C\n- Let \u25b3 = D\n\nSo, rewriting the equations with these variables:\n\n1. A * B * C = 21\n2. C * B * D = 14\n3. D * A * O = 16 (Wait, hold on. The third equation is \u25b3\u2295\u25cb, which is D * A * O. But I don't have a variable for \u25cb. Did I miss that?)\n\nOh, right! There's another symbol: \u25cb. So, I need to include that. Let me correct my variables:\n\n- Let \u2295 = A\n- Let \u25ca = B\n- Let \u25a1 = C\n- Let \u25b3 = D\n- Let \u25cb = E\n\nSo, the equations become:\n\n1. A * B * C = 21\n2. C * B * D = 14\n3. D * A * E = 16\n4. E * C * A = ? \n\nOkay, so now we have five variables: A, B, C, D, E. And we have four equations. That means we might need to find integer values that satisfy all equations. Let's see.\n\nLooking at equations 1 and 2, both involve B, C, and one other variable. Maybe I can find a relationship between A and D using these.\n\nFrom equation 1: A * B * C = 21\n\nFrom equation 2: C * B * D = 14\n\nIf I divide equation 1 by equation 2, I get:\n\n(A * B * C) / (C * B * D) = 21 / 14\n\nSimplifying the left side: A / D\n\nAnd on the right side: 3/2\n\nSo, A / D = 3/2 => A = (3/2) * D\n\nThat's a useful relationship. So, A is 1.5 times D.\n\nNow, looking at equation 3: D * A * E = 16\n\nBut since A = (3/2)D, substitute that into equation 3:\n\nD * (3/2 D) * E = 16\n\nMultiply that out: (3/2) * D^2 * E = 16\n\nLet me write that as (3/2) * D^2 * E = 16 => D^2 * E = (16 * 2) / 3 = 32 / 3 \u2248 10.666...\n\nHmm, that's a fractional value. Since we're dealing with numbers, perhaps the values are integers. So, maybe D^2 * E must be a multiple of 3 to make E an integer. Alternatively, perhaps I made a wrong assumption.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that all symbols represent integers because the results are integers. So, A, B, C, D, E are all positive integers.\n\nGiven that, let's think about equation 1: A * B * C = 21\n\n21 has factors: 1, 3, 7, 21\n\nSo, A, B, C must be factors of 21. Similarly, equation 2: C * B * D = 14\n\n14 has factors: 1, 2, 7, 14\n\nSo, C, B, D must be factors of 14.\n\nLet me list possible values for C, B, D such that C * B * D = 14\n\nPossible triples (C, B, D):\n\n1. (1, 1, 14)\n2. (1, 2, 7)\n3. (1, 7, 2)\n4. (1, 14, 1)\n5. (2, 1, 7)\n6. (2, 7, 1)\n7. (7, 1, 2)\n8. (7, 2, 1)\n9.

(7, 3, 1)\n9.

(1,1)\n2. (1,7)\n3.

So, invalid.\n\nCase 3: (C, B) = (7,1)\n\nFrom equation 1: A * 7 * 1 = 21 => A = 3\n\nFrom equation 2: 7 * 1 * D = 14 => 7D = 14 => D = 2\n\nEquation 3: D * A * E = 2 * 3 * E = 16 => 6E = 16 => E = 16/6 \u2248 2.666...\n\nAgain, not an integer. Hmm, so none of the cases where (C,B) are (1,1), (1,7), (7,1) give integer E.\n\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that C and B are integers. But since the results are integers, and the operations are multiplications, it's reasonable to assume that the symbols represent integers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the operations are not simple multiplication. Wait, the equations are written as \u2295\u25ca\u25a1 = 21, which might be interpreted as \u2295 \u25ca \u25a1 = 21, but without knowing the operation, it's unclear. However, the problem states it's a symbolic system, so it's likely a standard operation like multiplication.\n\nBut let's think differently. Maybe the symbols represent digits or letters, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe they represent operations or have specific meanings. But the problem says \"the following equations are true,\" implying that each equation equates to a number through some operation.\n\nWait, perhaps the symbols represent operations or functions. But without knowing, it's hard to say. Maybe it's better to think of them as variables representing digits or numbers.\n\nWait, let me think again. Since we have four equations with four variables, and we need to find integer solutions, perhaps I can consider that the values are positive integers.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's consider that each equation is a product of three symbols, so each equation is a product of three variables.\n\nGiven that, let's write:\n\nEquation 1: A * B * C = 21\n\nEquation 2: C * B * D = 14\n\nEquation 3: D * A * E = 16\n\nAnd we need to find E * C * A.\n\nSo, let's denote:\n\nFrom equation 1 and 2, we have A/D = 21/14 = 3/2, so A = (3/2) D\n\nFrom equation 3: D * A * E = 16\n\nSubstitute A = (3/2) D:\n\nD * (3/2 D) * E = 16 => (3/2) D^2 * E = 16 => D^2 * E = (16 * 2)/3 = 32/3 \u2248 10.666...\n\nBut D and E must be integers, so D^2 * E must be an integer. Therefore, 32/3 must be an integer, which it's not. So, this suggests that our initial assumption that all symbols are integers might be wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the operations are not multiplication. Maybe it's addition or concatenation. Let me think.\n\nIf the operations are concatenation, like forming two-digit numbers, then:\n\nFor example, \u2295\u25ca\u25a1 could be a three-digit number, but the results are two-digit numbers: 21, 14, 16. Hmm, but 21 is a two-digit number, so maybe it's a two-digit concatenation.\n\nWait, but the equations have three symbols, so if it's concatenation, it would be a three-digit number, but the results are two-digit numbers. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a two-digit number formed by the first two symbols, but that would mean the equations have two symbols, not three. So, perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a combination of operations, like addition and multiplication. But without knowing, it's hard to say.\n\nWait, perhaps the symbols represent digits in some base. For example, in base 10, but maybe in a different base.\n\nBut that seems complicated, and the problem doesn't specify.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the symbols represent letters, and their positions in the alphabet. For example, A=1, B=2, etc. But let's try that.\n\nBut given that the results are 21, 14, 16, which are two-digit numbers, perhaps it's the sum of the positions.\n\nBut let's see:\n\nIf \u2295, \u25ca, \u25a1, \u25b3, \u25cb are letters, let's assign their positions:\n\n\u2295 = some letter, say P\n\n\u25ca = Q\n\n\u25a1 = R\n\n\u25b3 = S\n\n\u25cb = T\n\nThen, the equations would be:\n\nP + Q + R = 21\n\nQ + R + S = 14\n\nS + P + T = 16\n\nAnd we need to find T + R + P.\n\nBut this seems too vague without more information.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the symbols represent digits in a number puzzle.\n\nWait, another approach: Let's consider that each equation is a product of three symbols, so the first equation is A * B * C = 21, second is C * B * D =14, third is D * A * E=16, and we need E * C * A.\n\nSo, from equation 1 and 2, we have A/D = 21/14 = 3/2, so A = (3/2) D\n\nFrom equation 3: D * A * E =16\n\nSubstitute A: D*(3/2 D)*E =16 => (3/2) D\u00b2 E =16 => D\u00b2 E = (16*2)/3=32/3\u224810.666...\n\nBut D must be integer, so D\u00b2 E must be integer. 32/3 is not integer, so perhaps the operations are not multiplication.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the equations are sums.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nIf the equations are sums:\n\n1. \u2295 + \u25ca + \u25a1 =21\n\n2. \u25a1 + \u25ca + \u25b3 =14\n\n3. \u25b3 + \u2295 + \u25cb =16\n\n4. \u25cb + \u25a1 + \u2295 = ?\n\nSo, we have four equations:\n\nA + B + C =21\n\nC + B + D=14\n\nD + A + E=16\n\nAnd we need E + C + A.\n\nLet me write these as:\n\nEquation 1: A + B + C =21\n\nEquation 2: C + B + D=14\n\nEquation 3: D + A + E=16\n\nWe can try to solve this system.\n\nFrom equation 1: A =21 - B - C\n\nFrom equation 2: D=14 - B - C\n\nFrom equation 3: E=16 - D - A =16 - (14 - B - C) - (21 - B - C) =16 -14 + B + C -21 + B + C= (16-14-21)+(B+B)+(C+C)= (-19)+2B +2C=2B +2C -19\n\nSo, E=2B +2C -19\n\nNow, we need to find E + C + A.\n\nLet's express E + C + A in terms of B and C.\n\nE + C + A= (2B +2C -19) + C + (21 - B - C)= 2B +2C -19 + C +21 - B - C= (2B - B) + (2C + C - C) + (-19 +21)= B + 2C +2\n\nSo, E + C + A= B +2C +2\n\nBut we don't know B and C. However, we can try to find possible integer values for B and C.\n\nFrom equation 1: A=21 - B - C >0\n\nFrom equation 2: D=14 - B - C >0\n\nSo, B + C <14 (from equation 2)\n\nBut from equation 1, B + C <21, which is already covered.\n\nSo, B and C are positive integers such that B + C <14.\n\nAlso, from equation 3: E=2B +2C -19 >0 => 2B +2C >19 => B + C >9.5, so B + C \u226510\n\nSo, B + C is between 10 and 13 inclusive.\n\nSo, possible sums for B + C:10,11,12,13\n\nLet me list possible (B, C) pairs for each sum:\n\nSum=10:\n\n(1,9), (2,8), (3,7), (4,6), (5,5), (6,4), (7,3), (8,2), (9,1)\n\nSum=11:\n\n(1,10), (2,9), (3,8), (4,7), (5,6), (6,5), (7,4), (8,3), (9,2), (10,1)\n\nSum=12:\n\n(1,11), (2,10), (3,9), (4,8), (5,7), (6,6), (7,5), (8,4), (9,3), (10,2), (11,1)\n\nSum=13:\n\n(1,12), (2,11), (3,10), (4,9), (5,8), (6,7), (7,6), (8,5), (9,4), (10,3), (11,2), (12,1)\n\nNow, let's check for each possible sum:\n\nFor each sum S=10,11,12,13:\n\nCompute E=2B +2C -19\n\nCompute A=21 - S\n\nCompute D=14 - S\n\nCompute E + C + A= B + 2C +2\n\nBut we need E + C + A to be a specific value, but we don't know it. However, perhaps we can find S such that E is positive and integer.\n\nLet me try S=10:\n\nB + C=10\n\nSo, E=2B +2C -19=2*10 -19=20-19=1\n\nA=21-10=11\n\nD=14-10=4\n\nSo, E=1, A=11, D=4\n\nNow, E + C + A=1 + C +11= C +12\n\nBut we don't know C. However, from S=10, B=10 - C\n\nSo, E + C + A= C +12\n\nBut without knowing C, it's not helpful. However, let's see if this works in equation 3.\n\nWait, equation 3 is D + A + E=4 +"

End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: In a certain symbolic system, the following equations are true:\n\n$\u2295\u25ca\u25a1 = 21$\n$\u25a1\u25ca\u25b3 = 14$\n$\u25b3\u2295\u25cb = 16$\n$\u25cb\u25a1\u2295 = ?$\n\nWhat number does $\u25cb\u25a1\u2295$ equal? Determine the value that each symbol represents. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I've got this problem here with some symbols and equations, and I need to figure out what each symbol stands for and then find the value of \u25cb\u25a1\u2295. Hmm, okay, let me see. The equations given are:\n\n1. \u2295\u25ca\u25a1 = 21\n2. \u25a1\u25ca\u25b3 = 14\n3. \u25b3\u2295\u25cb = 16\n4. \u25cb\u25a1\u2295 = ?\n\nI need to find \u25cb\u25a1\u2295, but to do that, I probably need to figure out what each symbol represents. Since all the equations equal numbers, maybe each symbol corresponds to a single digit or maybe a letter? Hmm, not sure yet. But let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, let's list out the symbols we have: \u2295, \u25ca, \u25a1, \u25b3, \u25cb. So five symbols. And the numbers given are 21, 14, 16, and we need to find the value of \u25cb\u25a1\u2295. The numbers are all two-digit numbers except for 16, which is also two-digit. So maybe each symbol represents a single digit, and when combined, they form two-digit numbers. That makes sense.\n\nSo, if each symbol is a digit, then we can try to assign digits to each symbol such that all the equations hold true. Let's denote:\n\n- \u2295 = A\n- \u25ca = B\n- \u25a1 = C\n- \u25b3 = D\n- \u25cb = E\n\nSo, now, the equations become:\n\n1. AB = 21\n2. BC = 14\n3. DE = 16\n4. CE = ? (We need to find CE)\n\nWait, hold on. Let me make sure I'm assigning the symbols correctly. The first equation is \u2295\u25ca\u25a1, which would be A followed by B followed by C, so ABC? But 21 is a two-digit number. Wait, that doesn't make sense because ABC would be a three-digit number. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the notation.\n\nWait, perhaps the operations are concatenation, but given that the results are two-digit numbers, maybe it's a two-digit operation, so perhaps it's a two-digit number formed by the two symbols. For example, \u2295\u25ca\u25a1 could mean a two-digit number where the first digit is \u2295 and the second digit is \u25ca\u25a1? Hmm, that doesn't quite make sense either.\n\nWait, maybe the symbols represent individual digits, and when two symbols are next to each other, they form a two-digit number. So, for example, in the first equation, \u2295\u25ca\u25a1 = 21, maybe it's a three-digit number where the hundreds digit is \u2295, the tens digit is \u25ca, and the units digit is \u25a1. So, 21 would be 021? But 021 is 21, so that could work. Similarly, the second equation, \u25a1\u25ca\u25b3 = 14, would be a three-digit number, 014, which is 14. The third equation, \u25b3\u2295\u25cb = 16, would be 016, which is 16. So, if that's the case, then each equation is a three-digit number equaling a two-digit number, which would mean the leading symbol is zero.\n\nBut that seems a bit odd because typically, in such problems, leading zeros are not considered. So maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the symbols represent digits, and when two symbols are next to each other, they form a two-digit number. So, for example, in the first equation, \u2295\u25ca\u25a1 = 21, maybe it's a two-digit number where the first digit is \u2295 and the second digit is \u25ca\u25a1. But that doesn't make much sense because \u25ca\u25a1 is two symbols, which would make it a three-digit number. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait, maybe the symbols are operators or something else. But the problem says it's a symbolic system, so perhaps they are digits. Let me try to think differently.\n\nLet me consider that each equation is a two-digit number formed by two symbols. For example, \u2295\u25ca\u25a1 = 21 could mean a two-digit number where the first symbol is \u2295 and the second is \u25ca\u25a1, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe it's a two-digit number where the first digit is the result of \u2295 and the second digit is the result of \u25ca\u25a1, but that would require more information.\n\nWait, maybe the symbols represent the digits of the number, so for example, in the first equation, \u2295\u25ca\u25a1 = 21, which is a three-digit number: the first digit is \u2295, the second is \u25ca, and the third is \u25a1. So, 21 would be 021, meaning \u2295=0, \u25ca=2, \u25a1=1. Then, in the second equation, \u25a1\u25ca\u25b3 =14, which would be 1 2 \u25b3 = 014, so \u25b3=4. Then, the third equation, \u25b3\u2295\u25cb =16, which would be 4 0 \u25cb = 016, so \u25cb=6. Then, the fourth equation, \u25cb\u25a1\u2295 = ?, which would be 6 1 0 = 610. But wait, 610 is a three-digit number, but the result is just a number, so maybe it's 610, but that seems too big. Alternatively, maybe it's a two-digit number, but that wouldn't make sense because there are three symbols.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the symbols represent individual digits, and the equations are operations. For example, \u2295\u25ca\u25a1 could be (\u2295 + \u25ca) \u00d7 \u25a1 =21, but that's just a guess. But without knowing the operations, it's hard to say.\n\nWait, the problem says it's a symbolic system, so perhaps it's a form of arithmetic with these symbols representing digits. So, maybe each symbol is a digit, and when you concatenate them, they form numbers. So, for example, in the first equation, \u2295\u25ca\u25a1 =21, meaning the number formed by \u2295, \u25ca, and \u25a1 is 21. But 21 is a two-digit number, so that would mean that the number is 21, so the three symbols must form 21, which is two digits, so one of them must be zero. So, maybe \u2295 is 0, and \u25ca is 2, and \u25a1 is 1. Then, the second equation, \u25a1\u25ca\u25b3 =14, so \u25a1 is 1, \u25ca is 2, so the number formed is 12\u25b3 =14. So, 12\u25b3=14, meaning \u25b3 is 4. Then, the third equation, \u25b3\u2295\u25cb =16, so \u25b3 is 4, \u2295 is 0, so 40\u25cb=16. So, 40\u25cb=16, which would mean that \u25cb is 16/40=0.4, which is not a whole number. That doesn't make sense because symbols should represent digits, which are whole numbers from 0-9.\n\nHmm, that's a problem. So maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Let me try a different approach.\n\nPerhaps each equation is a two-digit number where the first digit is one symbol and the second digit is the combination of the other two. For example, in the first equation, \u2295 is the first digit, and the second digit is \u25ca\u25a1, which is a two-digit number. So, \u2295 is a single digit, and \u25ca\u25a1 is another two-digit number, making the total a three-digit number. But that seems too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the symbols are operators or have specific meanings. For example, \u2295 could be addition, \u25ca multiplication, etc. But the problem says it's a symbolic system, so perhaps each symbol represents a digit.\n\nWait, maybe the equations are in a different base. For example, if we consider that these are numbers in base 10, but perhaps the operations are in a different base. Let me try that.\n\nIf I consider the first equation, \u2295\u25ca\u25a1 =21. Let's assume that it's a two-digit number where \u2295 is the first digit and \u25ca\u25a1 is the second digit, but that doesn't make sense because \u25ca\u25a1 is two symbols. Alternatively, maybe it's a three-digit number where the first digit is \u2295, the second is \u25ca, and the third is \u25a1. So, 21 would be 021, meaning \u2295=0, \u25ca=2, \u25a1=1.\n\nThen, the second equation, \u25a1\u25ca\u25b3=14, which would be 1 2 \u25b3=014, so \u25b3=4.\n\nThird equation, \u25b3\u2295\u25cb=16, which would be 4 0 \u25cb=016, so \u25cb=6.\n\nThen, the fourth equation, \u25cb\u25a1\u2295= ?, which would be 6 1 0=610.\n\nBut 610 is a three-digit number, and the question is asking for \u25cb\u25a1\u2295, which is a three-digit number. But the previous results are 21, 14, and 16, which are two-digit numbers. So, maybe the result should also be a two-digit number. Therefore, perhaps my assumption is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the equations are in a different base. Let's suppose that these numbers are in base 8 or base 9.\n\nFor example, 21 in base 10 is 27 in base 8 (because 2*8 +7=23). Wait, no, that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe the symbols represent letters, and the numbers are in a different base.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the symbols represent the digits, but the operations are addition or multiplication. For example, \u2295 could be addition, and \u25ca multiplication, etc. But that's speculative.\n\nWait, let's try to think of it as each equation being a two-digit number where the first digit is one symbol and the second digit is the combination of two symbols. For example, \u2295\u25ca\u25a1 =21 could mean that the first digit is \u2295, and the second digit is \u25ca\u25a1, which would be a two-digit number. But that seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the symbols represent single digits, and when combined, they form two-digit numbers. So, for example, in the first equation, \u2295\u25ca\u25a1 =21, which could be a three-digit number: A B C =21, but 21 is two digits, so perhaps the hundreds digit is 0, making it 0AB=21, but that would mean A=2, B=1. But then the second equation, \u25a1\u25ca\u25b3=14, which would be C B D=14. If C=1, B=1, then D=4. Then, the third equation, \u25b3\u2295\u25cb=16, which is D A E=16. So D=4, A=2, so 4 2 E=16. Therefore, 42E=16. But 42E is a three-digit number, and 16 is two digits, so that doesn't make sense unless we're considering modulo 100 or something. Alternatively, maybe it's a two-digit number where the first digit is D and the second is A followed by E, but that's unclear.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should try assigning variables and see if I can solve the system.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s assign:\n\n- \u2295 = A\n- \u25ca = B\n- \u25a1 = C\n- \u25b3 = D\n- \u25cb = E\n\nNow, the equations are:\n\n1. A B C =21 (as a three-digit number)\n2. C B D =14\n3. D A E =16\n4. E C A = ?\n\nBut wait, the first equation is A B C =21, so A=0, B=2, C=1, because 021=21.\n\nThen, the second equation is C B D =14, so C=1, B=2, so 1 2 D=14, so D=4.\n\nThird equation is D A E=16, so D=4, A=0, so 4 0 E=16, so E=6.\n\nThen, the fourth equation is E C A =6 1 0=610, but the question is to find E C A, which is 610. However, the previous results were 21,14,16, which are two-digit numbers, so 610 seems too big. Also, in the third equation, 4 0 E=16, which is 40E=16, so E=16/40=0.4, which is not a whole number, so that can't be right.\n\nSo, this approach leads to a contradiction because E would have to be 0.4, which isn't a digit. Therefore, my initial assumption that the first equation is a three-digit number equal to 21 must be wrong.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe each equation is a two-digit number where the first digit is one symbol and the second digit is the combination of the other two. For example, \u2295\u25ca\u25a1 =21 could mean that the first digit is \u2295, and the second digit is \u25ca\u25a1, which would be a two-digit number. So, \u2295 is a single digit, and \u25ca\u25a1 is a two-digit number, making the total a three-digit number. But that seems too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the symbols are digits, and the equations are in a different base. Let's try base 9.\n\nIn base 9, 21 would be 2*9 +1=19 in base10, but that doesn't help. Alternatively, maybe base 8: 21 in base10 is 27 in base8 (2*8+7=23, which isn't 21). Hmm, not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe the symbols represent letters, and the numbers are in a different base. For example, A=10, B=11, etc. But that's speculative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the symbols represent digits, and the equations are in a different base. Let's try base 10, but the symbols represent digits.\n\nWait, maybe the first equation is a two-digit number: \u2295 and \u25ca\u25a1, but that doesn't make sense because \u25ca\u25a1 is two symbols.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the symbols represent digits, and the equations are:\n\n1. \u2295 + \u25ca = \u25a1, but that doesn't fit 21.\n\nWait, no, the equations are equal to numbers, so likely concatenation.\n\nWait, perhaps the first equation is a two-digit number where the first digit is \u2295 and the second digit is \u25ca, so \u2295\u25ca=21. Similarly, the second equation is \u25a1\u25ca\u25b3=14, which would be a three-digit number, but that's confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each equation is a two-digit number where the first two symbols form the number. So, in the first equation, \u2295 and \u25ca form 21, so \u2295=2, \u25ca=1. Then, the second equation, \u25a1 and \u25ca form 14, so \u25a1=1, \u25ca=4. But that contradicts the first equation where \u25ca=1. So that doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first two symbols form the number, so \u2295\u25ca=21, meaning \u2295=2, \u25ca=1. Then, the second equation, \u25a1\u25ca\u25b3=14, so \u25a1=1, \u25ca=4, but that contradicts the first equation where \u25ca=1. So, that doesn't work.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I need to consider that each equation is a two-digit number where the first symbol is one digit and the second symbol is another digit, but the equations involve three symbols. So, for example, in the first equation, \u2295\u25ca\u25a1=21, which could mean that the first digit is \u2295, and the second digit is \u25ca\u25a1, which is a two-digit number. But that would make the total a three-digit number, which is 21, which is two digits. So, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the symbols are operators. For example, \u2295 could be addition, \u25ca multiplication, \u25a1 division, etc. But without knowing the operations, it's hard to solve.\n\nWait, maybe the symbols represent digits, and the equations are in a different base. Let's assume that the numbers are in base 9.\n\nSo, 21 in base10 is 2*9 +1=19 in base9, but that doesn't help. Alternatively, 21 in base10 is 21 in base9, which is 2*9 +1=19. Hmm, not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are in base 10, but the symbols represent letters. For example, A=1, B=2, etc. But that seems unlikely.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let's try to think of the symbols as digits and the equations as concatenations, meaning that each equation is a three-digit number.\n\nSo, first equation: \u2295\u25ca\u25a1=21, which is 100\u2295 +10\u25ca + \u25a1=21.\n\nSimilarly, second equation: \u25a1\u25ca\u25b3=14 \u2192 100\u25a1 +10\u25ca +\u25b3=14.\n\nThird equation: \u25b3\u2295\u25cb=16 \u2192100\u25b3 +10\u2295 +\u25cb=16.\n\nWe need to find \u25cb\u25a1\u2295, which would be 100\u25cb +10\u25a1 +\u2295.\n\nSo, we have:\n\n1. 100A +10B + C =21 \u2192 A=0, 10B + C=21.\n\nSince A=0, 10B + C=21. So B=2, C=1 because 10*2 +1=21.\n\nSo, A=0, B=2, C=1.\n\nSecond equation: 100C +10B + D=14 \u2192 100*1 +10*2 + D=14 \u2192 100 +20 +D=14 \u2192 120 +D=14 \u2192 D=14-120=-106. That's impossible because D must be a digit between 0-9. So, this approach is invalid.\n\nTherefore, my assumption that the equations are three-digit numbers is wrong.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the equations are two-digit numbers where the first digit is one symbol and the second digit is the combination of the other two. For example, \u2295\u25ca\u25a1=21 could mean that the first digit is \u2295, and the second digit is \u25ca\u25a1, which is a two-digit number. So, \u2295 is a single digit, and \u25ca\u25a1 is a two-digit number, making the total a three-digit number. But that doesn't make sense because 21 is two digits.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the symbols are digits, and the equations are in a different base. Let's try base 10 again but with different logic.\n\nWait, maybe the first equation is a two-digit number where the first digit is \u2295 and the second digit is \u25ca\u25a1, but that would require three symbols to form a two-digit number, which isn't possible. So, perhaps the symbols represent digits, and the equations are in a different base.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the symbols are letters representing digits, like A=1, B=2, etc"

Determine the value that each symbol represents. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I've got this problem here with some symbols and equations, and I need to figure out what each symbol stands for and then find the value of \u25cb\u25a1\u2295. Let me see. Okay, the equations are:\n\n1. \u2295\u25ca\u25a1 = 21\n2. \u25a1\u25ca\u25b3 = 14\n3. \u25b3\u2295\u25cb = 16\n4. \u25cb\u25a1\u2295 = ?\n\nHmm, symbols. They look like some kind of operations or maybe letters. Since they're all different, I guess each one is unique. So, I need to find the values of each symbol such that all these equations are satisfied.\n\nLet me list them again for clarity:\n\n1. \u2295 \u25ca \u25a1 = 21\n2. \u25a1 \u25ca \u25b3 = 14\n3. \u25b3 \u2295 \u25cb = 16\n4. \u25cb \u25a1 \u2295 = ?\n\nI think each equation is an operation involving three symbols, and the result is a number. So, maybe these symbols represent operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, or exponents? Or maybe they're something else entirely.\n\nWait, let's think about it. If I consider each symbol as a binary operation, maybe like a function that takes two inputs and gives an output. But the equations are written with three symbols, so maybe it's a ternary operation? Or perhaps it's just concatenation? Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each symbol represents a single digit, and the operations are additions or multiplications? But that might not make sense with three symbols each time. Or maybe each symbol is a number itself, and the operations are concatenations or something.\n\nWait, let's try to think of the simplest way. Maybe each symbol is a single digit, and when you see three symbols together, you perform an operation on them. But what operations? Let's see.\n\nLooking at the first equation: \u2295 \u25ca \u25a1 = 21. If I assume that these symbols are operations, perhaps addition or multiplication. Let me test that.\n\nIf \u2295 is addition, \u25ca is multiplication, and \u25a1 is something else. But then, how would that work? Let me see:\n\nSuppose \u2295 is addition, so the first equation would be addition of \u25ca and \u25a1 equals 21. But then, I don't know what \u25ca and \u25a1 are. Alternatively, if \u2295 is multiplication, then multiplication of \u25ca and \u25a1 is 21. Hmm, but then the second equation would be \u25a1 multiplied by \u25b3 equals 14.\n\nWait, maybe all these symbols are numbers, and the operations are concatenations. Let me try that. So, for example, if \u2295 is 2, \u25ca is 3, and \u25a1 is 1, then 2 concatenated with 3 and 1 is 231, but that's way bigger than 21. So, maybe they're single digits, and when you concatenate three digits, you get a three-digit number. So, 21 is a two-digit number. Hmm, that might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the symbols are operators, and the numbers are results of applying those operators to the digits. For example, if \u2295 is addition, \u25ca is multiplication, and \u25a1 is subtraction. Then, \u2295 \u25ca \u25a1 could mean add (multiply (subtract something)). But this seems too vague.\n\nWait, perhaps the symbols are exponents. Like, \u2295 is 2, \u25ca is 3, and \u25a1 is 4. Then, 2^3^4 is 2^(3^4) = 2^81, which is way too big. So, that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they are roots or logarithms. For example, square root, cube root, etc. But again, not sure.\n\nWait, maybe it's simpler. Maybe each symbol is a number, and when you see three symbols together, you perform an operation like addition, multiplication, or concatenation. For example, if \u2295 is 2, \u25ca is 3, and \u25a1 is 1, then 2 + 3 * 1 = 5, which is not 21. Or 2 * 3 + 1 = 7, not 21. Or maybe 2^3 + 1 = 9, nope.\n\nWait, perhaps the operations are concatenation. So, for example, if \u2295 is 2, \u25ca is 3, and \u25a1 is 1, then concatenating them would be 231, but that's 231, not 21. So, maybe they're single digits, and the operations are something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the symbols represent operations in a different order, like first multiply, then add, or something. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe each symbol is a number, and the operations are addition and multiplication in some combination. For example, in the first equation: \u2295 \u25ca \u25a1 = 21. Suppose \u2295 is addition, \u25ca is multiplication, and \u25a1 is a number. Then, it would be add (multiply (something)). But I don't know.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a two-step operation. Like, first multiply, then add, or vice versa. For example, if \u2295 is addition and \u25ca is multiplication, then it could be (\u25ca \u25a1) + \u2295 = 21. But I don't know what \u25a1 is.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to assign variables to each symbol and set up equations. Let's try that.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet a = \u2295, b = \u25ca, c = \u25a1, d = \u25b3, e = \u25cb.\n\nThen, the equations become:\n\n1. a \u25ca b c = 21\n2. b c d = 14\n3. d a e = 16\n4. e c a = ?\n\nBut I don't know what operations \u25ca, \u25a1, \u25b3, \u25cb represent. Maybe they are binary operations, but then I have three variables each time. Hmm, this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each symbol is a single digit, and the operations are concatenation. For example, if a=2, b=3, c=1, then a b c = 231, which is too big. But 21 is two digits. Maybe it's a two-digit number.\n\nWait, if I have three symbols, and the result is two digits, maybe the first two symbols are concatenated, and then the third is added or multiplied. For example, a b c could be (a concatenated with b) + c or (a concatenated with b) * c.\n\nLet me try that. Suppose a b c = (a concatenated with b) + c = 21.\n\nSo, if a and b are single digits, then a concatenated with b is 10a + b. Then, 10a + b + c = 21.\n\nSimilarly, b c d = (10b + c) + d =14.\n\nAnd d a e = (10d + a) + e =16.\n\nThen, we can write these as:\n\n1. 10a + b + c =21\n2. 10b + c + d =14\n3. 10d + a + e =16\n\nAnd we need to find e c a, which would be (10e + c) + a.\n\nBut now, we have four equations with five variables. Hmm, maybe we can find relations between them.\n\nLet me see. From equation 1: 10a + b + c =21. Since a, b, c are digits, they must be integers between 0 and 9.\n\nSimilarly, equation 2: 10b + c + d =14. So, 10b + c is at most 99, but since d is a digit, 10b + c + d =14, so 10b + c is at most 14. So, b can be 0 or 1.\n\nIf b=0, then 10*0 + c + d =14 \u2192 c + d=14.\n\nIf b=1, then 10*1 + c + d=14 \u2192 10 + c + d=14 \u2192 c + d=4.\n\nSimilarly, from equation 1: if b=0, then 10a + 0 + c=21 \u2192 10a + c=21.\n\nIf b=1, then 10a +1 + c=21 \u219210a + c=20.\n\nLet me consider both cases.\n\nCase 1: b=0.\n\nThen, from equation 1: 10a + c=21.\n\nFrom equation 2: c + d=14.\n\nFrom equation 3: 10d + a + e=16.\n\nWe need to find a, c, d, e.\n\nFrom equation 1: 10a + c=21.\n\nPossible a and c:\n\na can be 2, since 10*2=20, so c=1.\n\na=2, c=1.\n\nThen, from equation 2: c + d=14 \u21921 + d=14 \u2192d=13.\n\nBut d must be a single digit (0-9), so d=13 is invalid.\n\nThus, b=0 is not possible.\n\nCase 2: b=1.\n\nFrom equation 1: 10a +1 + c=21 \u219210a + c=20.\n\nPossible a and c:\n\na can be 2, since 10*2=20, c=0.\n\na=2, c=0.\n\nFrom equation 2: c + d=4 \u21920 + d=4 \u2192d=4.\n\nFrom equation 3: 10d + a + e=16 \u219210*4 +2 + e=16 \u219240 +2 + e=16 \u219242 + e=16 \u2192e=16-42=-26.\n\nBut e must be a digit (0-9), so e=-26 is invalid. So, this is impossible.\n\nWait, that didn't work. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let's check equation 1 again with b=1.\n\n10a +1 +c=21 \u219210a +c=20.\n\nPossible a and c:\n\na=1: 10*1 +c=20 \u2192c=10. Not possible.\n\na=2: 10*2 +c=20 \u2192c=0. So, a=2, c=0.\n\nThen, equation 2: c + d=4 \u21920 + d=4 \u2192d=4.\n\nEquation 3: 10d + a + e=16 \u219210*4 +2 + e=16 \u219240 +2 +e=16 \u219242 +e=16 \u2192e= -26. Still invalid.\n\nHmm, so maybe the operations are different. Maybe it's multiplication and addition.\n\nWait, maybe the operations are concatenation and multiplication. Let me try that.\n\nSuppose a b c = (a concatenated with b) * c =21.\n\nSimilarly, b c d = (b concatenated with c)*d=14.\n\nAnd d a e = (d concatenated with a)*e=16.\n\nThen, we can write:\n\n1. (10a + b) * c =21\n2. (10b + c) * d =14\n3. (10d + a) * e =16\n\nAnd find e c a = ?\n\nNow, since 21,14,16 are products, and (10a +b) * c=21.\n\n21 can be factored as 1*21, 3*7.\n\nSimilarly, 14=1*14,2*7.\n\n16=1*16,2*8,4*4.\n\nSo, let's consider possible values.\n\nFrom equation1: (10a +b)*c=21.\n\nPossible (10a +b) and c:\n\nEither (1,21), (3,7), (7,3), (21,1). But since a and b are digits, 10a +b can be at most 99, but in this case, it's 21. So possible 10a +b=3, c=7 or 10a +b=7, c=3 or 10a +b=21, c=1.\n\nSimilarly, 10a +b must be a factor of 21.\n\nSo, possible 10a +b=3,7,21.\n\nBut 10a +b is a two-digit number, so 10a +b=21 is possible only if a=2, b=1.\n\nBecause 21 is 2 and 1.\n\nSo, let's see.\n\nCase 1: 10a +b=21, c=1.\n\nThen, a=2, b=1, c=1.\n\nFrom equation2: (10b +c)*d=14.\n\nSo, b=1, c=1, so 10*1 +1=11.\n\nSo, 11*d=14 \u2192d=14/11, which is not an integer. So, invalid.\n\nCase 2: 10a +b=7, c=3.\n\nSo, 10a +b=7. Possible a=0, b=7; a=1, b=-2 (invalid). So, a=0, b=7.\n\nThen, c=3.\n\nFrom equation2: (10b +c)*d=14.\n\nb=7, c=3, so 10*7 +3=73.\n\n73*d=14 \u2192d=14/73, not integer.\n\nInvalid.\n\nCase3: 10a +b=3, c=7.\n\n10a +b=3.\n\nPossible a=0, b=3.\n\nThen, c=7.\n\nFrom equation2: (10b +c)*d=14.\n\nb=3, c=7, so 10*3 +7=37.\n\n37*d=14 \u2192d=14/37, not integer.\n\nInvalid.\n\nSo, none of these cases work. Maybe the operations are different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the operations are concatenation and addition. So, a b c = (a concatenated with b) + c=21.\n\nSimilarly, b c d = (b concatenated with c) + d=14.\n\nAnd d a e = (d concatenated with a) + e=16.\n\nThen, let's write the equations:\n\n1. (10a + b) + c =21\n2. (10b + c) + d =14\n3. (10d + a) + e =16\n\nAnd find e c a = ?\n\nNow, with a, b, c, d, e as digits (0-9).\n\nFrom equation1: 10a + b + c=21.\n\nPossible a and c:\n\nSince 10a + b + c=21, and a, b, c are digits, a can be 0,1,2.\n\nIf a=2, then 20 + b + c=21 \u2192b + c=1. Since b and c are digits, possible b=0, c=1 or b=1, c=0.\n\nIf a=1, 10 + b + c=21 \u2192b + c=11. Since b and c are digits, possible b=2, c=9; b=3, c=8; b=4, c=7; b=5, c=6; b=6, c=5; b=7, c=4; b=8, c=3; b=9, c=2.\n\nIf a=0, 0 + b + c=21 \u2192b + c=21. But since b and c are digits (max 9+9=18), this is impossible.\n\nSo, possible a=2, b +c=1.\n\nOr a=1, b +c=11.\n\nLet me try a=2, b +c=1.\n\nPossible b=0, c=1 or b=1, c=0.\n\nCase1: a=2, b=0, c=1.\n\nFrom equation2: (10b + c) + d =14.\n\nb=0, c=1, so 10*0 +1 +d=14 \u21921 +d=14 \u2192d=13. Invalid.\n\nCase2: a=2, b=1, c=0.\n\nFrom equation2: (10b +c) +d=14.\n\nb=1, c=0, so 10*1 +0 +d=14 \u219210 +d=14 \u2192d=4.\n\nNow, from equation3: (10d +a) +e=16.\n\nd=4, a=2, so 10*4 +2 +e=16 \u219240 +2 +e=16 \u219242 +e=16 \u2192e= -26.

Let me try to break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, let me list out the equations given:\n\n1. \u2295\u25ca\u25a1 = 21\n2. \u25a1\u25ca\u25b3 = 14\n3. \u25b3\u2295\u25cb = 16\n4. \u25cb\u25a1\u2295 = ?

Each of these probably represents a unique digit since the results are numbers like 21, 14, 16, and the final one is a single-digit or two-digit number.

A B C = 21\n2. C B D = 14\n3. D A E = 16\n4. E C A = ? \n\nWait, hold on. The first equation is A B C = 21. But if A, B, C are digits, then A B C would represent a three-digit number. Similarly, C B D is a three-digit number equal to 14. Hmm, 14 is a two-digit number, so maybe I'm misunderstanding the notation.\n\nWait, maybe the operations are not concatenation but addition or multiplication? The problem says it's a symbolic system, so it could be either. But the equations are written with symbols next to each other, which might imply concatenation. For example, \u2295\u25ca\u25a1 could mean the concatenation of \u2295, \u25ca, and \u25a1, forming a number.\n\nBut if that's the case, then the first equation is a three-digit number, 21, which is a two-digit number. That doesn't make sense. So perhaps they are operations, like addition or multiplication.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a two-digit number where the first two symbols are the first two digits, and the third is separate? Wait, that might complicate things.\n\nWait, let me think again. Maybe each equation is an operation involving two symbols, not three. For example, \u2295\u25ca\u25a1 could mean \u2295 (\u25ca \u25a1), which would be an operation with two operands, \u25ca and \u25a1, and then \u2295 is an operator. But then the results are single numbers, like 21, which is a two-digit number. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the symbols represent digits, and the equations are showing the sum or product of two digits. For example, \u2295 + \u25ca + \u25a1 = 21, but then that would be three digits adding up to 21, which is possible. Similarly, \u25a1 + \u25ca + \u25b3 = 14, and \u25b3 + \u2295 + \u25cb = 16. Then, finally, \u25cb + \u25a1 + \u2295 = ?. \n\nBut the problem is that each equation has three symbols, which might represent either addition or concatenation. If it's addition, then it's easier because I can set up equations to solve for each variable. If it's concatenation, then I can form numbers.\n\nWait, let's assume concatenation because the results are 21, 14, and 16, which are two-digit numbers. So maybe each equation is the concatenation of two symbols, forming a two-digit number. But then the first equation is \u2295\u25ca\u25a1 = 21, which would imply that it's a three-symbol concatenation, but 21 is a two-digit number. Hmm, that's conflicting.\n\nWait, maybe the equations are using two symbols each, but the way it's written is with three symbols. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nThe original problem is written as:\n\n$\u2295\u25ca\u25a1 = 21$\n\n$\u25a1\u25ca\u25b3 = 14$\n\n$\u25b3\u2295\u25cb = 16$\n\n$\u25cb\u25a1\u2295 = ?$\n\nSo each equation has three symbols. Maybe each equation is the concatenation of three symbols, but the results are two-digit numbers. That doesn't quite add up because three symbols would make a three-digit number, but the results are two-digit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each equation is an operation involving two symbols, and the third is the result. But the notation is unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps the equations are using symbols as digits in a number. For example, \u2295\u25ca\u25a1 could be a two-digit number where the first digit is the result of an operation between \u2295 and \u25ca, and the second digit is \u25a1. But that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a three-digit number where each symbol is a digit, so \u2295\u25ca\u25a1 is 21, meaning it's a three-digit number where the first digit is \u2295, the second is \u25ca, and the third is \u25a1, making 21. But 21 is a two-digit number, so that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Maybe I need to think differently. Let's assume that each equation is the sum of two symbols, and the third is the result. For example, \u2295 + \u25ca + \u25a1 = 21. Similarly, \u25a1 + \u25ca + \u25b3 = 14, and \u25b3 + \u2295 + \u25cb = 16. Then, \u25cb + \u25a1 + \u2295 = ? \n\nIf that's the case, then I can set up equations:\n\n1. A + B + C = 21\n2. C + B + D = 14\n3. D + A + E = 16\n4. E + C + A = ?\n\nBut wait, that might not be consistent. Let me try another approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the equations are the product of two symbols. For example, \u2295 \u00d7 \u25ca \u00d7 \u25a1 = 21. But 21 factors into 3\u00d77, so maybe \u2295, \u25ca, \u25a1 are 1, 3, 7 or 1, 1, 21, but 21 is too big for a single digit. So maybe 1, 3, 7. But that would mean three symbols, each being 1, 3, or 7. Then, let's check the second equation: \u25a1\u00d7\u25ca\u00d7\u25b3=14. 14 factors into 2\u00d77. So maybe \u25a1, \u25ca, \u25b3 are 1, 2, 7. But from the first equation, we had 1,3,7. So overlapping only in 7. Then, third equation: \u25b3\u2295\u25cb=16. So \u25b3, \u2295, \u25cb would have to multiply to 16. 16 factors into 2\u00d72\u00d74 or 1\u00d72\u00d78, etc. But from previous, \u25b3 is 7 from the second equation, so 7\u00d7\u2295\u00d7\u25cb=16. But 16 divided by 7 is not an integer, so that doesn't work. So maybe the operations are not multiplication.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's addition. Let's try that.\n\nIf \u2295 + \u25ca + \u25a1 = 21, then possible digits adding up to 21. Since each digit is at most 9, the maximum sum is 9+9+9=27, so 21 is possible.\n\nSimilarly, \u25a1 + \u25ca + \u25b3 =14, and \u25b3 + \u2295 + \u25cb=16.\n\nBut we have four variables: A, B, C, D, E. Wait, no, wait: symbols are \u2295, \u25ca, \u25a1, \u25b3, \u25cb. So five symbols. Wait, no, in the equations, we have:\n\n1. A B C =21 (assuming concatenation)\n2. C B D=14\n3. D A E=16\n4. E C A=?\n\nWait, if it's concatenation, then each equation is a three-digit number. So:\n\n1. ABC =21 \u2192 but 21 is a two-digit number, so this can't be. Therefore, concatenation doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the equations are using two symbols each, with the third being the result. But the notation is unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps the equations are using two symbols and an operator, but the way it's written is three symbols. For example, \u2295\u25ca\u25a1 could mean (\u2295 \u25ca) \u25a1, which would be an operation between \u2295 and \u25ca, then combined with \u25a1. But it's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each equation is the sum of two symbols, and the third is the result. For example:\n\n\u2295 + \u25ca = \u25a1, and that equals 21? But that would be a single equation, not three.\n\nWait, perhaps the equations are using two symbols each, but written with three symbols because of the way they're placed. For example, \u2295\u25ca\u25a1 could mean \u2295 \u25ca \u25a1, which is three separate symbols, each being a digit, and the equation is their sum or product.\n\nGiven that, let me try to assign each symbol as a digit and see if I can find values that satisfy all equations.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n\u2295 = A\n\n\u25ca = B\n\n\u25a1 = C\n\n\u25b3 = D\n\n\u25cb = E\n\nSo, the equations become:\n\n1. A B C = 21 (assuming concatenation, but 21 is two digits, so maybe A B =21, but then where does C come in?)\n\nWait, this is confusing. Maybe the equations are the sum of two symbols, and the third is the result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each equation is a two-digit number where the first two symbols are the digits, and the third is the result. But that might not make sense.\n\nWait, another approach: perhaps the equations are in the form of a function where the first two symbols are inputs, and the third is the output. But without knowing the function, it's hard to say.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the equations are using symbols as digits in a number, with the third symbol being a separate digit. For example, \u2295\u25ca\u25a1 could be a three-digit number where the first two digits are \u2295 and \u25ca, and the third is \u25a1, but that would make it a three-digit number, but the result is 21, which is two digits.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe I need to think of the symbols as digits and the equations as sums or products.\n\nLet me try the sum approach again.\n\nAssume that each equation is the sum of three symbols:\n\n1. A + B + C = 21\n2. C + B + D = 14\n3. D + A + E = 16\n4. E + C + A = ?\n\nBut with five variables, this might not be solvable because we have only three equations. Unless there's a relationship between them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the equations are the product of two symbols:\n\n1. A \u00d7 B \u00d7 C =21\n2. C \u00d7 B \u00d7 D =14\n3. D \u00d7 A \u00d7 E =16\n\nBut again, with five variables, it's difficult.\n\nWait, maybe the equations are using two symbols each, with the third being the result. For example:\n\n1. A + B = C =21\n2. C + B = D =14\n3. D + A = E =16\n4. E + C = ? \n\nBut that would make sense. Let me try that.\n\nSo, if:\n\n1. A + B = C =21 \u2192 C=21, but C is a digit, which can't be 21. So that doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe:\n\n1. A \u00d7 B = C =21 \u2192 So C=21, which is not a digit. Not possible.\n\nHmm, maybe the equations are using two symbols to form a two-digit number, with the third being a separate digit. For example:\n\n1. AB =21, where A=\u2295, B=\u25ca, and C=\u25a1\n2. CD=14, where C=\u25a1, B=\u25ca, D=\u25b3\n3. DE=16, where D=\u25b3, A=\u2295, E=\u25cb\n4. EC= ? \n\nWait, let's try that. So:\n\nEquation 1: AB=21 \u2192 A=2, B=1 (since 2 and 1 are digits)\n\nEquation 2: CD=14 \u2192 C=1, D=4 (since 1 and 4 are digits)\n\nBut from equation 1, B=1, so in equation 2, C=1 (same as B). Is that allowed? Maybe, but let's check.\n\nEquation 3: DE=16 \u2192 D=4, E=6 (since 4\u00d76=24, which is not 16. Wait, 16 can be 8\u00d72, 4\u00d74, 16\u00d71, but E and D are digits, so possible:\n\nIf D=4, then E=4 (because 4\u00d74=16). So E=4.\n\nBut from equation 3, D=4, A=2, E=4. So E=4.\n\nThen equation 4: EC= ? \u2192 E=4, C=1 \u2192 4 and 1, so EC=41.\n\nBut let's check if this fits all equations.\n\nFrom equation 1: AB=21 \u2192 A=2, B=1\n\nEquation 2: CD=14 \u2192 C=1, D=4\n\nEquation 3: DE=16 \u2192 D=4, E=4 (since 4\u00d74=16)\n\nEquation 4: EC=41\n\nBut let's check if this makes sense.\n\nBut wait, in equation 2, CD=14, so C=1, D=4\n\nIn equation 3, DE=16, so D=4, E=4\n\nBut in equation 1, B=1, which is the same as C=1. Is that allowed? Maybe, but let's see if it works.\n\nSo, symbols:\n\n\u2295=A=2\n\n\u25ca=B=1\n\n\u25a1=C=1\n\n\u25b3=D=4\n\n\u25cb=E=4\n\nThen, check equation 1: AB=21 \u2192 2 and 1 \u2192 21. Correct.\n\nEquation 2: CD=14 \u2192 1 and 4 \u2192 14. Correct.\n\nEquation 3: DE=16 \u2192 4 and 4 \u2192 16. Correct.\n\nEquation 4: EC=41 \u2192 4 and 1 \u2192 41. So \u25cb\u25a1\u2295=41.\n\nBut let me check if there's another possibility. For example, in equation 3, DE=16, could D=8 and E=2, making 8\u00d72=16. Let's try that.\n\nIf D=8, E=2.\n\nFrom equation 2: CD=14 \u2192 C=1, D=4 (from 14/4=3.5, which is not a digit). Wait, no. If CD=14, and D=8, then C=14/8=1.75, which is not a digit. So that doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, D=2, E=8 (since 2\u00d78=16). So D=2, E=8.\n\nThen equation 2: CD=14 \u2192 C=7, D=2 (since 7\u00d72=14). So C=7.\n\nFrom equation 1: AB=21 \u2192 A=2, B=1.\n\nFrom equation 3: DE=16 \u2192 D=2, E=8.\n\nSo symbols:\n\n\u2295=2\n\n\u25ca=1\n\n\u25a1=7\n\n\u25b3=2\n\n\u25cb=8\n\nThen equation 4: EC=8 and 7 \u2192 87.\n\nBut let's check:\n\nEquation 1: AB=21 \u2192 2 and 1 \u2192 21. Correct.\n\nEquation 2: CD=14 \u2192 7 and 2 \u2192 72. But 72\u226014. So that doesn't work. So this is invalid.\n\nTherefore, the first possibility where D=4, E=4 works better.\n\nSo symbols:\n\n\u2295=2\n\n\u25ca=1\n\n\u25a1=1\n\n\u25b3=4\n\n\u25cb=4\n\nThen equation 4: EC=4 and 1 \u219241.\n\nBut let's check equation 2 again: CD=14 \u2192 C=1, D=4 \u219214. Correct.\n\nEquation 3: DE=16 \u2192 D=4, E=4 \u219216. Correct.\n\nSo all equations are satisfied.\n\nTherefore, the value of \u25cb\u25a1\u2295 is E C A =4 1 2 \u2192 412? Wait, no. Wait, in equation 4, it's E C A. Wait, no, in the original problem, it's \u25cb\u25a1\u2295, which is E C A. So E=4, C=1, A=2 \u2192 4 1 2 \u2192412? But that seems too big. Wait, but in the equations, it's three symbols concatenated, so E C A is 4 1 2, which is 412.\n\nBut wait, in the equations given, the first equation is \u2295\u25ca\u25a1=21, which is A B C=2 1 1=211, which is not 21. Wait, that's a problem.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake here. If the equations are concatenations, then:\n\nEquation 1: A B C=21 \u2192 but 21 is two digits. So maybe it's A B=21, and C is something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the equations are the sum of two symbols, and the third is the result. Let me try that.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n\u2295 + \u25ca = \u25a1 =21 \u2192 But 21 is a two-digit number, which can't be the sum of two digits.\n\nAlternatively, maybe:\n\n\u2295 + \u25ca + \u25a1 =21\n\n\u25a1 + \u25ca + \u25b3 =14\n\n\u25b3 + \u2295 + \u25cb =16\n\nAnd we need to find \u25cb + \u25a1 + \u2295.\n\nSo let's set up the equations:\n\n1. A + B + C =21\n\n2. C + B + D =14\n\n3. D + A + E =16\n\n4. E + C + A = ?\n\nWe have five variables and three equations. To solve this, we might need to find relationships between variables.\n\nLet me subtract equation 2 from equation 1:\n\n(A + B + C) - (C + B + D) =21 -14 \u2192 A - D=7 \u2192 A = D +7\n\nSimilarly, subtract equation 3 from equation 1:\n\n(A + B + C) - (D + A + E) =21 -16 \u2192 B + C - D - E=5\n\nBut from A = D +7, let's substitute A in equation 3:\n\nD +7 + B + C =16 \u2192 B + C + D =9\n\nWait, equation 3 is D + A + E =16, and A = D +7, so:\n\nD + (D +7) + E =16 \u2192 2D +7 + E="

End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: In a certain symbolic system, the following equations are true:\n\n$\u2295\u25ca\u25a1 = 21$\n$\u25a1\u25ca\u25b3 = 14$\n$\u25b3\u2295\u25cb = 16$\n$\u25cb\u25a1\u2295 = ?$\n\nWhat number does $\u25cb\u25a1\u2295$ equal? Determine the value that each symbol represents. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I've got this problem here with some symbols and equations, and I need to figure out what each symbol stands for and then find the value of \u25cb\u25a1\u2295. Let me start by writing down the equations to make it clearer.\n\nThe equations are:\n1. \u2295\u25ca\u25a1 = 21\n2. \u25a1\u25ca\u25b3 = 14\n3. \u25b3\u2295\u25cb = 16\n4. \u25cb\u25a1\u2295 = ?\n\nOkay, so I have four equations with four unknowns: \u2295, \u25ca, \u25a1, and \u25b3. Each equation is an operation involving these symbols, resulting in a number. My goal is to find what each symbol represents and then compute \u25cb\u25a1\u2295.\n\nFirst, I'll assume that these symbols represent some kind of numbers or operations. Since the results are numbers (21, 14, 16), it's likely that the symbols represent single-digit numbers, maybe digits from 0 to 9, or perhaps letters standing for operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.\n\nBut given that the results are all two-digit numbers, it's more probable that each symbol represents a digit, and the operations are concatenation. For example, if \u2295 is 1, \u25ca is 2, and \u25a1 is 3, then \u2295\u25ca\u25a1 would be 123. But wait, 123 is a three-digit number, and the result is 21, which is two digits. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the operations are addition or multiplication. Let's explore that.\n\nLooking at the first equation: \u2295\u25ca\u25a1 = 21. If I consider that these symbols represent single-digit numbers and the operation is addition, then \u2295 + \u25ca + \u25a1 = 21. But that seems a bit high for three single-digit numbers. The maximum they could add up to is 27 (9+9+9), so 21 is possible.\n\nSimilarly, the second equation: \u25a1 + \u25ca + \u25b3 = 14. Again, possible with single-digit numbers.\n\nThe third equation: \u25b3 + \u2295 + \u25cb = 16. Also plausible.\n\nBut I'm not sure if they represent addition. Maybe they represent multiplication? Let's test that.\n\nIf \u2295 \u00d7 \u25ca \u00d7 \u25a1 = 21. But 21 factors into 3\u00d77. So maybe \u2295=3, \u25ca=7, and \u25a1=1? But then, let's check the second equation: \u25a1\u00d7\u25ca\u00d7\u25b3=14. If \u25a1=1, \u25ca=7, then 1\u00d77\u00d7\u25b3=14 \u21d2 \u25b3=2. Then the third equation: \u25b3 + \u2295 + \u25cb =16 \u21d2 2 + 3 + \u25cb=16 \u21d2 \u25cb=11, which is not a single digit. So that doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's concatenation. So, for example, if \u2295=2, \u25ca=1, \u25a1=3, then \u2295\u25ca\u25a1=213, which is way bigger than 21. So that can't be.\n\nWait, maybe the operations are not straightforward. Perhaps they represent something else, like exponents or digits multiplied together. For example, 2\u00d73=6, but 21 is 2 and 1, so maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps these symbols represent the numbers themselves, and the operations are the standard arithmetic operations, but I need to find which operation fits each equation.\n\nLet me consider that each symbol is a single digit, and the operations are addition. So:\n\n1. \u2295 + \u25ca + \u25a1 = 21\n2. \u25a1 + \u25ca + \u25b3 =14\n3. \u25b3 + \u2295 + \u25cb =16\n4. \u25cb + \u25a1 + \u2295 = ?\n\nI need to find values for \u2295, \u25ca, \u25a1, and \u25b3 such that these equations hold.\n\nLet me denote:\nEquation 1: a + b + c =21\nEquation 2: c + b + d =14\nEquation 3: d + a + e =16\nEquation 4: e + c + a = ?\n\nI need to solve for a, b, c, d, e.\n\nFrom Equation 1: a + b + c =21\nFrom Equation 2: c + b + d =14\nSubtract Equation 2 from Equation 1: (a + b + c) - (c + b + d) =21 -14 \u21d2 a - d =7 \u21d2 a = d +7\n\nFrom Equation 3: d + a + e =16\nBut a = d +7, so substitute:\nd + (d +7) + e =16 \u21d2 2d +7 + e =16 \u21d2 2d + e =9\n\nFrom Equation 1: a + b + c =21\nFrom Equation 2: c + b + d =14\nSubtract Equation 2 from Equation 1: a - d =7 (as before)\n\nNow, from Equation 3: 2d + e =9\nSo e =9 -2d\n\nAlso, from Equation 1: a = d +7\n\nSo let's list possible values for d, since d must be a digit (0-9). Let's see what e would be:\n\nIf d=0: e=9\nIf d=1: e=7\nIf d=2: e=5\nIf d=3: e=3\nIf d=4: e=1\nIf d=5: e=-1 (invalid)\nSo d can be 0,1,2,3,4.\n\nNow, let's consider Equation 1: a + b + c=21\nSince a =d +7, and d can be 0-4, a would be 7,8,9,10,11. But a must be a single digit, so a \u22649. Therefore, d can only be 0,1,2.\n\nBecause:\n- d=0 \u21d2 a=7\n- d=1 \u21d2 a=8\n- d=2 \u21d2 a=9\n- d=3 \u21d2 a=10 (invalid)\n- d=4 \u21d2 a=11 (invalid)\n\nSo d can be 0,1,2.\n\nLet's consider each case:\n\nCase 1: d=0 \u21d2 a=7, e=9\nFrom Equation 2: c + b +0=14 \u21d2 c + b=14\nFrom Equation 1:7 + b + c=21 \u21d2 b + c=14 (same as Equation 2)\nSo that's consistent.\n\nFrom Equation 3:0 +7 +9=16, which is correct.\n\nNow, from Equation 4: e + c + a =9 + c +7=16 +c= ?\n\nBut we need to find \u25cb\u25a1\u2295=e + c + a.\n\nWait, in the problem, the fourth equation is \u25cb\u25a1\u2295= ?. So if e=\u25cb, c=\u25a1, a=\u2295, then e + c + a=9 + c +7=16 +c.\n\nBut we need to find the value, so we need to determine c.\n\nFrom Equation 2: c + b=14\nFrom Equation 1:7 + b + c=21 \u21d2 b +c=14, same as Equation 2.\n\nSo we have:\n\nb + c=14\n\nBut b and c are digits (0-9). Let's see possible pairs:\n\nc can be from 5 to 9 because b must be at least 0.\n\nIf c=5, b=9\nc=6, b=8\nc=7, b=7\nc=8, b=6\nc=9, b=5\n\nSo possible (b,c) pairs: (9,5),(8,6),(7,7),(6,8),(5,9)\n\nNow, let's see if any of these lead to contradictions elsewhere.\n\nBut wait, in this case, d=0, so from Equation 3: d + a + e=0+7+9=16, which is correct.\n\nFrom Equation 4: e + c + a=9 + c +7=16 +c.\n\nSo we need to find c, but we don't have more equations. However, we can note that in Equation 4, the result is 16 +c, and since c is a digit, 16 +c can range from 16 to 25.\n\nBut the problem doesn't give us the value of Equation 4, so perhaps we can't determine c uniquely. However, maybe there's more constraints.\n\nWait, perhaps the symbols represent something else, like letters corresponding to digits, but I think the approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the operations are multiplication.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nAssume that the symbols represent digits, and the operations are multiplication.\n\nSo:\n\n1. \u2295 \u00d7 \u25ca \u00d7 \u25a1 =21\n2. \u25a1 \u00d7 \u25ca \u00d7 \u25b3 =14\n3. \u25b3 \u00d7 \u2295 \u00d7 \u25cb =16\n4. \u25cb \u00d7 \u25a1 \u00d7 \u2295 = ?\n\nLet's denote a=\u2295, b=\u25ca, c=\u25a1, d=\u25b3, e=\u25cb\n\nThen:\n\nEquation 1: a \u00d7 b \u00d7 c =21\nEquation 2: c \u00d7 b \u00d7 d =14\nEquation 3: d \u00d7 a \u00d7 e =16\nEquation 4: e \u00d7 c \u00d7 a = ?\n\nWe need to find a,b,c,d,e.\n\nLet's factorize the numbers:\n\n21=3\u00d77\n14=2\u00d77\n16=2^4\n\nLooking for digits, so possible factors are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.\n\nFrom Equation 1: a\u00d7b\u00d7c=21=3\u00d77. So possible triples (a,b,c):\n\nSince all must be single-digit numbers:\n\nPossible combinations:\n\n- (1,3,7)\n- (1,7,3)\n- (3,1,7)\n- (3,7,1)\n- (7,1,3)\n- (7,3,1)\n\nSimilarly, Equation 2: c\u00d7b\u00d7d=14=2\u00d77.\n\nPossible triples (c,b,d):\n\n- (1,2,7)\n- (1,7,2)\n- (2,1,7)\n- (2,7,1)\n- (7,1,2)\n- (7,2,1)\n\nEquation 3: d\u00d7a\u00d7e=16=2^4.\n\nPossible triples (d,a,e):\n\n- (2,2,4)\n- (2,4,2)\n- (4,2,2)\n\nBut since d,a,e are digits, and d is also in Equation 2.\n\nNow, let's try to find overlapping variables.\n\nFrom Equation 1 and Equation 2:\n\nEquation 1: a\u00d7b\u00d7c=21\nEquation 2: c\u00d7b\u00d7d=14\n\nSo c\u00d7b is a common factor. Let's denote c\u00d7b=k.\n\nThen, Equation 1: k\u00d7a=21 \u21d2 a=21/k\nEquation 2: k\u00d7d=14 \u21d2 d=14/k\n\nSince a and d must be integers (digits), k must be a common factor of 21 and 14.\n\nFactors of 21:1,3,7,21\nFactors of 14:1,2,7,14\n\nCommon factors:1,7\n\nSo possible k=1 or k=7.\n\nCase 1: k=1\n\nThen, a=21/1=21 (invalid, since a must be single-digit)\nSo k cannot be 1.\n\nCase 2: k=7\n\nThen, a=21/7=3\nd=14/7=2\n\nSo a=3, d=2.\n\nNow, from Equation 1: a\u00d7b\u00d7c=21 \u21d23\u00d7b\u00d7c=21 \u21d2b\u00d7c=7\n\nPossible (b,c) pairs: (1,7),(7,1)\n\nFrom Equation 2: c\u00d7b\u00d7d=14 \u21d27\u00d7d=14 \u21d2d=2 (which matches our previous result)\n\nSo possible (b,c):\n\nIf b=1, c=7\nIf b=7, c=1\n\nNow, let's check Equation 3: d\u00d7a\u00d7e=16 \u21d22\u00d73\u00d7e=16 \u21d26\u00d7e=16 \u21d2e=16/6\u22482.666\u2026 (not integer)\nInvalid.\n\nSo this case doesn't work.\n\nWait, that's a problem. So k=7 leads to e being non-integer.\n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let's recalculate:\n\nFrom Equation 3: d\u00d7a\u00d7e=16 \u21d22\u00d73\u00d7e=16 \u21d26e=16 \u21d2e=16/6=8/3\u22482.666, which is not an integer.\n\nSo this is invalid.\n\nThus, k=7 doesn't work because e is not an integer.\n\nSo perhaps the operations are not multiplication. Let me try addition again.\n\nEarlier, I had:\n\nCase 1: d=0, a=7, e=9\n\nFrom Equation 2: c + b=14\nFrom Equation 1: a + b + c=21 \u21d27 +14=21, which is correct.\n\nNow, from Equation 3: d + a + e=0 +7 +9=16, which is correct.\n\nSo that works.\n\nNow, from Equation 4: e + c + a=9 + c +7=16 +c.\n\nBut we need to find c.\n\nFrom Equation 2: c + b=14, and b is a digit (0-9). So c can be from 5 to9.\n\nBut we don't have more equations to determine c. However, perhaps the problem expects us to find the value of \u25cb\u25a1\u2295, which is e + c + a=16 +c.\n\nBut without knowing c, we can't determine the exact value. However, maybe there's a unique solution.\n\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let's check if d=0 is the only possibility.\n\nEarlier, I considered d=0,1,2 because a=d+7 must be \u22649.\n\nBut let's see if there are other possibilities.\n\nWait, from Equation 3: 2d + e=9\n\nIf d=3, a=10 (invalid)\nd=4, a=11 (invalid)\nSo only d=0,1,2.\n\nCase 2: d=1 \u21d2 a=8, e=7 (since 2*1 + e=9 \u21d2e=7)\n\nFrom Equation 2: c + b +1=14 \u21d2c + b=13\nFrom Equation 1:8 + b + c=21 \u21d2b +c=13, same as Equation 2.\n\nSo consistent.\n\nFrom Equation 3:1 +8 +7=16, correct.\n\nNow, from Equation 4: e + c + a=7 + c +8=15 +c.\n\nAgain, c can be from 4 to9 (since b=13 -c, and b must be \u22649 \u21d2c\u22654)\n\nPossible c=4,5,6,7,8,9\n\nBut without more info, can't determine c.\n\nCase3: d=2 \u21d2a=9, e=5 (since 2*2 +5=9)\n\nFrom Equation 2: c + b +2=14 \u21d2c + b=12\nFrom Equation 1:9 + b + c=21 \u21d2b +c=12, same as Equation 2.\n\nConsistent.\n\nFrom Equation 3:2 +9 +5=16, correct.\n\nFrom Equation 4: e +c +a=5 +c +9=14 +c.\n\nAgain, c can be from 3 to9 (since b=12 -c, and b\u22649 \u21d2c\u22653)\n\nSo in all cases, we have multiple possibilities for c, leading to different values for Equation 4.\n\nBut the problem states that there is a solution, so perhaps I'm missing a constraint.\n\nWait, maybe the symbols represent letters corresponding to digits, and the operations are concatenation. Let me try that.\n\nAssume that each symbol is a digit, and the operation is concatenation, so for example, \u2295\u25ca\u25a1 would be the number formed by concatenating the digits represented by \u2295, \u25ca, and \u25a1.\n\nSo, for example, if \u2295=2, \u25ca=1, \u25a1=3, then \u2295\u25ca\u25a1=213.\n\nBut in the problem, \u2295\u25ca\u25a1=21, which is two digits. So perhaps the operation is not concatenation but something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the operation is exponentiation or something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the symbols represent letters in the alphabet, and the equations are about the positions in the alphabet. For example, A=1, B=2, etc.\n\nLet me explore that.\n\nAssume that each symbol corresponds to a letter, and their positions in the alphabet are the numbers given.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nIf \u2295=A, \u25ca=B, \u25a1=C, then \u2295\u25ca\u25a1=ABC=21.\n\nBut ABC is the number 21, which doesn't make sense because ABC would be a three-letter word, not a number. So perhaps the operation is the sum of their positions.\n\nSo, A=1, B=2, C=3, etc.\n\nSo, \u2295 + \u25ca + \u25a1 =21.\n\nSimilarly, \u25a1 + \u25ca + \u25b3=14\n\n\u25b3 + \u2295 + \u25cb=16\n\n\u25cb + \u25a1 + \u2295=?\n\nLet me try this approach.\n\nLet me assign:\n\n\u2295=a, \u25ca=b, \u25a1=c, \u25b3=d, \u25cb=e\n\nSo:\n\n1. a + b + c =21\n2. c + b + d=14\n3. d + a + e=16\n4. e + c + a=?\n\nWe need to solve for a,b,c,d,e.\n\nFrom Equation 1 and 2:\n\nSubtract Equation 2 from Equation 1: (a + b + c) - (c + b + d)=21 -14=7 \u21d2a - d=7 \u21d2a=d+7\n\nFrom Equation 3: d + a + e=16\n\nBut a=d+7, so:\n\nd + (d +7) + e=16 \u21d22d +7 + e=16 \u21d22d + e=9\n\nSo e=9 -2d\n\nFrom Equation 1: a + b + c=21 \u21d2(d +7) + b + c=21 \u21d2b + c=14 -d\n\nFrom Equation 2: c + b + d=14 \u21d2 same as above.\n\nSo, we have:\n\ne=9 -2d\n\nAnd b + c=14 -d\n\nNow, since a,b,c,d,e are letters, their corresponding numbers are 1-26.\n\nBut from Equation 1: a + b + c=21. Since a,b,c\u22651, the maximum they can sum to is 26+25+24=75, but 21 is manageable.\n\nBut let's see possible values for d.\n\nFrom e=9 -2d"

Determine the value that each symbol represents. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this problem here with some symbols and equations, and I need to figure out what each symbol stands for and then solve for \u25cb\u25a1\u2295. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's list out the equations we have:\n\n1. \u2295\u25ca\u25a1 = 21\n2. \u25a1\u25ca\u25b3 = 14\n3. \u25b3\u2295\u25cb = 16\n4. \u25cb\u25a1\u2295 = ? (This is the one we need to find)\n\nHmm, okay. So, we have four symbols: \u2295, \u25ca, \u25a1, and \u25b3. And we have three equations with these symbols, and we need to find the fourth. The goal is to find the values of each symbol and then compute \u25cb\u25a1\u2295.\n\nLet me denote each symbol with a variable to make it easier. Let's say:\n\n- Let \u2295 = A\n- Let \u25ca = B\n- Let \u25a1 = C\n- Let \u25b3 = D\n\nSo now, the equations become:\n\n1. A * B * C = 21\n2. C * B * D = 14\n3. D * A * E = 16 (Wait, hold on, in the original equation it's \u25b3\u2295\u25cb, which is D * A * E? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, let's correct that.)\n\nWait, actually, in equation 3, it's \u25b3\u2295\u25cb. So that would be D * A * E? No, wait, no. Wait, in the original, it's \u25b3\u2295\u25cb. So that would be D * A * E, but E isn't in our system. Wait, no, hold on, in the problem statement, the symbols are only \u2295, \u25ca, \u25a1, and \u25b3. So in equation 3, \u25b3\u2295\u25cb, which would be D * A * E? Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think.\n\nWait, no, in the equations, each equation is a single operation. So equation 1 is \u2295\u25ca\u25a1, which is A B C, but is it multiplication or some other operation? Wait, the problem says these are equations, but it doesn't specify the operation. Hmm, that's a bit confusing.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the following equations are true,\" but it doesn't specify what operation is being performed. Are these multiplications, additions, or something else? Hmm, that's a problem. Because if it's not specified, I can't assume multiplication. Wait, but looking at the numbers, 21, 14, 16, these are all multiples of each other, so maybe it's multiplication.\n\nLet me assume that the operation is multiplication. So, each equation is a product of the symbols. So:\n\n1. A * B * C = 21\n2. C * B * D = 14\n3. D * A * E = 16? Wait, no, again, in equation 3, it's \u25b3\u2295\u25cb, which is D * A * E? Wait, no, no, wait, it's \u25b3\u2295\u25cb, which would be D * A * E? Wait, but E isn't defined. Wait, no, in the problem, the symbols are only \u2295, \u25ca, \u25a1, and \u25b3. So, in equation 3, it's \u25b3\u2295\u25cb, which would be D * A * something? Wait, no, no, no, wait, maybe it's D * A * something else. Wait, no, no, no, perhaps it's D * A * E, but E isn't part of the system. Wait, this is confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps I misinterpreted the operation. Maybe it's not multiplication. Maybe it's addition. Let's see:\n\nIf it's addition, then:\n\n1. A + B + C = 21\n2. C + B + D = 14\n3. D + A + E = 16? Wait, no, same problem. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe it's concatenation? Like, combining numbers. But 21 is a two-digit number, 14 is two-digit, 16 is two-digit. So maybe the symbols represent digits, and the equations are forming two-digit numbers. That could make sense.\n\nSo, for example, \u2295\u25ca\u25a1 could be a two-digit number where \u2295 is the first digit and \u25ca\u25a1 is the second digit, making a two-digit number equal to 21. Similarly, \u25a1\u25ca\u25b3 would be 14, and \u25b3\u2295\u25cb would be 16.\n\nIf that's the case, then each equation represents a two-digit number where the first symbol is the tens digit and the combination of the next two symbols is the units digit.\n\nSo, let's try that approach.\n\nLet me define:\n\n- \u2295 = A (tens digit)\n- \u25ca = B (units digit of the first number)\n- \u25a1 = C (units digit of the first number)\n- \u25b3 = D (tens digit of the second number)\n- \u25cb = E (units digit of the second number)\n\nWait, but in equation 3, it's \u25b3\u2295\u25cb, which would be D A E, making the number D A E, which is a three-digit number, but the result is 16, which is a two-digit number. That doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe it's different. Maybe each equation is a three-symbol operation, but the result is a two-digit number. So, for example, \u2295\u25ca\u25a1 could be a two-digit number where \u2295 is the first digit and \u25ca\u25a1 is the second digit. So, \u2295 is the tens digit, and \u25ca\u25a1 is the units digit, which would be a two-digit number.\n\nSimilarly, \u25a1\u25ca\u25b3 would be another two-digit number where \u25a1 is the tens digit and \u25ca\u25b3 is the units digit.\n\nAnd \u25b3\u2295\u25cb would be another two-digit number where \u25b3 is the tens digit and \u2295\u25cb is the units digit.\n\nIf that's the case, then:\n\n1. \u2295 (tens) \u25ca (units) \u25a1 (units) = 21\nWait, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe it's \u2295 (tens) \u25ca (units) \u25a1 (tens) for the next equation? No, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think that each equation is a three-symbol operation, but the result is a two-digit number, meaning that the operation is concatenation of the three symbols, but that's not standard. Alternatively, maybe it's multiplication, but that would require three numbers, which could be single-digit numbers.\n\nWait, let me think again. If the symbols represent digits, and the equations are two-digit numbers where the first symbol is the tens digit and the next two symbols form the units digit. So, for example:\n\n\u2295\u25ca\u25a1 = 21 would mean that \u2295 is the tens digit and \u25ca\u25a1 is the units digit, which is a two-digit number 21. So, \u2295 is 2, and \u25ca\u25a1 is 1. But \u25ca and \u25a1 are both digits, so \u25ca is 1 and \u25a1 is 0? Because 21 is 2 and 10? Wait, no, because 21 is 2 and 1, but that would require only one digit for the units place. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each equation is the sum of the three symbols. So, \u2295 + \u25ca + \u25a1 = 21, etc. But then, we have three equations with four variables, which is underdetermined. So, we might need another equation or some constraints.\n\nBut the problem says there are four equations, but only three are given. Wait, no, the problem states four equations, but only three are provided. Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\n\"In a certain symbolic system, the following equations are true:\n\n\u2295\u25ca\u25a1 = 21\n\n\u25a1\u25ca\u25b3 = 14\n\n\u25b3\u2295\u25cb = 16\n\n\u25cb\u25a1\u2295 = ?\"\n\nSo, four equations, but the fourth one is the one we need to solve. So, the first three are given, and the fourth is to be found. So, we have three equations with four variables, which is underdetermined. So, perhaps there's a way to find the values uniquely.\n\nAlternatively, if the operations are multiplications, perhaps we can find the values.\n\nWait, let's go back. Let's assume that each equation is a product of three symbols, i.e., multiplication.\n\nSo:\n\n1. A * B * C = 21\n2. C * B * D = 14\n3. D * A * E = 16\n4. E * C * F = ? (Wait, no, the fourth equation is \u25cb\u25a1\u2295, which would be E * C * A? Wait, no, let's correct.\n\nWait, no, the fourth equation is \u25cb\u25a1\u2295, which would correspond to E * C * A, but that's assuming the operation is multiplication. Wait, but in equation 3, it's \u25b3\u2295\u25cb = 16, which would be D * A * E = 16.\n\nBut then, in equation 1, A * B * C =21\n\nEquation 2: C * B * D =14\n\nEquation 3: D * A * E =16\n\nAnd equation 4: E * C * A = ?\n\nWait, but this seems like a lot of variables. We have A, B, C, D, E. Five variables, but only three equations. So, unless there's more constraints, it's hard to solve.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the operation is addition, so:\n\n1. A + B + C =21\n2. C + B + D =14\n3. D + A + E =16\n4. E + C + A = ?\n\nBut again, with four variables and three equations, it's underdetermined.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the operation is concatenation, like forming numbers. So, for example, \u2295\u25ca\u25a1 could be a two-digit number where \u2295 is the first digit and \u25ca\u25a1 is the second digit, making a two-digit number. But that would require two digits for the second position, which isn't possible unless it's a three-digit number.\n\nWait, perhaps each equation is a three-digit number, but the result is a two-digit number. That doesn't make sense either.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each equation is a single digit, but that can't be because 21 is two digits.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think differently. Maybe the operation is exponentiation or something else.\n\nWait, but without knowing the operation, it's hard to proceed. Maybe I can look for patterns.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the symbols represent digits in a cryptarithmetic puzzle, where each letter stands for a unique digit. So, for example, in the first equation, \u2295\u25ca\u25a1 =21, which would mean that \u2295 is a digit, \u25ca is a digit, \u25a1 is a digit, and their combination makes 21.\n\nBut 21 is a two-digit number, so perhaps it's the concatenation of the three digits? But that would make it a three-digit number, which is 21, but that's only two digits. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the sum of the three digits, but 21 is a two-digit number, so that might not fit.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think that each equation is a product of three single-digit numbers, so A * B * C =21, etc.\n\nSo, let's proceed with that assumption.\n\nSo, we have:\n\n1. A * B * C =21\n2. C * B * D =14\n3. D * A * E =16\n4. E * C * A = ?\n\nWe need to find A, B, C, D, E such that these equations hold, with A, B, C, D, E being digits (0-9), and likely unique.\n\nSo, let's try to find A, B, C, D, E.\n\nFirst, from equation 1: A * B * C =21.\n\n21 factors into 1*3*7, or 3*7*1, or 21*1*1, but since they are digits, 21 is too big for a single digit, so the factors must be 1, 3, 7 in some order.\n\nSo, possible combinations for A, B, C are permutations of 1,3,7.\n\nSimilarly, equation 2: C * B * D =14.\n\n14 factors into 1*2*7, 2*7*1, 14*1*1 (but 14 is too big). So, possible factors are 1,2,7.\n\nEquation 3: D * A * E =16.\n\n16 factors into 1*2*8, 2*8*1, 4*4*1, etc.\n\nSo, let's try to find values that satisfy all three equations.\n\nFrom equation 1: A, B, C are 1,3,7 in some order.\n\nFrom equation 2: C, B, D are 1,2,7 in some order.\n\nSo, from equation 1 and 2, B is common, so B must be a common digit between the two.\n\nLooking at equation 1, B is either 1,3, or7.\n\nLooking at equation 2, B is either 1,2, or7.\n\nSo, the common possible values for B are 1 and7.\n\nSo, B=1 or B=7.\n\nLet's try B=1 first.\n\nIf B=1, then from equation 1: A and C must be 3 and7.\n\nFrom equation 2: C and D must be 2 and7, since B=1.\n\nBut from equation 1, C is either3 or7.\n\nSo, if C is3, then from equation 2, C=3, but equation 2 requires C to be 2 or7. So, that's a conflict.\n\nIf C=7, then from equation 2, C=7, and D must be 2 (since B=1 and C=7). So, D=2.\n\nSo, so far:\n\nB=1\n\nC=7\n\nD=2\n\nFrom equation 1: A=3 (since A and C are 3 and7, and C=7)\n\nSo, A=3\n\nFrom equation 3: D * A * E =16\n\nD=2, A=3, so 2 * 3 * E =16 \u2192 6 * E =16 \u2192 E=16/6\u22482.666, which is not an integer. So, that's impossible.\n\nSo, B=1 leads to a non-integer E, which is invalid.\n\nSo, B=1 is not possible.\n\nNow, try B=7.\n\nFrom equation 1: A and C are 1 and3.\n\nFrom equation 2: C and D are 1 and2.\n\nSo, C must be common between the two.\n\nFrom equation 1, C is either1 or3.\n\nFrom equation 2, C is either1 or2.\n\nSo, the only common value is C=1.\n\nThus, C=1.\n\nSo, from equation 1: A and C=1, so A must be3 (since 1 and3 are the other factors).\n\nSo, A=3.\n\nFrom equation 2: C=1, B=7, so D must be2 (since 1*7*D=14 \u2192 D=2).\n\nSo, D=2.\n\nFrom equation 3: D=2, A=3, so 2 * 3 * E=16 \u2192 6E=16 \u2192 E=16/6\u22482.666, which again is not an integer. So, invalid.\n\nHmm, that's a problem. Both B=1 and B=7 lead to E not being an integer. So, perhaps my assumption that the operation is multiplication is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the operation is addition, but let's try that.\n\nSo, if the operation is addition:\n\n1. A + B + C =21\n2. C + B + D =14\n3. D + A + E =16\n4. E + C + A = ?\n\nSo, we have four variables: A, B, C, D, E. Wait, no, five variables. Hmm.\n\nBut let's try.\n\nFrom equation 1: A + B + C =21\n\nFrom equation 2: C + B + D =14\n\nFrom equation 3: D + A + E =16\n\nWe need to find A, B, C, D, E such that all are digits (0-9), likely unique.\n\nLet me subtract equation 2 from equation 1:\n\n(A + B + C) - (C + B + D) =21 -14 \u2192 A - D =7 \u2192 A = D +7\n\nSimilarly, from equation 3: D + A + E =16\n\nBut A = D +7, so:\n\nD + (D +7) + E =16 \u2192 2D +7 + E =16 \u2192 2D + E =9\n\nSo, 2D + E =9\n\nWe also have from equation 2: C + B + D =14\n\nAnd from equation 1: A + B + C =21, which is (D +7) + B + C =21 \u2192 D + B + C =14\n\nWait, that's interesting. From equation 1 and equation 2, both equal 14:\n\nFrom equation 1: D + B + C =14\n\nFrom equation 2: C + B + D =14\n\nSo, both are the same equation. So, no new information.\n\nSo, the key equations are:\n\nA = D +7\n\n2D + E =9\n\nWe also have from equation 3: D + A + E =16, which is D + (D+7) + E =16 \u2192 2D +7 + E =16 \u2192 2D + E =9, which is the same as above.\n\nSo, we have:\n\nA = D +7\n\n2D + E =9\n\nWe need to find D and E such that A and E are digits (0-9).\n\nAlso, from equation 2: C + B + D =14\n\nFrom equation 1: A + B + C =21, which is (D+7) + B + C =21 \u2192 B + C =21 - (D +7) =14 - D\n\nBut from equation 2: B + C =14 - D\n\nSo, same as equation 2.\n\nSo, the key is to find D such that E =9 -2D is a digit (0-9).\n\nSo, 9 -2D \u22650 \u2192 D \u22644.5, so D can be 0,1,2,3,4.\n\nAlso, A = D +7 must be \u22649, so D \u22642.\n\nSo, D can be 0,1,2.\n\nLet's try D=0:\n\nThen, E=9-0=9\n\nA=0+7=7\n\nFrom equation 2: B"

End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: In a certain symbolic system, the following equations are true:\n\n$\u2295\u25ca\u25a1 = 21$\n$\u25a1\u25ca\u25b3 = 14$\n$\u25b3\u2295\u25cb = 16$\n$\u25cb\u25a1\u2295 = ?$\n\nWhat number does $\u25cb\u25a1\u2295$ equal? Determine the value that each symbol represents. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I've got this problem here with some symbols and equations, and I need to figure out what each symbol stands for and ultimately find the value of \u25cb\u25a1\u2295. Let me start by writing down the given equations to get a clear picture.\n\nFirst, the equations are:\n\n1. \u2295\u25ca\u25a1 = 21\n2. \u25a1\u25ca\u25b3 = 14\n3. \u25b3\u2295\u25cb = 16\n4. \u25cb\u25a1\u2295 = ?\n\nHmm, okay. So, each equation is an operation involving three symbols, and each operation equals a specific number. I need to find what each symbol represents. Since there are four equations and four unknowns (the symbols \u2295, \u25ca, \u25a1, and \u25b3), it seems solvable with some algebra.\n\nLet me assign variables to each symbol to make it easier. Let's say:\n\n- Let \u2295 = A\n- Let \u25ca = B\n- Let \u25a1 = C\n- Let \u25b3 = D\n\nNow, rewriting the equations with these variables:\n\n1. A * B * C = 21\n2. C * B * D = 14\n3. D * A * O = 16\n4. O * C * A = ?\n\nWait, hold on. The third equation was \u25b3\u2295\u25cb = 16, so that should be D * A * O = 16. But wait, I didn't define O yet. Let me correct that.\n\nLet me define each symbol properly:\n\n- \u2295 = A\n- \u25ca = B\n- \u25a1 = C\n- \u25b3 = D\n- \u25cb = E\n\nSo, the equations become:\n\n1. A * B * C = 21\n2. C * B * D = 14\n3. D * A * E = 16\n4. E * C * A = ?\n\nAlright, that makes sense now. So, four equations with five variables: A, B, C, D, E. Hmm, but since we have four equations, I might need to find ratios or express variables in terms of others.\n\nLet me list the equations again:\n\n1. A * B * C = 21  \u2192 Equation (1)\n2. C * B * D = 14  \u2192 Equation (2)\n3. D * A * E = 16  \u2192 Equation (3)\n4. E * C * A = ?    \u2192 Equation (4)\n\nI need to find E * C * A, which is Equation (4). So, maybe I can find expressions for E, C, and A from Equations (1), (2), and (3), and then multiply them together.\n\nFirst, let's see if I can find ratios or relationships between the variables.\n\nFrom Equation (1): A * B * C = 21\n\nFrom Equation (2): C * B * D = 14\n\nI can divide Equation (1) by Equation (2) to eliminate B and C:\n\n(A * B * C) / (C * B * D) = 21 / 14\n\nSimplifying:\n\nA / D = 3 / 2\n\nSo, A = (3/2) * D \u2192 Equation (5)\n\nThat's helpful. So, A is 1.5 times D.\n\nNow, from Equation (3): D * A * E = 16\n\nWe can substitute A from Equation (5) into Equation (3):\n\nD * (3/2 D) * E = 16\n\nSo, (3/2) * D^2 * E = 16 \u2192 Equation (6)\n\nHmm, so I have an equation involving D and E.\n\nI need another equation involving D and E. Let's see.\n\nFrom Equation (1): A * B * C = 21\n\nFrom Equation (2): C * B * D = 14\n\nIf I divide Equation (1) by Equation (2), I got A/D = 3/2, which is Equation (5).\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express B in terms of C from Equation (1) and plug into Equation (2).\n\nFrom Equation (1): A * B * C = 21 \u2192 B = 21 / (A * C)\n\nFrom Equation (2): C * B * D = 14 \u2192 Substitute B:\n\nC * (21 / (A * C)) * D = 14\n\nSimplify:\n\n(21 / A) * D = 14 \u2192 21D / A = 14\n\nFrom Equation (5), A = (3/2) D. Substitute that in:\n\n21D / ( (3/2) D ) = 14\n\nSimplify:\n\n21D * (2 / 3D) = 14 \u2192 (21 * 2) / 3 = 14\n\n42 / 3 = 14 \u2192 14 = 14\n\nHmm, that's a tautology, which means it doesn't give me new information. So, I need another approach.\n\nLet me try to express E in terms of D from Equation (6):\n\nFrom Equation (6): (3/2) D^2 * E = 16 \u2192 E = (16 * 2) / (3 D^2) \u2192 E = 32 / (3 D^2)\n\nSo, E = 32 / (3 D^2) \u2192 Equation (7)\n\nNow, from Equation (3): D * A * E = 16\n\nWe already have A = (3/2) D and E = 32 / (3 D^2), so let's plug those in:\n\nD * (3/2 D) * (32 / (3 D^2)) = 16\n\nSimplify:\n\nD * (3/2 D) * (32 / (3 D^2)) = (3/2) * (32 / 3) = (3/2) * (32 / 3) = 16\n\nWhich again simplifies to 16 = 16, so no new info.\n\nHmm, seems like I'm going in circles. Maybe I need to relate E to A or C.\n\nWait, in Equation (4): E * C * A = ?\n\nIf I can express E in terms of A or C, maybe I can find it.\n\nFrom Equation (7): E = 32 / (3 D^2)\n\nBut from Equation (5): A = (3/2) D \u2192 D = (2/3) A\n\nSo, substitute D in Equation (7):\n\nE = 32 / (3 * ( (2/3) A )^2 ) = 32 / (3 * (4/9 A^2)) ) = 32 / ( (12/9) A^2 ) = 32 / (4/3 A^2 ) = 32 * (3 / (4 A^2 )) = 24 / A^2\n\nSo, E = 24 / A^2 \u2192 Equation (8)\n\nNow, from Equation (3): D * A * E = 16\n\nWe have D = (2/3) A and E = 24 / A^2\n\nSubstitute into Equation (3):\n\n(2/3) A * A * (24 / A^2 ) = 16\n\nSimplify:\n\n(2/3) * A^2 * (24 / A^2 ) = (2/3) * 24 = 16\n\nWhich is 16 = 16, again not new info.\n\nThis is getting repetitive. Maybe I need to look at Equations (1) and (2) again.\n\nFrom Equation (1): A * B * C = 21\n\nFrom Equation (2): C * B * D = 14\n\nWe can take the ratio of these two equations:\n\n(A * B * C) / (C * B * D) = 21 / 14 \u2192 A / D = 3 / 2 \u2192 A = (3/2) D, which is Equation (5)\n\nSo, that's the only relationship we get from Equations (1) and (2).\n\nNow, let's look at Equations (1) and (3):\n\nFrom Equation (1): A * B * C = 21\n\nFrom Equation (3): D * A * E = 16\n\nWe can relate A and D: A = (3/2) D\n\nSo, substitute A into Equation (1):\n\n(3/2) D * B * C = 21 \u2192 (3/2) D * B * C = 21 \u2192 D * B * C = 14 \u2192 But wait, Equation (2) is C * B * D = 14, which is the same.\n\nSo, that's consistent, but doesn't give new info.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to express B in terms of A and C.\n\nFrom Equation (1): B = 21 / (A * C)\n\nFrom Equation (2): B = 14 / (C * D)\n\nSet them equal:\n\n21 / (A * C) = 14 / (C * D)\n\nSimplify:\n\n21 / A = 14 / D \u2192 21 D = 14 A \u2192 3 D = 2 A \u2192 D = (2/3) A\n\nWhich is consistent with Equation (5): A = (3/2) D \u2192 D = (2/3) A\n\nSo, again, no new info.\n\nMaybe I should express everything in terms of A.\n\nFrom Equation (5): D = (2/3) A\n\nFrom Equation (7): E = 32 / (3 D^2) = 32 / (3 * (4/9) A^2 ) = 32 / ( (12/9) A^2 ) = 32 * (9/12) / A^2 = (32 * 3/4) / A^2 = 24 / A^2\n\nSo, E = 24 / A^2\n\nFrom Equation (1): A * B * C = 21 \u2192 B = 21 / (A * C)\n\nFrom Equation (2): C * B * D = 14 \u2192 Substitute B:\n\nC * (21 / (A * C)) * D = 14 \u2192 (21 / A) * D = 14 \u2192 21 D = 14 A \u2192 3 D = 2 A \u2192 D = (2/3) A, which is consistent.\n\nSo, I think I need to find a value for A that satisfies all equations.\n\nWait, but since all equations are consistent, maybe I can assign a value to one variable and find the rest.\n\nLet me assume that all variables are integers. Since the results are 21, 14, 16, which are integers, it's likely that the symbols represent integers.\n\nSo, let's try to find integers A, B, C, D, E such that:\n\nA * B * C = 21\n\nC * B * D = 14\n\nD * A * E = 16\n\nAnd E * C * A = ?\n\nLet me list the factors of 21, 14, and 16.\n\nFactors of 21: 1, 3, 7, 21\n\nFactors of 14: 1, 2, 7, 14\n\nFactors of 16: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16\n\nLooking for common factors. Since A, B, C, D, E are likely positive integers, let's try to find possible values.\n\nFrom Equation (1): A * B * C = 21\n\nPossible triplets (A, B, C):\n\n(1,1,21), (1,3,7), (1,7,3), (1,21,1), (3,1,7), (3,3, 7/3) [not integer], (3,7,1), (7,1,3), (7,3,1), (21,1,1)\n\nSimilarly, Equation (2): C * B * D =14\n\nPossible triplets (C, B, D):\n\nSame as above, but product is 14.\n\nEquation (3): D * A * E =16\n\nPossible triplet (D, A, E): same as above, product 16.\n\nI need to find a consistent set of A, B, C, D, E that fit all three equations.\n\nLet's try possible values.\n\nFirst, from Equation (1), possible A, B, C:\n\nLet me try A=3, B=7, C=1 \u2192 3*7*1=21\n\nThen, Equation (2): C=1, B=7, so 1*7*D=14 \u2192 7D=14 \u2192 D=2\n\nThen, Equation (3): D=2, A=3, so 2*3*E=16 \u2192 6E=16 \u2192 E=16/6\u22482.666\u2026 Not integer. So, discard.\n\nNext, try A=7, B=3, C=1 \u2192 7*3*1=21\n\nEquation (2): C=1, B=3, so 1*3*D=14 \u2192 3D=14 \u2192 D=14/3\u22484.666\u2026 Not integer.\n\nDiscard.\n\nNext, A=1, B=21, C=1 \u2192 1*21*1=21\n\nEquation (2): C=1, B=21, so 1*21*D=14 \u2192 21D=14 \u2192 D=14/21=2/3\u22480.666\u2026 Not integer.\n\nDiscard.\n\nNext, A=1, B=3, C=7 \u2192 1*3*7=21\n\nEquation (2): C=7, B=3, so 7*3*D=14 \u219221D=14 \u2192 D=14/21=2/3\u22480.666\u2026 Not integer.\n\nDiscard.\n\nNext, A=1, B=7, C=3 \u2192 1*7*3=21\n\nEquation (2): C=3, B=7, so 3*7*D=14 \u219221D=14 \u2192 D=14/21=2/3\u22480.666\u2026 Not integer.\n\nDiscard.\n\nNext, A=21, B=1, C=1 \u219221*1*1=21\n\nEquation (2): C=1, B=1, so 1*1*D=14 \u2192 D=14\n\nEquation (3): D=14, A=21, so 14*21*E=16 \u2192294E=16\u2192 E=16/294\u22480.054\u2026 Not integer.\n\nDiscard.\n\nHmm, none of the integer triplets for Equation (1) seem to work. Maybe I need to consider that the variables don't have to be integers, but that complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a wrong assumption. Maybe the operations are not multiplication but something else, like addition or concatenation. But the problem uses symbols like \u2295, which often implies addition, but with three symbols, it's unclear.\n\nWait, the problem says \"In a certain symbolic system,\" so maybe the operations are defined differently. But since the results are numbers, perhaps it's multiplication.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the symbols represent digits, and the operations are concatenation or something else.\n\nWait, another approach: Maybe each symbol is a digit, and the operations are concatenation. For example, \u2295\u25ca\u25a1 could be a three-digit number where \u2295, \u25ca, \u25a1 are digits.\n\nBut in that case, the equations would be:\n\n1. \u2295\u25ca\u25a1 = 21 \u2192 a three-digit number, which doesn't make sense because 21 is two digits.\n\nSo, maybe it's addition. Let me consider that.\n\nIf \u2295, \u25ca, \u25a1, \u25b3, \u25cb are digits (0-9), and the equations are:\n\n1. \u2295 + \u25ca + \u25a1 = 21\n2. \u25a1 + \u25ca + \u25b3 =14\n3. \u25b3 + \u2295 + \u25cb =16\n4. \u25cb + \u25a1 + \u2295 = ?\n\nThat might make sense. Let's try that.\n\nSo, variables:\n\nA = \u2295, B = \u25ca, C = \u25a1, D = \u25b3, E = \u25cb.\n\nEquations:\n\n1. A + B + C =21 \u2192 Equation (1)\n2. C + B + D =14 \u2192 Equation (2)\n3. D + A + E =16 \u2192 Equation (3)\n4. E + C + A = ? \u2192 Equation (4)\n\nNow, let's try to solve these equations with A, B, C, D, E as digits (0-9).\n\nFrom Equation (1): A + B + C =21\n\nFrom Equation (2): C + B + D =14\n\nSubtract Equation (2) from Equation (1):\n\n(A + B + C) - (C + B + D) =21 -14 \u2192 A - D =7 \u2192 A = D +7 \u2192 Equation (5)\n\nFrom Equation (3): D + A + E =16\n\nSubstitute A from Equation (5): D + (D +7) + E =16 \u2192 2D +7 + E =16 \u2192 2D + E =9 \u2192 E =9 -2D \u2192 Equation (6)\n\nFrom Equation (1): A + B + C =21, and from Equation (2): C + B + D =14\n\nSubtract Equation (2) from Equation (1): A - D =7, which is Equation (5)\n\nAlso, from Equation (1): A =21 - B - C\n\nFrom Equation (2): D =14 - B - C\n\nFrom Equation (5): A = D +7 = (14 - B - C) +7 =21 - B - C\n\nWhich is consistent, so no new info.\n\nFrom Equation (3): D + A + E =16\n\nWe have A = D +7 and E =9 -2D\n\nSo, substitute into Equation (3):\n\nD + (D +7) + (9 -2D) =16 \u2192 D + D +7 +9 -2D =16 \u2192 (D + D -2D) + (7 +9) =16 \u2192 0D +16 =16 \u2192 16=16\n\nAgain, no new info.\n\nSo, I need to find possible integer values for D (since E =9 -2D must be non-negative, as it's a digit).\n\nSo, E =9 -2D \u22650 \u2192 9 \u22652D \u2192 D \u22644.5 \u2192 D can be 0,1,2,3,4\n\nAlso, D must be such that A = D +7 is \u22649, since A is a digit.\n\nSo, A = D +7 \u22649 \u2192 D \u22642\n\nThus, D can be 0,1,2\n\nLet's try D=2:\n\nThen, A=2+7=9\n\nE=9 -2*2=9-4=5\n\nNow, from Equation (1): A + B + C =21 \u21929 + B + C =21 \u2192 B + C =12\n\nFrom Equation (2): C + B + D =14 \u2192 C + B +2=14 \u2192 C + B=12\n\nConsistent with Equation (1).

Determine the value that each symbol represents. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this problem here with some symbols and equations, and I need to figure out what each symbol stands for and then find the value of \u25cb\u25a1\u2295. Let me see how I can approach this.\n\nFirst, let me write down the equations to have a clear view:\n\n1. \u2295\u25ca\u25a1 = 21\n2. \u25a1\u25ca\u25b3 = 14\n3. \u25b3\u2295\u25cb = 16\n4. \u25cb\u25a1\u2295 = ?\n\nHmm, okay. So, we have four equations with three unknowns: \u2295, \u25ca, and \u25a1, and another one with \u25cb. It seems like I need to solve for each symbol step by step.\n\nLet me think about how these symbols might operate. Since the results are numbers, maybe these symbols represent mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, or something else. It could also be that they represent single digits, but given the results are two-digit numbers, it's more likely they're operations.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"determine the value that each symbol represents,\" so maybe each symbol is a single digit. But then, how do we get two-digit numbers from operations of single digits? Maybe they represent two-digit numbers themselves, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps the symbols represent operations, and the equations are combining these operations to give the results.\n\nLet me consider that each symbol could represent a single digit. If that's the case, then each equation would be a combination of these digits. For example, \u2295\u25ca\u25a1 could be a three-digit number where each symbol is a digit. But that might not make sense because 21 is a two-digit number. So perhaps it's an operation between two digits.\n\nWait, maybe the symbols represent operations, and the equations are expressions involving these operations. For example, \u2295 could be addition, \u25ca could be multiplication, and \u25a1 could be subtraction. Let me test this idea.\n\nSo, let's assign:\n\n\u2295 = addition (+)\n\u25ca = multiplication (*)\n\u25a1 = subtraction (-)\n\nNow, let's plug these into the first equation: \u2295\u25ca\u25a1 = 21\n\nUsing the assigned operations: + * - = 21\n\nHmm, that doesn't make sense because we're performing three operations in a row, but the result is a single number. Maybe it's two operations. Wait, maybe the order is different. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the symbols represent different operations, and the order of operations matters. Let me try another approach.\n\nSuppose each symbol is a single digit, and the equations are the results of concatenating these digits. For example, if \u2295=1, \u25ca=2, \u25a1=3, then \u2295\u25ca\u25a1 would be 123, but that's not 21. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the symbols represent two-digit numbers, but that seems complicated. Let me think again.\n\nPerhaps the symbols represent operations, but the equations are written in a way that combines two operations. For example, \u2295\u25ca\u25a1 could mean (\u2295 \u25ca) \u25a1, or \u2295 (\u25ca \u25a1). Let me try that.\n\nSuppose \u2295 is addition, \u25ca is multiplication, and \u25a1 is subtraction. Let's see:\n\nFirst equation: \u2295\u25ca\u25a1 = 21\n\nIf it's (\u2295 \u25ca) \u25a1, that would be (+ *), which isn't an operation. Alternatively, \u2295 (\u25ca \u25a1) would be + (* -). But I'm not sure if that makes sense.\n\nWait, maybe the operations are in the order of the symbols, so \u2295 first, then \u25ca, then \u25a1. So, \u2295\u25ca\u25a1 could be \u2295(\u25ca(\u25a1)), but that would be more like a function. Let me try with numbers.\n\nLet me assign variables:\n\nLet\u2019s say:\n\n\u2295 = a\n\n\u25ca = b\n\n\u25a1 = c\n\nThen, the equations become:\n\n1. a \u25ca b \u25a1 = 21\n\nBut I don't know what the operations are. Maybe it's a combination like a + b * c = 21.\n\nSimilarly:\n\n2. b \u25a1 c = 14. So, maybe b * (c - something). Wait, no, if it's b * c, that would be bc, but 14 is two digits.\n\nWait, maybe the symbols represent two-digit numbers. Let me try that.\n\nSuppose each symbol is a two-digit number, and the equations are adding or subtracting them. For example:\n\n1. \u2295 + \u25ca - \u25a1 = 21\n\n2. \u25ca - \u25a1 + \u25b3 = 14\n\n3. \u25b3 + \u2295 - \u25cb = 16\n\nBut then we have four variables: \u2295, \u25ca, \u25a1, \u25b3, and \u25cb. That's five variables, which complicates things. Maybe it's better to think of symbols as single digits.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the symbols are single digits, and the equations are the sum of their values. Let me try that.\n\nLet\u2019s assign:\n\n\u2295 = a\n\n\u25ca = b\n\n\u25a1 = c\n\n\u25b3 = d\n\n\u25cb = e\n\nThen the equations are:\n\n1. a * b + c = 21\n\n2. b * c + d = 14\n\n3. d * a - e = 16\n\n4. e * c + a = ?\n\nBut wait, the first equation: a * b + c = 21\n\nSecond: b * c + d =14\n\nThird: d * a - e=16\n\nWe have five variables and three equations. Hmm, that's not enough. Maybe I need to make more assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the equations are using the symbols as operations, but the order matters. Let me think differently.\n\nSuppose each symbol represents a single digit, and the equations are the result of concatenating the digits. So, for example, if \u2295=1, \u25ca=2, \u25a1=3, then \u2295\u25ca\u25a1 would be 123, but that's not 21. So that doesn't work.\n\nWait, maybe the symbols represent two-digit numbers, and the operations are concatenation. For example, \u2295=10, \u25ca=20, \u25a1=30, but that seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the symbols are operations, and the equations are combining them in a way that results in numbers. Let me try assigning operations:\n\nLet\u2019s say:\n\n\u2295 = +\n\n\u25ca = *\n\n\u25a1 = -\n\n\u25b3 = /\n\n\u25cb = \u221a\n\nBut then, let's test the equations:\n\n1. \u2295\u25ca\u25a1 = + * - = 21\n\nHmm, that doesn't make sense. Operations can't be combined like that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the operations are in a different order. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the symbols represent the results of operations between two numbers. For example, \u2295 is the result of adding two numbers, \u25ca is the result of multiplying two numbers, and \u25a1 is the result of subtracting two numbers. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think of the symbols as variables and try to solve the equations step by step.\n\nLet me define:\n\nLet\u2019s say:\n\nEquation 1: \u2295 \u25ca \u25a1 =21\n\nEquation 2: \u25a1 \u25ca \u25b3 =14\n\nEquation 3: \u25b3 \u2295 \u25cb =16\n\nEquation 4: \u25cb \u25a1 \u2295 = ?\n\nWe have four equations and five variables. Hmm, that's tricky, but maybe we can find relationships between them.\n\nLet me try to express variables in terms of others.\n\nFrom Equation 1: \u2295 = (21 - \u25a1) / \u25ca\n\nFrom Equation 2: \u25b3 = (14 - \u25a1) / \u25ca\n\nFrom Equation 3: \u25cb = (16 - \u25b3) / \u2295\n\nBut this seems complicated because we have division involved. Maybe the operations are multiplication and addition.\n\nWait, perhaps the operations are multiplication and addition, and the symbols represent numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the symbols represent numbers, and the operations are concatenation. Let me try that.\n\nSuppose each symbol is a single digit, and the equations are the result of concatenating them. For example, \u2295=1, \u25ca=2, \u25a1=3, so \u2295\u25ca\u25a1=123, but that's not 21. So that doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the symbols represent two-digit numbers, but that seems too vague.\n\nWait, maybe the symbols represent the results of operations. Let me think differently.\n\nSuppose each symbol is a single digit, and the equations are the result of combining them with operations. For example:\n\nEquation 1: a \u25ca b + c =21\n\nEquation 2: b * c + d =14\n\nEquation 3: d * a - e =16\n\nEquation 4: e * c + a = ?\n\nBut again, with five variables, it's too many.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the symbols represent the results of operations, but the equations are using them in a way that the symbols are functions. For example, \u2295 is a function that takes two inputs and gives a result. But that seems too abstract.\n\nWait, perhaps the symbols are variables that can be solved step by step.\n\nLet me try to express variables in terms of others.\n\nFrom Equation 1: \u2295 = (21 - \u25a1) / \u25ca\n\nFrom Equation 2: \u25b3 = (14 - \u25a1) / \u25ca\n\nFrom Equation 3: \u25cb = (16 - \u25b3) / \u2295\n\nBut this is a system of equations with three equations and four variables, so maybe I can find a relation.\n\nWait, let's substitute \u25b3 from Equation 2 into Equation 3.\n\nFrom Equation 2: \u25b3 = (14 - \u25a1)/\u25ca\n\nFrom Equation 3: \u25cb = (16 - \u25b3)/\u2295 = (16 - (14 - \u25a1)/\u25ca ) / \u2295\n\nBut from Equation 1: \u2295 = (21 - \u25a1)/\u25ca\n\nSo, substituting \u2295:\n\n\u25cb = [16 - (14 - \u25a1)/\u25ca ] / [(21 - \u25a1)/\u25ca ]\n\nThis is getting messy, but let me try to simplify.\n\nFirst, let's compute numerator of \u25cb:\n\n16 - (14 - \u25a1)/\u25ca = (16*\u25ca - (14 - \u25a1))/\u25ca = (16\u25ca -14 + \u25a1)/\u25ca\n\nThen, divide by \u2295, which is (21 - \u25a1)/\u25ca:\n\n\u25cb = [ (16\u25ca -14 + \u25a1)/\u25ca ] / [ (21 - \u25a1)/\u25ca ] = (16\u25ca -14 + \u25a1) / (21 - \u25a1)\n\nSo, \u25cb = (16\u25ca + \u25a1 -14) / (21 - \u25a1)\n\nHmm, okay. Now, we have \u25cb in terms of \u25ca and \u25a1.\n\nBut we have four variables and three equations, so maybe we can find another relation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the operations are multiplication and addition.\n\nLet me try assuming that the symbols represent numbers and the operations are multiplication and addition.\n\nLet me define:\n\nLet\u2019s say:\n\n\u2295 = a\n\n\u25ca = b\n\n\u25a1 = c\n\n\u25b3 = d\n\n\u25cb = e\n\nThen the equations are:\n\n1. a * b + c =21\n\n2. b * c + d =14\n\n3. d * a - e =16\n\n4. e * c + a = ?\n\nWe need to find a, b, c, d, e.\n\nFrom Equation 1: a*b + c =21 \u2192 c=21 -a*b\n\nFrom Equation 2: b*c + d =14\n\nSubstitute c from Equation 1: b*(21 -a*b) + d =14 \u219221b -a*b\u00b2 + d =14 \u2192 d=14 -21b +a*b\u00b2\n\nFrom Equation 3: d*a - e =16\n\nSubstitute d from above: (14 -21b +a*b\u00b2)*a - e =16 \u219214a -21a*b +a\u00b2*b\u00b2 - e =16 \u2192 e=14a -21a*b +a\u00b2*b\u00b2 -16\n\nNow, from Equation 4: e*c + a = ?\n\nBut c=21 -a*b, so:\n\ne*(21 -a*b) +a = ?\n\nBut e is expressed in terms of a and b, so:\n\ne=14a -21a*b +a\u00b2*b\u00b2 -16\n\nThus, e*c +a = (14a -21a*b +a\u00b2*b\u00b2 -16)*(21 -a*b) +a\n\nThis seems too complicated. Maybe I need to find integer values for a, b, c, d, e.\n\nLet me try small integer values for a and b.\n\nFrom Equation 1: a*b + c =21, so c=21 -a*b.\n\nSince c must be positive, a*b <21.\n\nLet's try a=3, b=5: a*b=15, c=6\n\nThen, from Equation 2: b*c + d =14 \u21925*6 +d=14\u219230 +d=14\u2192d= -16, which is negative. Not possible.\n\nNext, a=4, b=5: 4*5=20, c=1\n\nEquation 2:5*1 +d=14\u21925 +d=14\u2192d=9\n\nEquation 3: d*a -e=16\u21929*4 -e=16\u219236 -e=16\u2192e=20\n\nNow, check if this works.\n\nSo, a=4, b=5, c=1, d=9, e=20\n\nCheck Equation 1:4*5 +1=21\u2713\n\nEquation 2:5*1 +9=14\u2713\n\nEquation 3:9*4 -20=36-20=16\u2713\n\nNow, Equation 4: e*c +a=20*1 +4=24\n\nSo, \u25cb\u25a1\u2295=24\n\nWait, but in the problem, the fourth equation is \u25cb\u25a1\u2295=?\n\nSo, the answer would be 24.\n\nBut let me check if there are other possible values.\n\nLet me try a=5, b=4: 5*4=20, c=1\n\nEquation 2:4*1 +d=14\u21924 +d=14\u2192d=10\n\nEquation 3:10*5 -e=16\u219250 -e=16\u2192e=34\n\nEquation 4:34*1 +5=39\n\nBut let's see if this works.\n\nFrom Equation 3: e=50-16=34\n\nSo, e=34, which is possible.\n\nBut let's see if this is consistent.\n\nSo, a=5, b=4, c=1, d=10, e=34\n\nCheck Equation 1:5*4 +1=21\u2713\n\nEquation 2:4*1 +10=14\u2713\n\nEquation 3:10*5 -34=50-34=16\u2713\n\nEquation 4:34*1 +5=39\n\nSo, another possible solution: 39.\n\nBut which one is correct? Maybe both are possible. Let me check if there are more solutions.\n\nLet me try a=2, b=10: 2*10=20, c=1\n\nEquation 2:10*1 +d=14\u219210 +d=14\u2192d=4\n\nEquation 3:4*2 -e=16\u21928 -e=16\u2192e= -8, which is negative. Not possible.\n\na=3, b=7: 3*7=21, c=0. But c=0 might be allowed.\n\nEquation 2:7*0 +d=14\u21920 +d=14\u2192d=14\n\nEquation 3:14*3 -e=16\u219242 -e=16\u2192e=26\n\nEquation 4:26*0 +3=3\n\nCheck: Equation 1:3*7 +0=21\u2713\n\nEquation 2:7*0 +14=14\u2713\n\nEquation 3:14*3 -26=42-26=16\u2713\n\nEquation 4:26*0 +3=3\n\nSo, another solution:3.\n\nHmm, so there are multiple solutions. But maybe the problem expects the smallest or the largest, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe the symbols represent digits, so c=1 is more likely, as in the first solution.\n\nIn the first solution, a=4, b=5, c=1, d=9, e=20\n\nSo, the symbols would be:\n\n\u2295=4\n\n\u25ca=5\n\n\u25a1=1\n\n\u25b3=9\n\n\u25cb=20\n\nBut wait, 20 is a two-digit number. Maybe symbols can represent numbers, not just digits.\n\nBut in the second solution, a=5, b=4, c=1, d=10, e=34\n\nSo, symbols would be:\n\n\u2295=5\n\n\u25ca=4\n\n\u25a1=1\n\n\u25b3=10\n\n\u25cb=34\n\nBut again, 10 and 34 are two-digit numbers.\n\nIn the third solution, a=3, b=7, c=0, d=14, e=26\n\nSo, symbols:\n\n\u2295=3\n\n\u25ca=7\n\n\u25a1=0\n\n\u25b3=14\n\n\u25cb=26\n\nAgain, two-digit numbers.\n\nBut the problem says \"determine the value that each symbol represents,\" which could be numbers, not necessarily single digits.\n\nBut in the first solution, where a=4, b=5, c=1, d=9, e=20\n\nWe have:\n\n\u2295=4\n\n\u25ca=5\n\n\u25a1=1\n\n\u25b3=9\n\n\u25cb=20\n\nThen, Equation 4: \u25cb\u25a1\u2295=20*1 +4=24\n\nAlternatively, if we interpret \u25cb\u25a1\u2295 as e*c +a=20*1 +4=24\n\nSimilarly, in the second solution, e=34, c=1, a=5: 34*1 +5=39\n\nIn the third solution, e=26, c=0, a=3:26*0 +3=3\n\nBut since the problem is in a symbolic system, it's possible that the symbols can represent numbers, not just digits.\n\nBut the problem might expect a unique solution. So, perhaps I need to find a unique solution where all symbols are single-digit numbers.\n\nLooking back, in the first solution, a=4, b=5, c=1, d=9, e=20\n\nBut e=20 is two digits, so that might not fit.\n\nIn the second solution, a=5, b=4, c=1, d=10, e=34\n\nAgain, d and e are two digits.\n\nIn the third solution, a=3, b=7, c=0, d=14, e=26\n\nAgain, two digits.\n\nSo, maybe the problem allows symbols to represent two-digit numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a wrong assumption about the operations.\n\nWait, maybe the operations are concatenation, and the equations are the result of concatenating the symbols"
