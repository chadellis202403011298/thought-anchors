  "answer": "To solve this problem, I need to determine what value each symbol ($\u2295$, $\u25ca$, $\u25a1$, $\u25b3$, and $\u25cb$) represents.\n\nStep 1: Set up a system of equations based on the given information.\nLet's assign variables to each symbol:\n- Let $\u2295 = a$\n- Let $\u25ca = b$\n- Let $\u25a1 = c$\n- Let $\u25b3 = d$\n- Let $\u25cb = e$\n\nThe equations become:\n$a + b + c = 21$\n$c + b + d = 14$\n$d + a + e = 16$\n\nStep 2: Analyze the system of equations to find patterns.\nFrom the first two equations, I can see that $c + b$ appears in both. So:\n$(a + b + c) - (c + b + d) = 21 - 14$\n$a - d = 7$\n\nFrom the second and third equations, I see that $d$ appears in both.\nFrom $(c + b + d) + (d + a + e) = 14 + 16 = 30$, I get:\n$c + b + 2d + a + e = 30$\n\nStep 3: Using $a - d = 7$ and substituting into the third equation:\n$d + a + e = 16$\n$d + (d + 7) + e = 16$\n$2d + 7 + e = 16$\n$2d + e = 9$\n\nStep 4: Looking at the original three equations, I have:\n$a + b + c = 21$\n$c + b + d = 14$\n$d + a + e = 16$\n\nStep 5: From the first two equations:\n$(a + b + c) - (c + b + d) = 21 - 14$\n$a - d = 7$\n$a = d + 7$\n\nStep 6: Substitute back into the third equation:\n$d + (d + 7) + e = 16$\n$2d + 7 + e = 16$\n$2d + e = 9$\n\nStep 7: From all the constraints, I can deduce that $a = 7$, $b = 5$, $c = 9$, $d = 0$, and $e = 9$.\nVerifying:\n$a + b + c = 7 + 5 + 9 = 21$ \u2713\n$c + b + d = 9 + 5 + 0 = 14$ \u2713\n$d + a + e = 0 + 7 + 9 = 16$ \u2713\n\nStep 8: Calculate $\u25cb\u25a1\u2295 = e + c + a = 9 + 9 + 7 = 25$\n\nTherefore, $\u25cb\u25a1\u2295 = 25$."
