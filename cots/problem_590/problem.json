  "question": "A small community college has two courses: Statistics and Psychology. 40% of all students take Statistics, 30% take Psychology, and 15% take both courses. If a student is selected at random from the college:\n\n1. Are the events 'student takes Statistics' and 'student takes Psychology' independent?\n2. What is the probability that a randomly selected student takes either Statistics or Psychology (or both)?",
  "answer": "To determine whether the events are independent and find the probability of a student taking either course, I'll work through this step by step.\n\nGiven information:\n- P(Statistics) = 0.40 (40% take Statistics)\n- P(Psychology) = 0.30 (30% take Psychology)\n- P(Statistics \u2229 Psychology) = 0.15 (15% take both)\n\nPart 1: Are the events independent?\n\nFor two events A and B to be independent, we must have P(A \u2229 B) = P(A) \u00d7 P(B).\n\nLet's check if this holds:\nP(Statistics) \u00d7 P(Psychology) = 0.40 \u00d7 0.30 = 0.12\n\nBut we're told that P(Statistics \u2229 Psychology) = 0.15\n\nSince 0.15 \u2260 0.12, the events are NOT independent. They are dependent events.\n\nThis makes intuitive sense: the actual overlap (15%) is greater than what we'd expect by chance (12%), suggesting that taking one course makes a student somewhat more likely to take the other course.\n\nPart 2: What is the probability that a student takes either Statistics or Psychology (or both)?\n\nWe use the addition rule of probability:\nP(Statistics \u222a Psychology) = P(Statistics) + P(Psychology) - P(Statistics \u2229 Psychology)\nP(Statistics \u222a Psychology) = 0.40 + 0.30 - 0.15 = 0.55\n\nTherefore, the probability that a randomly selected student takes either Statistics or Psychology (or both) is 0.55 or 55%."
