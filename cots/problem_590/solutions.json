If a student is selected at random from the college:\n\n1. Are the events 'student takes Statistics' and 'student takes Psychology' independent?\n2. What is the probability that a randomly selected student takes either Statistics or Psychology (or both)? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I've got this probability problem here about a small community college with two courses: Statistics and Psychology. The question has two parts. First, I need to determine if the events of a student taking Statistics and a student taking Psychology are independent. Second, I need to find the probability that a randomly selected student takes either Statistics or Psychology, or both. Let me try to work through this step by step.\n\nStarting with the first part: Are the events 'student takes Statistics' and 'student takes Psychology' independent? Hmm, okay, I remember that two events are independent if the probability of one event occurring doesn't affect the probability of the other. Mathematically, this is when the probability of both events happening together is equal to the product of their individual probabilities. So, the formula I think is:\n\n\\[ P(A \\text{ and } B) = P(A) \\times P(B) \\]\n\nIf this holds true, then the events are independent; otherwise, they're dependent.\n\nFrom the problem, we know that 40% of all students take Statistics, so:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{Statistics}) = 0.4 \\]\n\nAnd 30% take Psychology:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{Psychology}) = 0.3 \\]\n\nWe're also told that 15% of students take both courses. So,\n\n\\[ P(\\text{Both Statistics and Psychology}) = 0.15 \\]\n\nNow, let's plug these into the formula for independence. If the events were independent, then:\n\n\\[ P(\\text{Both}) = P(\\text{Statistics}) \\times P(\\text{Psychology}) \\]\n\nSo, let's calculate the right side:\n\n\\[ 0.4 \\times 0.3 = 0.12 \\]\n\nBut wait, the actual probability of both events happening is 0.15, which is higher than 0.12. Since 0.15 \u2260 0.12, this means that the events are not independent. Therefore, the answer to the first question is no, they are not independent.\n\nMoving on to the second part: What is the probability that a randomly selected student takes either Statistics or Psychology, or both?\n\nI think this is asking for the probability of either event A (takes Statistics) or event B (takes Psychology) happening. In probability terms, this is the union of two events, which can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \\cap B) \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( P(A) \\) is the probability of taking Statistics (0.4)\n- \\( P(B) \\) is the probability of taking Psychology (0.3)\n- \\( P(A \\cap B) \\) is the probability of taking both (0.15)\n\nPlugging these into the formula:\n\n\\[ P(A \\cup B) = 0.4 + 0.3 - 0.15 \\]\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n0.4 + 0.3 is 0.7, and subtracting 0.15 gives:\n\n0.7 - 0.15 = 0.55\n\nSo, the probability is 0.55, which is 55%.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. If 15% are taking both, then when we add the probabilities of each, we're counting those 15% twice. So subtracting them once gives the correct total probability for either one or the other or both. Yes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n1. The events are not independent because the joint probability is higher than the product of the individual probabilities.\n2. The probability of taking either course or both is 55%.\n\nI think that's it. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, but let me verify quickly.\n\nFor independence: 0.4 * 0.3 = 0.12 vs. actual 0.15. Since 0.15 > 0.12, not independent.\n\nFor the union: 0.4 + 0.3 = 0.7, minus 0.15 gives 0.55. Yep, that's correct.\n\nAlright, I'm confident with these answers.\n</think>\n\n1. **Independent Events Check:**  \n   The probability of both events occurring together (15%) is greater than the product of their individual probabilities (0.4 * 0.3 = 0.12). Since 0.15 \u2260 0.12, the events are **not independent**.\n\n2. **Probability of Taking Either Course or Both:**  \n   Using the formula for the union of two events:  \n   \\[ P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \\cap B) = 0.4 + 0.3 - 0.15 = 0.55 \\]  \n   So, the probability is 55%.\n\n**Answer:**  \n1. No, the events are not independent.  \n2. The probability is 55%.\n\nDONE."

Let me try to figure it out step by step. \n\nFirst, the problem says that 40% of all students take Statistics, 30% take Psychology, and 15% take both courses. There are two questions here. The first one is whether the events of a student taking Statistics and a student taking Psychology are independent. The second question is asking for the probability that a randomly selected student takes either Statistics or Psychology, or both.\n\nOkay, starting with the first question: Are the events independent? Hmm, I remember that in probability, two events are independent if the occurrence of one doesn't affect the probability of the other. The formula for independence is P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B). So, if the probability of both events happening is equal to the product of their individual probabilities, then they are independent. If not, they are dependent.\n\nIn this case, we know that 40% take Statistics (let's call that event S), 30% take Psychology (event P), and 15% take both (event S \u2229 P). So, let's plug these numbers into the formula to see if it holds.\n\nFirst, calculate P(S) * P(P). That's 0.4 * 0.3, which equals 0.12.\n\nNow, compare that to P(S \u2229 P), which is given as 15%, or 0.15.\n\nHmm, 0.12 is not equal to 0.15, so that means the events are not independent. So, the answer to the first question is no, they are dependent.\n\nAlright, moving on to the second question: What is the probability that a student takes either Statistics or Psychology or both? This sounds like a union of two events, so I think we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion here. The formula for the probability of A or B is P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B).\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers: P(S \u222a P) = P(S) + P(P) - P(S \u2229 P) = 0.4 + 0.3 - 0.15.\n\nLet me do that calculation: 0.4 + 0.3 is 0.7, and then subtract 0.15 gives 0.55. So, 55% probability.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. 40% plus 30% is 70%, but since 15% are taking both, we subtract that to avoid double-counting, so yes, 70% minus 15% is 55%. That makes sense.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the events are not independent, and the probability of a student taking either course is 55%.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n1. No, the events are not independent.  \n2. The probability is \\boxed{0.55}.  \nDONE.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the events of a student taking Statistics (S) and Psychology (P) are independent, we use the formula for independence: \\( P(S \\cap P) = P(S) \\times P(P) \\).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( P(S) = 0.4 \\)\n- \\( P(P) = 0.3 \\)\n- \\( P(S \\cap P) = 0.15 \\)\n\nCalculating \\( P(S) \\times P(P) \\):\n\\[ 0.4 \\times 0.3 = 0.12 \\]\n\nSince \\( 0.12 \\neq 0.15 \\), the events are not independent.\n\nNext, we calculate the probability that a student takes either Statistics or Psychology (or both) using the principle of inclusion-exclusion:\n\\[ P(S \\cup P) = P(S) + P(P) - P(S \\cap P) \\]\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\\[ P(S \\cup P) = 0.4 + 0.3 - 0.15 = 0.55 \\]\n\n### Final Answer\n\n1. No, the events are not independent.  \n2. The probability is \\boxed{0.55}.  \nDONE."

I remember that two events are independent if the probability of both happening is equal to the product of their individual probabilities. So, in formula terms, if P(A) is the probability of event A and P(B) is the probability of event B, then A and B are independent if P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B).\n\nGiven that 15% of students take both courses, that means P(A and B) is 15%. Let's write down what we know:\n\n- P(Statistics) = 40% or 0.4\n- P(Psychology) = 30% or 0.3\n- P(Both) = 15% or 0.15\n\nNow, let's check if P(Both) equals P(Statistics) * P(Psychology). \n\nCalculating 0.4 * 0.3 gives 0.12, which is 12%.

Let me double-check the numbers:\n\n40% + 30% = 70%, but since 15% are taking both, we subtract that once to avoid double-counting. So, 70% minus 15% is indeed 55%.

The probability of taking either course or both is 55%.\n\nI think that's it. Let me just recap to ensure I didn't overlook anything.\n\nFor independence, since the joint probability isn't equal to the product, they aren't independent. For the union probability, applying inclusion-exclusion gives me 55%. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\n**Final Answer**\n1. No, the events are not independent.  \n2.

What is the probability that a randomly selected student takes either Statistics or Psychology (or both)? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I've got this probability problem to solve. It's about a small community college that offers two courses: Statistics and Psychology. Let me try to break it down step by step. I need to figure out two things: first, whether the events of a student taking Statistics and a student taking Psychology are independent, and second, the probability that a randomly selected student takes either Statistics or Psychology or both.\n\nStarting with the first part: determining if the two events are independent. I remember from my probability class that two events are independent if the probability of both occurring is equal to the product of their individual probabilities. So, if I can calculate the joint probability of a student taking both courses and see if it equals the product of the probabilities of taking Statistics and Psychology separately, then I can conclude if they're independent.\n\nLet's note down the given information:\n\n- 40% of all students take Statistics. So, P(Statistics) = 0.4\n- 30% take Psychology. So, P(Psychology) = 0.3\n- 15% take both courses. So, P(Both) = 0.15\n\nNow, if I multiply the probabilities of taking Statistics and Psychology, I should get the joint probability if they were independent. Let's calculate that:\n\nP(Statistics) * P(Psychology) = 0.4 * 0.3 = 0.12\n\nBut wait, the joint probability given is 0.15, which is higher than 0.12. Hmm, that means the events aren't independent because the actual probability of both is higher than the product of their individual probabilities. So, they must be dependent.\n\nMoving on to the second part: the probability that a student takes either Statistics or Psychology or both. I think this is a classic case for using the principle of inclusion-exclusion. The formula for the probability of either event A or event B occurring is:\n\nP(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)\n\nPlugging in the values we have:\n\nP(Statistics or Psychology) = P(Statistics) + P(Psychology) - P(Both)\n= 0.4 + 0.3 - 0.15\n= 0.55\n\nSo, there's a 55% chance that a randomly selected student is taking either Statistics, Psychology, or both.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. For the first part, multiplying 0.4 and 0.3 gives 0.12, which is less than the 0.15 who take both. That definitely shows dependence. And for the second part, adding 0.4 and 0.3 gives 0.7, and subtracting 0.15 gives 0.55, which seems correct. Yeah, I think that's right.\n</think>\n\n1. **Are the events 'student takes Statistics' and 'student takes Psychology' independent?**  \n   To determine independence, we check if \\( P(\\text{Statistics and Psychology}) = P(\\text{Statistics}) \\times P(\\text{Psychology}) \\).  \n   Given:  \n   \\( P(\\text{Statistics}) = 0.4 \\)  \n   \\( P(\\text{Psychology}) = 0.3 \\)  \n   \\( P(\\text{Both}) = 0.15 \\)  \n   Calculate:  \n   \\( 0.4 \\times 0.3 = 0.12 \\)  \n   Since \\( 0.15 \\neq 0.12 \\), the events are **not independent**.\n\n2. **Probability of taking either Statistics or Psychology or both**  \n   Using inclusion-exclusion:  \n   \\( P(\\text{Either}) = P(\\text{Statistics}) + P(\\text{Psychology}) - P(\\text{Both}) \\)  \n   \\( = 0.4 + 0.3 - 0.15 = 0.55 \\)  \n   So, the probability is **0.55** or **55%**.\n\n**DONE.**"

What is the probability that a randomly selected student takes either Statistics or Psychology (or both)? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this problem about a small community college with two courses: Statistics and Psychology. The question gives me some percentages about how many students take each course and also how many take both. I need to figure out two things: first, whether the events of a student taking Statistics and Psychology are independent, and second, the probability that a randomly selected student takes either Statistics or Psychology, or both. Let me try to work through this step by step.\n\nOkay, starting with the first part: determining if taking Statistics and Psychology are independent events. I remember from my probability class that two events are independent if the occurrence of one doesn't affect the probability of the other. Mathematically, this means that the probability of both events happening together (P(A and B)) should equal the product of their individual probabilities (P(A) * P(B)). So, I need to find out if P(Statistics and Psychology) is equal to P(Statistics) * P(Psychology).\n\nThe problem states that 40% of all students take Statistics, which I can write as P(Statistics) = 0.4. Similarly, 30% take Psychology, so P(Psychology) = 0.3. It also says that 15% take both courses, so P(Statistics and Psychology) = 0.15. \n\nNow, to check independence, I'll multiply P(Statistics) by P(Psychology): 0.4 * 0.3. Let me calculate that: 0.4 times 0.3 is 0.12. \n\nSo, P(Statistics and Psychology) is 0.15, and P(Statistics) * P(Psychology) is 0.12. Since 0.15 is not equal to 0.12, the events are not independent. Therefore, taking Statistics and Psychology are dependent events.\n\nWait, let me think again. If 15% take both, that's higher than 0.4*0.3=0.12, which is 12%. So, more students are taking both than what we'd expect if they were independent. That makes sense why they're dependent. So, yeah, I think my initial conclusion is correct.\n\nMoving on to the second part: finding the probability that a randomly selected student takes either Statistics or Psychology or both. This sounds like a classic inclusion-exclusion problem. I remember the formula for the probability of A or B happening is P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B). \n\nSo, plugging in the numbers: P(Statistics or Psychology) = P(Statistics) + P(Psychology) - P(Statistics and Psychology). That would be 0.4 + 0.3 - 0.15. Let me do the math: 0.4 plus 0.3 is 0.7, and subtracting 0.15 gives me 0.55. So, the probability is 55%.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 40% take Stats, 30% take Psych, and 15% take both. If I just add 40% and 30%, that's 70%, but since 15% are counted twice in that addition, I need to subtract them once to get the correct probability of either one or the other. So, 70% minus 15% is indeed 55%. That makes sense.\n\nI wonder if there's another way to think about this. Maybe by visualizing a Venn diagram. If 40% are in the Stats circle and 30% are in the Psych circle, the overlap is 15%. So, the total area covered by either circle would be 40 + 30 - 15 = 55%, which matches my earlier calculation. That seems solid.\n\nIs there any chance I could have messed up the percentages? Let me double-check the numbers. 40% + 30% = 70%, and 70% - 15% = 55%. Yep, that's correct. So, I think I'm confident with that answer.\n\nIn summary, the two events aren't independent because their joint probability isn't the product of their individual probabilities. Instead, the probability of taking either course is 55%.\n</think>\n\n1. **Are the events 'student takes Statistics' and 'student takes Psychology' independent?**\n\n   To determine if the events are independent, we check if \\( P(\\text{Statistics and Psychology}) = P(\\text{Statistics}) \\times P(\\text{Psychology}) \\).\n\n   Given:\n   - \\( P(\\text{Statistics}) = 0.4 \\)\n   - \\( P(\\text{Psychology}) = 0.3 \\)\n   - \\( P(\\text{Statistics and Psychology}) = 0.15 \\)\n\n   Calculate \\( P(\\text{Statistics}) \\times P(\\text{Psychology}) = 0.4 \\times 0.3 = 0.12 \\).\n\n   Since \\( 0.15 \\neq 0.12 \\), the events are **not independent**.\n\n2. **Probability that a randomly selected student takes either Statistics or Psychology (or both):**\n\n   Use the inclusion-exclusion principle:\n   \\[\n   P(\\text{Statistics or Psychology}) = P(\\text{Statistics}) + P(\\text{Psychology}) - P(\\text{Statistics and Psychology})\n   \\]\n   Substitute the values:\n   \\[\n   P(\\text{Statistics or Psychology}) = 0.4 + 0.3 - 0.15 = 0.55\n   \\]\n\n   Therefore, the probability is **55%**.\n\nDONE."

What is the probability that a randomly selected student takes either Statistics or Psychology (or both)? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem about a small community college with two courses: Statistics and Psychology. The question gives me some percentages about how many students take each course and how many take both. I need to figure out two things: first, whether the events of a student taking Statistics and a student taking Psychology are independent, and second, the probability that a randomly selected student takes either Statistics or Psychology or both.\n\nAlright, let me start by recalling what independent events mean. If two events are independent, the probability of one occurring doesn't affect the probability of the other. Mathematically, two events A and B are independent if the probability of both occurring is equal to the product of their individual probabilities. In formula terms, that would be P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B). So, I need to check if this holds for the Statistics and Psychology courses.\n\nThe problem states that 40% of all students take Statistics, which I'll denote as P(A) = 0.4, and 30% take Psychology, denoted as P(B) = 0.3. It also mentions that 15% take both courses, so P(A and B) = 0.15.\n\nNow, if I multiply the probabilities of each individual event, P(A) * P(B) = 0.4 * 0.3. Let me calculate that: 0.4 times 0.3 is 0.12. So, P(A and B) is 0.15, which is greater than 0.12. That means that the probability of both events occurring together is higher than what we'd expect if they were independent. Therefore, this suggests that the events are not independent\u2014they are positively correlated. So, the answer to the first question is no, they are not independent.\n\nMoving on to the second part: finding the probability that a randomly selected student takes either Statistics or Psychology or both. This is a classic inclusion-exclusion principle problem. The formula for the probability of either event A or event B occurring is P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B). \n\nSo, plugging in the values we have: P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B) = 0.4 + 0.3 - 0.15. Let me do the math step by step. 0.4 plus 0.3 is 0.7, and then subtracting 0.15 gives me 0.55. So, 55% of the students take either Statistics or Psychology or both.\n\nLet me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. For the first part, independent events require P(A and B) = P(A)*P(B). We had P(A and B) = 0.15 and P(A)*P(B) = 0.12, so they aren't equal, meaning they aren't independent. That seems right.\n\nFor the second part, using inclusion-exclusion: 0.4 + 0.3 is indeed 0.7, and subtracting 0.15 gives 0.55. Yep, that checks out. So, I think I've got both parts figured out.\n</think>\n\n1. **Are the events 'student takes Statistics' and 'student takes Psychology' independent?**\n\nTo determine if the events are independent, we check if \\( P(A \\cap B) = P(A) \\times P(B) \\).\n\n- \\( P(A) = 0.4 \\)\n- \\( P(B) = 0.3 \\)\n- \\( P(A \\cap B) = 0.15 \\)\n- \\( P(A) \\times P(B) = 0.4 \\times 0.3 = 0.12 \\)\n\nSince \\( 0.15 \\neq 0.12 \\), the events are **not independent**.\n\n2. **Probability that a randomly selected student takes either Statistics or Psychology (or both):**\n\nUsing the inclusion-exclusion principle:\n\n\\( P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \\cap B) \\)\n\n- \\( P(A \\cup B) = 0.4 + 0.3 - 0.15 = 0.55 \\)\n\nThus, the probability is **55%**.\n\n**DONE.**"

If a student is selected at random from the college:\n\n1. Are the events 'student takes Statistics' and 'student takes Psychology' independent?\n2. What is the probability that a randomly selected student takes either Statistics or Psychology (or both)? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this problem about a community college with two courses: Statistics and Psychology. I need to figure out two things. First, whether the events of a student taking Statistics and a student taking Psychology are independent. Second, I have to find the probability that a randomly selected student takes either Statistics or Psychology, or both.\n\nLet me start with the first question: Are the events independent?\n\nI remember that in probability, two events are independent if the probability of one event happening doesn't affect the probability of the other event happening. Mathematically, this means that P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B). So, I need to check if the probability of a student taking both courses is equal to the product of the probabilities of taking Statistics and Psychology individually.\n\nGiven:\n- 40% of all students take Statistics. So, P(Statistics) = 0.4.\n- 30% take Psychology. So, P(Psychology) = 0.3.\n- 15% take both courses. So, P(Both) = 0.15.\n\nNow, let's multiply P(Statistics) and P(Psychology): 0.4 * 0.3 = 0.12.\n\nWait a minute, that's 0.12, which is 12%, but the probability of taking both is 15%. So, 0.15 is not equal to 0.12. That means the events are not independent because the probability of both isn't equal to the product of their individual probabilities.\n\nSo, the answer to the first question is no, they are not independent.\n\nMoving on to the second question: What's the probability that a student takes either Statistics or Psychology, or both?\n\nI think this is asking for the probability of the union of the two events, which is P(Statistics or Psychology). The formula for the union of two events is P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B). So, applying that here:\n\nP(Statistics or Psychology) = P(Statistics) + P(Psychology) - P(Both).\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nP(Statistics or Psychology) = 0.4 + 0.3 - 0.15.\n\nLet me do the math: 0.4 + 0.3 is 0.7, and 0.7 - 0.15 is 0.55.\n\nSo, the probability is 55%.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. If 40% take Stats, 30% take Psych, and 15% take both, then adding them would count the both group twice. So, subtracting once gives the correct total. Yes, 0.4 + 0.3 is 0.7, minus 0.15 gives 0.55 or 55%.\n\nAlright, that makes sense. So, summarizing:\n\n1. The events are not independent because P(Both) \u2260 P(Stats) * P(Psych).\n2. The probability of taking either course or both is 55%.\n\nI think that's all for this problem. I hope I didn't make any calculation mistakes.\n</think>\n\n1. The events are not independent because the probability of taking both courses (15%) is not equal to the product of the individual probabilities (40% * 30% = 12%).\n\n2. The probability that a student takes either Statistics or Psychology (or both) is 55%.\n\nDONE."

If a student is selected at random from the college:\n\n1. Are the events 'student takes Statistics' and 'student takes Psychology' independent?\n2. What is the probability that a randomly selected student takes either Statistics or Psychology (or both)? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this probability problem to solve, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and understand what it's asking.\n\nThe problem says: A small community college has two courses: Statistics and Psychology. 40% of all students take Statistics, 30% take Psychology, and 15% take both courses. If a student is selected at random from the college:\n\n1. Are the events 'student takes Statistics' and 'student takes Psychology' independent?\n2. What is the probability that a randomly selected student takes either Statistics or Psychology (or both)?\n\nOkay, so there are two parts to this problem. The first part asks whether the two events\u2014taking Statistics and taking Psychology\u2014are independent. The second part asks for the probability that a student takes either one or both courses.\n\nLet me start with the first question. To determine if two events are independent, I remember that in probability, two events A and B are independent if the probability of both occurring is equal to the product of their individual probabilities. In mathematical terms, that means P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B). If that's not the case, then the events are dependent.\n\nSo, let's note down the given probabilities:\n\n- P(Statistics) = 40% = 0.4\n- P(Psychology) = 30% = 0.3\n- P(Both Statistics and Psychology) = 15% = 0.15\n\nNow, if I multiply P(Statistics) and P(Psychology), that should give me P(Statistics and Psychology) if they were independent. Let me calculate that:\n\nP(Statistics) * P(Psychology) = 0.4 * 0.3 = 0.12\n\nBut wait, the problem says that 15% of students take both courses, which is 0.15. Comparing that to 0.12, they are not equal. So, does that mean the events are dependent?\n\nYes, because the probability of both events occurring is not equal to the product of their individual probabilities. Therefore, the events are dependent, not independent.\n\nHmm, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Sometimes, I get confused with conditional probabilities. Maybe I should think in terms of conditional probability to double-check.\n\nConditional probability formula is P(B|A) = P(A and B) / P(A)\n\nSo, if I fix the event A as taking Statistics, then the probability of taking Psychology given that they take Statistics is P(Psychology|Statistics) = 0.15 / 0.4 = 0.375\n\nSimilarly, if I fix Psychology as event A, then P(Statistics|Psychology) = 0.15 / 0.3 = 0.5\n\nSince these conditional probabilities (0.375 and 0.5) are not equal to the original probabilities of Psychology (0.3) and Statistics (0.4), it confirms that the events are not independent. Therefore, the answer to the first question is no, they are not independent.\n\nMoving on to the second part: What is the probability that a randomly selected student takes either Statistics or Psychology or both?\n\nI remember that in probability, the probability of A or B occurring is given by P(A \u222a B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \u2229 B). This formula accounts for the overlap where both events happen, so we don't double-count it.\n\nSo, plugging in the values:\n\nP(Statistics or Psychology) = P(Statistics) + P(Psychology) - P(Both)\n= 0.4 + 0.3 - 0.15\n= 0.55\n\nSo, the probability is 55%.\n\nWait, let me think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using Venn diagrams? If 40% take Statistics and 30% take Psychology, with 15% taking both, then the unique part of Statistics is 40% - 15% = 25%, and the unique part of Psychology is 30% - 15% = 15%. So, adding those together with the both part: 25% + 15% + 15% = 55%, which matches the previous calculation. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I think in terms of percentages, 40% take Stats, 30% take Psych. But some are in both. So, if I just add 40% and 30%, that's 70%, but that counts the 15% twice, so I need to subtract 15% once to get the correct total. So, 70% - 15% = 55%. Yep, that checks out.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the probability of a student taking either Statistics or Psychology or both is 55%.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n1. The events are not independent because P(Both) \u2260 P(Stats) * P(Psych).\n2. The probability of taking either course is 55%.\n\nI think that's it. Let me just write down the key steps again to make sure I didn't skip anything.\n\nFor independence:\n- P(Stats) = 0.4\n- P(Psych) = 0.3\n- P(Both) = 0.15\n- P(Stats) * P(Psych) = 0.12 \u2260 0.15 \u2192 Not independent.\n\nFor the union probability:\n- P(Stats \u222a Psych) = 0.4 + 0.3 - 0.15 = 0.55.\n\nYep, looks solid.\nDONE.\n</think>\n\n1. The events are not independent because P(Both) \u2260 P(Stats) * P(Psych).\n\n2. The probability that a randomly selected student takes either Statistics or Psychology (or both) is 55%.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n1. No, the events are not independent.\n\n2. The probability is 55%.\n\nDONE."

What is the probability that a randomly selected student takes either Statistics or Psychology (or both)? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I've got this problem about a small community college with two courses: Statistics and Psychology. The question has two parts. First, I need to determine if the events of a student taking Statistics and a student taking Psychology are independent. Second, I have to find the probability that a randomly selected student takes either Statistics or Psychology, or both. Okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nStarting with the first part: Are the events independent? I remember that two events are independent if the probability of one event occurring doesn't affect the probability of the other event occurring. Mathematically, this means that the probability of both events happening together (P(A and B)) should equal the product of their individual probabilities (P(A) * P(B)). So, if I can calculate P(Statistics and Psychology) and see if it equals P(Statistics) * P(Psychology), then I can determine independence.\n\nFrom the problem, I know that 40% of all students take Statistics, which is P(Statistics) = 0.4, and 30% take Psychology, so P(Psychology) = 0.3. It also says that 15% take both courses, so P(Statistics and Psychology) = 0.15.\n\nTo check for independence, I'll multiply the probabilities of each event: 0.4 * 0.3 = 0.12. Now, comparing that to the probability of both events happening, which is 0.15. Since 0.15 is not equal to 0.12, the events are not independent. Therefore, taking Statistics and Psychology are dependent events.\n\nMoving on to the second part: What's the probability that a student takes either Statistics or Psychology, or both? This sounds like a classic inclusion-exclusion principle problem. The formula for the probability of either event A or event B happening is P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B). This adjustment subtracts the overlap because if we just add P(A) and P(B), we're double-counting those who take both.\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers: P(Statistics or Psychology) = P(Statistics) + P(Psychology) - P(Statistics and Psychology) = 0.4 + 0.3 - 0.15. Let me do the math: 0.4 plus 0.3 is 0.7, and subtracting 0.15 gives 0.55. So, the probability is 55%.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. If 40% take Stats and 30% take Psych, with 15% overlapping, then the unique students in each would be 40% - 15% = 25% for Stats, and 30% - 15% = 15% for Psych. So, 25% + 15% + 15% = 55%. Yep, that matches. So, that seems correct.\n\nPutting it all together, the events are not independent, and the probability of taking either course or both is 55%.\n</think>\n\n1. **Independent Events Check**:  \n   To determine if the events are independent, we check if \\( P(A \\text{ and } B) = P(A) \\times P(B) \\).  \n   Here, \\( P(A) = 0.4 \\), \\( P(B) = 0.3 \\), and \\( P(A \\text{ and } B) = 0.15 \\).  \n   Calculating \\( P(A) \\times P(B) = 0.4 \\times 0.3 = 0.12 \\).  \n   Since \\( 0.15 \\neq 0.12 \\), the events are **not independent**.\n\n2. **Probability of Either Event**:  \n   Using the inclusion-exclusion principle:  \n   \\( P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \\text{ and } B) \\).  \n   Substituting the values:  \n   \\( P(A \\cup B) = 0.4 + 0.3 - 0.15 = 0.55 \\).  \n   Therefore, the probability is **55%**.\n\n**Answer:**  \n1.

What is the probability that a randomly selected student takes either Statistics or Psychology (or both)? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this problem about a small community college with two courses: Statistics and Psychology. The question is asking two things. First, whether the events of a student taking Statistics and a student taking Psychology are independent. Second, it wants the probability that a randomly selected student takes either Statistics or Psychology or both. Hmm, okay, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the given information. It says 40% of all students take Statistics, 30% take Psychology, and 15% take both courses. I think this is important because it tells me about the overlap between the two courses. So, 40% take Stats, 30% take Psych, and 15% are taking both. \n\nNow, the first question is whether these two events are independent. I remember from my probability class that two events are independent if the occurrence of one doesn't affect the probability of the other. Mathematically, this means that the probability of both events happening is equal to the product of their individual probabilities. So, P(Stats and Psych) = P(Stats) * P(Psych). If that's true, then they are independent; otherwise, they're dependent.\n\nGiven that 15% take both courses, that's P(Stats and Psych) = 15%. Now, P(Stats) is 40%, and P(Psych) is 30%. If I multiply 40% by 30%, what do I get? Let me calculate that: 0.4 * 0.3 = 0.12, which is 12%. But wait, the actual probability of both is 15%, not 12%. That means that the two events are not independent because the product of their probabilities doesn't equal the probability of both happening. So, the events are dependent.\n\nOkay, that answers the first part. Now, moving on to the second question: the probability that a student takes either Statistics or Psychology or both. Hmm, this sounds like a classic union probability problem. I think the formula for the probability of A or B (or both) is P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B). So, that would be P(Stats) + P(Psych) - P(Stats and Psych). Let me plug in the numbers: 40% + 30% - 15% = 55%. So, 55% is the probability that a student takes either Statistics or Psychology or both.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, if 40% take Stats, 30% take Psych, but 15% are taking both, then when I add 40% and 30%, I'm counting the 15% twice. So, subtracting 15% once gives me the correct total. Yeah, that makes sense because without subtracting, the total would be overcounted. So, 40 + 30 is 70, minus 15 is 55. So, 55% is the right probability.\n\nTo summarize, the events are not independent because the joint probability isn't equal to the product of the individual probabilities. Instead, the probability of taking either course or both is 55%. I think that's all there is to it. Let me just make sure I didn't miss anything in the problem statement.\n\nThe problem mentions a small community college with two courses: Statistics and Psychology. It gives the percentages for each course and the overlap. I used these percentages correctly in both parts of the question. For independence, I checked if P(A and B) equals P(A)*P(B), which it doesn't, so they're dependent. For the union, I used the inclusion-exclusion principle, which gave me 55%. I don't see any errors in my calculations or reasoning.\n\nSo, I'm confident with these answers. First, the events are not independent, and the probability of taking either course is 55%.\n</think>\n\n1. The events are **not independent** because P(Stats and Psych) \u2260 P(Stats) * P(Psych).  \n2. The probability that a student takes either Statistics or Psychology (or both) is 55%.\n\nDONE."
