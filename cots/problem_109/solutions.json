End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: You are faced with two investment options for your $10,000 savings:\n\nOption A: A conservative bond with a guaranteed 3% annual return.\n\nOption B: A stock investment with a 60% chance of earning an 8% annual return and a 40% chance of losing 5% of your investment.\n\nIf you want to maximize your expected return after one year, which option should you choose and why? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I've got this investment problem to solve. I have $10,000 to invest, and I need to decide between two options: Option A and Option B. The goal is to maximize my expected return after one year. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at Option A. It's a conservative bond with a guaranteed 3% annual return. That sounds pretty safe, right? No risks involved because it's a guarantee. So, if I invest $10,000, after one year, I'll get back 3% of that amount. Let me calculate that real quick. 3% of $10,000 is 0.03 * 10,000, which is $300. So, my total would be $10,000 + $300 = $10,300. Easy enough.\n\nNow, onto Option B. This one is a bit more complicated because it involves some probability. It's a stock investment with a 60% chance of earning an 8% annual return and a 40% chance of losing 5% of my investment. Hmm, okay, so there are two possible outcomes here: one where I make money and another where I lose money. I need to calculate the expected return for Option B to see how it stacks up against Option A.\n\nFirst, let's figure out what 8% of $10,000 is. 0.08 * 10,000 equals $800. So, if I earn 8%, I'll have $10,000 + $800 = $10,800. On the flip side, if I lose 5%, that's 0.05 * 10,000 = $500. So, in that case, I'll have $10,000 - $500 = $9,500.\n\nNow, since there's a 60% chance of earning 8%, that scenario will happen 0.6 times out of 1. Similarly, the 40% chance of losing 5% means that scenario will occur 0.4 times. To find the expected return, I need to multiply each outcome by its probability and then sum them up.\n\nSo, the expected return from the winning outcome is 0.6 * 800, which is $480. The expected return from the losing outcome is 0.4 * (-500), which is -200. Adding those together gives me the total expected return: $480 - $200 = $280.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. 0.6 times 800 is indeed 480, and 0.4 times -500 is -200. Yes, that adds up to a total expected return of $280. So, on average, Option B is expected to give me back $280, which when added to my original $10,000, would give me $10,280.\n\nComparing that to Option A, which gives me $10,300, it seems like Option A has a higher expected return. But hold on, let me make sure I'm not missing anything here. Is there a different way to look at Option B? Maybe considering the total expected value differently?\n\nAnother way to think about it is to calculate the expected value of the investment after one year. The expected value formula is:\n\nExpected Value = (Probability of Gain * Gain) + (Probability of Loss * Loss)\n\nSo plugging in the numbers:\n\nExpected Value = (0.6 * 800) + (0.4 * (-500)) = 480 - 200 = $280\n\nSo, the expected value added to the principal is $280, making the total $10,280. Comparing that to Option A's $10,300, Option A is better.\n\nBut wait, is there a chance that the expected return from Option B could be higher? Maybe if I consider the percentage returns instead of absolute values? Let's see.\n\nOption A gives a 3% return on $10,000, which is $300. Option B has a 60% chance of an 8% return and a 40% chance of a 5% loss. So, the expected percentage return for Option B is:\n\nExpected Percentage Return = (0.6 * 8%) + (0.4 * (-5%)) = 4.8% - 2% = 2.8%\n\nSo, the expected percentage return for Option B is 2.8%, whereas Option A is 3%. Therefore, Option A still has a higher expected return percentage.\n\nWait, but in absolute terms, Option B's expected return is $280, and Option A is $300. So, Option A is better in absolute terms too. So, even when considering percentages, Option A is better.\n\nIs there anything else I need to consider? Maybe the time value of money, but since we're only looking at returns after one year, that shouldn't affect the comparison. Also, are there any transaction costs or fees? The problem doesn't mention any, so I can ignore that.\n\nAnother thought: sometimes in investments, people consider the risk. Option A is risk-free, while Option B has a 40% chance of losing money. So, from a risk perspective, Option A is safer. But since the question is about maximizing expected return, not minimizing risk, Option A is still the better choice.\n\nSo, putting it all together, Option A offers a guaranteed 3% return, which results in $10,300 after one year, whereas Option B has an expected return of $280, leading to $10,280. Therefore, Option A is the better choice for maximizing expected return.\n\nI think that's all. I've considered both options, calculated the expected returns, and compared them. No other factors seem to influence the decision in this case. So, I'm confident that Option A is the right choice.\n</think>\n\nAfter carefully analyzing both investment options, Option A provides a guaranteed 3% return, resulting in $10,300 after one year. Option B, while offering a higher potential return of 8%, has a 40% chance of a 5% loss, leading to an expected return of $280, which is less than Option A's $300. Therefore, Option A is the optimal choice for maximizing expected return.\n\n**Answer:** Choose Option A because it offers a guaranteed 3% annual return, resulting in $10,300 after one year, which is higher than the expected $10,280 from Option B.

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem presents two investment options for my $10,000 savings. My goal is to maximize my expected return after one year. I need to figure out which option\u2014A or B\u2014is better based on this criterion.\n\nOption A is a conservative bond with a guaranteed 3% annual return. That sounds pretty straightforward. Since it's a bond, it's generally considered less risky, and the return is fixed. So, no matter what happens, I'll get 3% of my investment back each year. That's a nice, safe option, but maybe not the most exciting if I'm looking for higher returns.\n\nOption B is a stock investment with a bit more uncertainty. It has a 60% chance of earning an 8% annual return and a 40% chance of losing 5% of my investment. This means there's a 60% likelihood of a significant gain and a 40% chance of a slight loss. It's riskier, but it could potentially offer higher returns if I'm lucky. However, with a 40% chance of losing money, I need to weigh the potential gains against the possible losses.\n\nSince the question is about maximizing the expected return, I should focus on calculating the expected value for both options and then compare them. The expected value is essentially the average outcome if I were to repeat the investment many times, considering the probabilities and returns for each scenario.\n\nLet's start with Option A because it's straightforward. The guaranteed return is 3%, so regardless of anything else, I can calculate the expected return easily.\n\nFor Option A:\n- The investment is $10,000.\n- The return is 3% annually.\n\nSo, the expected return from Option A is 3% of $10,000.\n\nExpected Return A = 3% * $10,000 = $300.\n\nThat's pretty simple. I know exactly what I'll get from Option A.\n\nNow, moving on to Option B. This one is trickier because it has two possible outcomes with different probabilities and returns. I need to calculate the expected return by considering both the potential gain and the potential loss.\n\nFor Option B:\n- Probability of earning 8%: 60% or 0.6\n- Probability of losing 5%: 40% or 0.4\n- Investment amount: $10,000\n\nFirst, I'll calculate the return for each outcome.\n\nIf I earn 8%, the return is:\n8% of $10,000 = $800.\n\nIf I lose 5%, the loss is:\n5% of $10,000 = $500.\n\nBut wait, a 5% loss on $10,000 is $500, so my investment would go down to $9,500.\n\nNow, to find the expected return, I need to multiply each outcome by its respective probability and then sum them up.\n\nExpected Return B = (Probability of 8% return * 8%) + (Probability of -5% return * (-5%))\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\nExpected Return B = (0.6 * 8%) + (0.4 * (-5%))\n\nCalculating each part:\n0.6 * 8% = 4.8%\n0.4 * (-5%) = -2%\n\nAdding them together:\n4.8% + (-2%) = 2.8%\n\nSo, the expected return from Option B is 2.8%.\n\nComparing the two options:\n- Option A gives me an expected return of $300.\n- Option B gives me an expected return of 2.8% of $10,000, which is $280.\n\nTherefore, Option A has a higher expected return than Option B. The guaranteed 3% return is better than the 2.8% expected return from the stock investment, even though the stock has the potential for a higher return in some cases.\n\nHowever, it's important to consider risk here. Option A is risk-free, while Option B has a 40% chance of losing money. If I'm risk-averse, Option A would be the better choice. But if I'm willing to take on more risk for the potential of higher returns, I might consider Option B. Yet, based solely on expected return, Option A is superior.\n\nJust to double-check my calculations, I'll go through them again.\n\nFor Option A:\n3% of $10,000 is indeed $300. No issues there.\n\nFor Option B:\n- 60% of the time, I make 8%, which is $800. 0.6 * $800 = $480 in expected value from gains.\n- 40% of the time, I lose 5%, which is $500. 0.4 * $500 = $200 in expected value from losses.\n- Total expected return: $480 - $200 = $280.\n\nYes, that matches my previous calculation. So, Option B's expected return is $280, which is less than Option A's $300.\n\nTherefore, even though Option B has the potential for a higher return, its expected value is lower, making Option A the better choice for maximizing expected return.\n</think>\n\nAfter analyzing both investment options, Option A provides a higher expected return of $300 compared to Option B's $280. Therefore, the optimal choice is:\n\n**Option A**\n\nDONE."

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I have $10,000 to invest. There are two options: Option A and Option B. I need to understand what each option entails and calculate their expected returns.\n\nStarting with Option A: It's a conservative bond with a guaranteed 3% annual return. That sounds straightforward. So, regardless of what happens, I will get 3% of my investment back each year. To calculate the return, I can multiply 3% by $10,000. \n\nSo, 3% of $10,000 is 0.03 * 10,000 = $300. Therefore, Option A gives me a guaranteed $300 return after one year.\n\nNow, moving on to Option B: This is a stock investment with a 60% chance of earning an 8% annual return and a 40% chance of losing 5% of my investment. This is a bit more complex because it involves probabilities and potential losses.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the expected return for Option B. Expected return is like the average outcome if I were to repeat the investment many times. So, it's calculated by multiplying each possible outcome by its probability and then summing those products.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. **Earning 8% of $10,000:** There's a 60% chance of this happening. So, the amount earned in this scenario is 8% of $10,000.\n   - 8% of $10,000 is 0.08 * 10,000 = $800.\n\n2. **Losing 5% of $10,000:** There's a 40% chance of this happening. Losing 5% means I lose $500 because 5% of $10,000 is 0.05 * 10,000 = $500.\n\nNow, to find the expected return, I need to multiply each outcome by its probability and add them together.\n\nSo, Expected Return = (Probability of 8% gain * 8% gain) + (Probability of 5% loss * 5% loss)\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nExpected Return = (0.60 * $800) + (0.40 * -$500)\n\nLet's compute each part:\n\n- 0.60 * $800 = $480\n- 0.40 * -$500 = -$200\n\nAdding them together: $480 + (-$200) = $280\n\nSo, the expected return for Option B is $280.\n\nComparing both options:\n\n- Option A: $300\n- Option B: $280\n\nEven though Option B has the potential for higher returns (if it earns 8%), on average, it doesn't beat Option A. The 60% chance of earning 8% and 40% chance of losing 5% bring the expected return down to $280, which is less than the guaranteed $300 from Option A.\n\nTherefore, Option A is better because it guarantees a higher return with no risk of loss, while Option B, although it has the potential for higher returns, has a higher chance of resulting in a lower return due to the 5% loss probability.\n\nSo, after analyzing both options, I should choose Option A to maximize my expected return after one year.\n</think>\n\nAfter evaluating both investment options, Option A provides a guaranteed return of $300, while Option B has an expected return of $280. Therefore, Option A is the better choice for maximizing expected return.\n\n**Answer:** Choose Option A because it offers a guaranteed 3% return, resulting in $300, which is higher than Option B's expected return of $280.\n\nDONE."

I have $10,000 that I can invest in one of two options, and I need to figure out which one will give me a better expected return after one year. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand what each option entails.\n\n**Option A:** It's a conservative bond with a guaranteed 3% annual return. That means no matter what happens, I'll get 3% of my investment back each year. So, for $10,000, that would be 3% of 10,000.

No risks involved here since it's guaranteed.\n\n**Option B:** This one is a bit riskier. It's a stock investment with two possible outcomes: a 60% chance of earning an 8% annual return and a 40% chance of losing 5% of my investment. Hmm, so there's a 60% chance I make 8%, and a 40% chance I lose 5%.\n\nLet me figure out what each outcome would be in terms of dollar amounts. Starting with the 8% gain.\n\n8% of $10,000 is 0.08 * 10,000 = $800. So, if I earn 8%, I'll have $10,000 + $800 = $10,800.\n\nNow, the other outcome is losing 5%. 5% of $10,000 is 0.05 * 10,000 = $500. So, if I lose 5%, I'll have $10,000 - $500 = $9,500.\n\nAlright, so Option B could lead to either $10,800 with 60% probability or $9,500 with 40% probability.\n\nNow, to find the expected return for Option B, I need to calculate the weighted average of these two outcomes. That means multiplying each outcome by its probability and then adding them together.\n\nLet me do that:\n\nExpected return = (Probability of 8% gain * 8%) + (Probability of 5% loss * (-5%))\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nExpected return = (0.60 * 8%) + (0.40 * (-5%))\n\nCalculating each part:\n\n0.60 * 8% = 4.8%\n0.40 * (-5%) = -2%\n\nAdding them together: 4.8% - 2% = 2.8%\n\nWait a minute, so the expected return for Option B is 2.8%? That's actually lower than Option A, which gives a guaranteed 3% return.\n\nSo, even though Option B has the potential for a higher return (8%) in some cases, the chance of losing money brings the expected return down to 2.8%. That's less than what I can get with Option A, which is risk-free.\n\nTherefore, Option A seems like the better choice because it guarantees a 3% return, whereas Option B, despite its potential for higher returns, doesn't consistently outperform due to the risk involved.\n\nI should double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's recalculate the expected return for Option B.\n\n0.60 * 8% = 4.8%\n0.40 * (-5%) = -2%\nTotal expected return = 4.8% - 2% = 2.8%\n\nYep, that's correct. So, the expected return for Option B is indeed 2.8%, which is less than 3%. That means, on average, Option A is better.\n\nI guess sometimes even though the potential for higher returns exists, the risk involved can lower the expected return. So, in this case, the guaranteed 3% is more attractive because it doesn't come with the risk of a potential loss.\n\nSo, after considering both options, I think Option A is the way to go because it offers a higher expected return with no risk, whereas Option B, despite its higher potential, doesn't consistently deliver a better return due to the risk of loss.\n</think>\n\nAfter evaluating both investment options, Option A is the better choice because it provides a guaranteed 3% annual return with no risk, whereas Option B has a lower expected return of 2.8% due to the risk of a 5% loss. \n\n**Answer:** Choose Option A because it offers a guaranteed 3% return, resulting in an expected $300 gain, which is higher than the 2.8% expected return of Option B. \n\nDONE."

Let me start by understanding both options clearly.\n\nFirst, Option A is a conservative bond that guarantees a 3% annual return. That means no matter what happens, I'll get back 3% of my investment after one year. Since I'm investing $10,000, the return would be 3% of $10,000, which is $300. So, my final amount after one year would be $10,000 + $300 = $10,300. That's straightforward because it's a guaranteed return.\n\nNow, Option B is a bit more complicated. It's a stock investment with two possible outcomes: a 60% chance of earning an 8% annual return and a 40% chance of losing 5% of my investment. Let me break this down. \n\nIf I take the 8% return, that would be 8% of $10,000, which is $800. So, my final amount in this case would be $10,000 + $800 = $10,800. \n\nOn the flip side, if there's a loss of 5%, that would be 5% of $10,000, which is $500. So, in this scenario, my investment would decrease by $500, making my final amount $10,000 - $500 = $9,500.\n\nNow, to find the expected return for Option B, I need to consider the probabilities of each outcome. The expected return is calculated by multiplying each outcome's value by its probability and then summing them up. \n\nSo, the expected return from the winning scenario is 60% * 8% = 0.6 * 0.08 = 0.048, or 4.8%. \n\nThe expected return from the losing scenario is 40% * (-5%) = 0.4 * (-0.05) = -0.02, or -2%. \n\nAdding these together, the total expected return is 4.8% + (-2%) = 2.8%. \n\nTherefore, the expected return for Option B is 2.8%, which is higher than the guaranteed 3% from Option A? Wait, that doesn't make sense because 2.8% is less than 3%. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in my calculation.\n\nLet me double-check. \n\n60% chance of 8%: 0.6 * 0.08 = 0.048 or 4.8%.\n\n40% chance of -5%: 0.4 * (-0.05) = -0.02 or -2%.\n\nAdding them: 4.8% - 2% = 2.8%. Yeah, that's correct. So the expected return is 2.8%, which is actually lower than Option A's 3%. \n\nWait, that's odd. So even though there's a chance of a higher return with Option B, the expected return is lower than the guaranteed 3% from Option A. That means, on average, Option A gives me a better return. \n\nBut why is that? Because while Option B has the potential for a higher return, it also has a significant chance of a loss, which brings down the expected value. So, even though 8% is higher than 3%, the 40% chance of losing 5% drags the average down below the guaranteed 3%.\n\nSo, after calculating, Option A actually has a higher expected return than Option B. Therefore, if I want to maximize my expected return after one year, I should choose Option A because it guarantees a higher return on average compared to Option B.\n</think>\n\nAfter evaluating both investment options, Option A provides a guaranteed 3% return, resulting in an expected return of $300, whereas Option B has an expected return of 2.8%. Therefore, Option A is better for maximizing expected return.\n\n**Answer:** Choose Option A because it offers a higher guaranteed expected return compared to Option B. DONE."

There are two options given:\n\n**Option A:** A conservative bond that guarantees a 3% annual return.\n\n**Option B:** A stock investment where there's a 60% chance of earning an 8% annual return and a 40% chance of losing 5% of my investment.\n\nMy goal is to choose the option that gives me the highest expected return after one year.

This one is a bit riskier because it's a stock investment with two possible outcomes: either an 8% return or a 5% loss. The probabilities are 60% for the 8% return and 40% for the 5% loss.\n\nTo find the expected return for Option B, I need to calculate the weighted average of the two possible returns. That means I multiply each return by its probability and then add them together.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nExpected Return (Option B) = (Probability of 8% return * 8%) + (Probability of 5% loss * 5%)\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n= (0.60 * 0.08) + (0.40 * 0.05)\n\nFirst, I'll calculate each part separately.\n\n0.60 * 0.08 = 0.048\n\n0.40 * 0.05 = 0.020\n\nNow, adding those together:\n\n0.048 + 0.020 = 0.068\n\nSo, the expected return for Option B is 0.068, which is 6.8%.\n\nWait, let me double-check that because 6.8% seems a bit low given that the higher return is 8%. Hmm, but the higher return only happens 60% of the time, and the loss happens 40% of the time, which is significant. So, the loss drags the expected return down.\n\nNow, comparing the two options:\n\n- Option A: 3% guaranteed return.\n- Option B: 6.8% expected return.\n\nSince 6.8% is higher than 3%, Option B has a higher expected return. Therefore, even though there's a risk of losing money, the higher expected return makes Option B the better choice for maximizing my expected return.\n\nBut wait, I should also consider the risk aspect. Option A is guaranteed, so I don't have to worry about losing money, but the return is lower. Option B has higher potential returns but also the risk of loss. However, the question specifically asks about maximizing the expected return, not about minimizing risk. So, even though there's risk, the higher expected return is more important here.\n\nLet me summarize:\n\n- **Option A:** 3% return with certainty.\n- **Option B:** 6.8% expected return with a 40% chance of a 5% loss.\n\nSo, Option B is better because 6.8% is higher than 3%. Even though there's a chance of losing 5%, the higher expected return outweighs the guaranteed return in this case.\n\nI think that's it. Option B gives a higher expected return, so I should choose that.\n</think>\n\nTo determine which investment option maximizes the expected return, we calculate the expected return for both options.\n\n**Option A:**\n- **Return:** 3% (guaranteed)\n- **Expected Return:** 3%\n\n**Option B:**\n- **Possible Returns:**\n  - 8% with 60% probability\n  - -5% (loss) with 40% probability\n- **Expected Return Calculation:**\n  - (0.60 * 8%) + (0.40 * -5%) = 0.048 - 0.02 = 0.028 or 2.8%\n\nWait, that doesn't align with my previous calculation. Let me recheck.\n\nAh, I see a mistake. I incorrectly added the results before. Let me correct it.\n\n**Correct Calculation for Option B:**\n- (0.60 * 8%) = 4.8%\n- (0.40 * -5%) = -2%\n- Total Expected Return = 4.8% - 2% = 2.8%\n\nSo, Option B's expected return is 2.8%, which is lower than Option A's 3%. Therefore, Option A is better for maximizing the expected return.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nChoose Option A because it guarantees a 3% return, which is higher than the 2.8% expected return of Option B.\n\nDONE."

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each option offers. \n\n**Option A** is a conservative bond that guarantees a 3% annual return. That means no matter what happens, I'll get back 3% of my investment. Since I'm investing $10,000, my return would be $10,000 * 0.03 = $300. So, my total after one year would be $10,300. It's safe and predictable.\n\n**Option B** is a bit riskier. It's a stock investment with two possible outcomes: a 60% chance of earning an 8% return and a 40% chance of losing 5%. Let me calculate the expected return for this option.\n\nFirst, I'll find out the two possible returns:\n\n- If I earn 8%, my return would be $10,000 * 0.08 = $800.\n- If I lose 5%, my return would be $10,000 * (-0.05) = -$500.\n\nNow, since there's a 60% chance of earning $800 and a 40% chance of losing $500, I can calculate the expected return by multiplying each outcome by its probability and then adding them together.\n\nSo, the expected return (E) is:\n\nE = (Probability of 8% return * 8% return) + (Probability of -5% return * -5% return)\n\nE = (0.60 * $800) + (0.40 * -$500)\n\nCalculating each part:\n\n0.60 * $800 = $480\n\n0.40 * -$500 = -$200\n\nAdding them together: $480 - $200 = $280\n\nSo, the expected return from Option B is $280. Adding that to my initial investment, my total would be $10,000 + $280 = $10,280.\n\nComparing the two options:\n\n- Option A gives me $300, totaling $10,300.\n- Option B gives me $280, totaling $10,280.\n\nSince $300 is more than $280, Option A has a higher expected return. Even though Option B has the potential for a higher return (8%) 60% of the time, the expected value takes into account the possibility of losing money 40% of the time, which brings the overall expected return lower than Option A.\n\nI should also consider the risk aspect. Option A is risk-free, while Option B has a significant risk of loss, which might not be worth it for maximizing expected returns in the short term.\n\nSo, based on the expected return calculation, Option A is the better choice for maximizing my expected return after one year.\n</think>\n\nTo determine which investment option maximizes your expected return, let's compare the expected returns of both options using mathematical calculations.\n\n**Option A:**\n- **Return:** 3% annually\n- **Calculation:** \n  - Return = 3% of $10,000 = $300\n  - Total amount after one year = $10,000 + $300 = $10,300\n\n**Option B:**\n- **Possible Returns:**\n  - 60% chance of 8% return: Return = 8% of $10,000 = $800\n  - 40% chance of -5% return: Return = -5% of $10,000 = -$500\n- **Expected Return Calculation:**\n  - Expected Return = (0.60 * $800) + (0.40 * -$500) = $480 - $200 = $280\n  - Total amount after one year = $10,000 + $280 = $10,280\n\n**Comparison:**\n- **Option A:** $10,300\n- **Option B:** $10,280\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOption A provides a higher expected return ($300 vs. $280), making it the better choice for maximizing your expected return after one year.\n\nDONE."

But wait, Option B has a higher potential return of 8%, which is 10% more than Option A's 3%. However, there's also a risk of losing money, which affects the expected return.\n\nI should also consider the risk. Option A is risk-free, while Option B has a 40% chance of losing money. This risk might not be worth it for me since I'm looking to maximize my expected return, not just the potential maximum.\n\nTherefore, even though Option B can offer a higher return in some cases, the expected return is lower, and the risk is higher. So, I should choose Option A because it provides a higher expected return with no risk.\n</think>\n\nTo determine which option maximizes the expected return, let's calculate the expected return for each.\n\n**Option A:**\n- **Return:** 3% of $10,000 = $300\n- **Expected Return:** $300\n\n**Option B:**\n- **Positive Outcome:** 60% chance of 8% return:\n  - Return: $800\n  - Probability-weighted Return: 0.60 * $800 = $480\n- **Negative Outcome:** 40% chance of 5% loss:\n  - Return: -$500\n  - Probability-weighted Return: 0.40 * (-$500) = -$200\n- **Total Expected Return:** $480 + (-$200) = $280\n\nComparing the expected returns:\n- **Option A:** $300\n- **Option B:** $280\n\nSince $300 > $280, **Option A** offers a higher expected return with no risk.\n\n**Final Answer:** You should choose Option A because it provides a higher expected return of $300 compared to Option B's expected return of $280, while also being risk-free.

That means no matter what, I'll get 3% of my investment back after one year. Since I'm investing $10,000, the return would be $10,000 * 0.03 = $300. So, I'm sure to get $300 more in a year.\n\nOption B is a bit riskier. It's a stock investment with two possible outcomes: a 60% chance of earning an 8% annual return and a 40% chance of losing 5% of my investment. Let me break that down. If the stock performs well, I get 8% of $10,000, which is $800. But if it doesn't, I lose 5% of $10,000, which is $500. So, I have two possible outcomes: either +$800 or -$500.\n\nNow, to find out the expected return for Option B, I need to calculate the weighted average of these outcomes. The probability of each outcome is 60% and 40%, respectively. So, the expected return would be:\n\nExpected Return = (Probability of 8% return * 8%) + (Probability of -5% return * -5%)\n\nLet me plug in the numbers:\n\nExpected Return = (0.60 * 8%) + (0.40 * -5%)\n\nCalculating each part:\n\n0.60 * 8% = 4.8%\n0.40 * -5% = -2%\n\nAdding them together: 4.8% - 2% = 2.8%\n\nSo, the expected return for Option B is 2.8%. Comparatively, Option A gives a guaranteed 3% return.\n\nHmm, so Option B has a slightly lower expected return than Option A. But wait, is there a chance that Option B could give a higher return than 3%? Yes, 60% of the time, it gives 8%, which is much higher than 3%. But 40% of the time, it loses 5%, which reduces the overall expected return.\n\nLet me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 60% of 8% is indeed 4.8%, and 40% of -5% is -2%. Adding them gives 2.8%, which is correct. So, Option B's expected return is 2.8%, which is less than 3%.\n\nTherefore, even though Option B has the potential for a higher return, the risk involved brings the expected return down below what Option A offers. Since I'm looking to maximize my expected return, the safer option with a guaranteed 3% is better than the riskier one with a slightly lower expected return.\n\nI think that's it. Option A is the better choice here because it provides a higher expected return with no risk, whereas Option B, although it can be more rewarding in some cases, doesn't consistently outperform the guaranteed bond in terms of expected value.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the optimal investment choice, we compare the expected returns of both options.\n\n**Option A:**\n- **Return:** 3% of $10,000 = $300.\n\n**Option B:**\n- **Possible Returns:**\n  - 60% chance: 8% of $10,000 = $800.\n  - 40% chance: -5% of $10,000 = -$500.\n- **Expected Return Calculation:**\n  - Expected Return = (0.60 * 8%) + (0.40 * -5%) = 4.8% - 2% = 2.8%.\n\n**Comparison:**\n- Option A guarantees 3% ($300), while Option B has an expected return of 2.8%.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOption A is better for maximizing expected return as it provides a guaranteed 3% return compared to Option B's 2.8% expected return.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nYou should choose Option A because it offers a higher guaranteed expected return of 3% compared to Option B's 2.8% expected return.\n\nDONE."
