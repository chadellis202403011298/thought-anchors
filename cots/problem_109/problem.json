  "question": "You are faced with two investment options for your $10,000 savings:\n\nOption A: A conservative bond with a guaranteed 3% annual return.\n\nOption B: A stock investment with a 60% chance of earning an 8% annual return and a 40% chance of losing 5% of your investment.\n\nIf you want to maximize your expected return after one year, which option should you choose and why?",
  "answer": "To determine which investment option maximizes expected return, I need to calculate the expected value of each option.\n\nOption A: Conservative bond with guaranteed 3% return\nExpected return = $10,000 \u00d7 0.03 = $300\nTotal expected value after one year = $10,000 + $300 = $10,300\n\nOption B: Stock investment\nScenario 1 (60% probability): 8% return\nReturn in this scenario = $10,000 \u00d7 0.08 = $800\n\nScenario 2 (40% probability): 5% loss\nLoss in this scenario = $10,000 \u00d7 0.05 = $500\n\nExpected return calculation:\n(0.60 \u00d7 $800) + (0.40 \u00d7 -$500) = $480 - $200 = $280\nTotal expected value after one year = $10,000 + $280 = $10,280\n\nComparing the expected values:\nOption A expected value: $10,300\nOption B expected value: $10,280\n\nTherefore, Option A (the conservative bond) should be chosen to maximize expected return, as its expected value of $10,300 exceeds Option B's expected value of $10,280.\n\nThis problem illustrates a fundamental principle in decision-making under uncertainty: sometimes a guaranteed return can outperform a higher-potential but risky alternative when considering expected value."
