  "question": "Consider the following sequence of transformations:\n\n- 'abc' \u2192 'bdf'\n- 'fgh' \u2192 'gik'\n- 'xyz' \u2192 '?'\n\nWhat is the pattern rule that transforms the first string into the second string in each case, and what would be the transformation of 'xyz' according to this rule?",
  "answer": "To solve this problem, I need to identify the pattern that transforms the first string into the second string.\n\nLet's analyze the transformations we're given:\n\n1. 'abc' \u2192 'bdf'\n   - 'a' becomes 'b': +1 letter in the alphabet\n   - 'b' becomes 'd': +2 letters in the alphabet\n   - 'c' becomes 'f': +3 letters in the alphabet\n\n2. 'fgh' \u2192 'gik'\n   - 'f' becomes 'g': +1 letter in the alphabet\n   - 'g' becomes 'i': +2 letters in the alphabet\n   - 'h' becomes 'k': +3 letters in the alphabet\n\nI see that the pattern involves incrementing each letter's position in the alphabet by its position in the original string:\n- First letter: +1 position\n- Second letter: +2 positions\n- Third letter: +3 positions\n\nApplying this rule to 'xyz':\n- 'x' (+1) \u2192 'y'\n- 'y' (+2) \u2192 'a' (wrapping around the alphabet)\n- 'z' (+3) \u2192 'c' (wrapping around the alphabet)\n\nTherefore, the transformation of 'xyz' would be 'yac'."
