Then, I have to apply this rule to determine what 'xyz' would transform into. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the given transformations:\n\n1. 'abc' \u2192 'bdf'\n2. 'fgh' \u2192 'gik'\n3. 'xyz' \u2192 '?'\n\nMy goal is to find the rule that transforms the first string into the second in each case. I'll start by analyzing the first two transformations to see if I can spot a pattern.\n\nStarting with the first transformation: 'abc' becomes 'bdf'. Let's write down the corresponding letters:\n\n- a \u2192 b\n- b \u2192 d\n- c \u2192 f\n\nHmm, so each letter in the first string is being transformed into another letter. I wonder if there's a shift or some kind of substitution happening here. Let's see if I can find a relationship between the letters.\n\nLooking at the second transformation: 'fgh' becomes 'gik'.\n\n- f \u2192 g\n- g \u2192 i\n- h \u2192 k\n\nAgain, each letter is being transformed into another letter. I need to see if there's a consistent pattern or rule that applies to both transformations.\n\nMaybe it's a simple shift in the alphabet. Let's check that. The alphabet is: a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, q, r, s, t, u, v, w, x, y, z.\n\nLet's see the positions:\n\nFor 'abc' \u2192 'bdf':\n\n- a is the 1st letter. It becomes b, which is the 2nd letter. So, +1.\n- b is the 2nd letter. It becomes d, which is the 4th letter. So, +2.\n- c is the 3rd letter. It becomes f, which is the 6th letter. So, +3.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem to form a consistent pattern. Let's try another approach.\n\nPerhaps it's not a simple shift but a substitution cipher. Maybe each letter is being replaced by another letter based on a specific rule.\n\nLooking at the first transformation again: a\u2192b, b\u2192d, c\u2192f.\n\nLet me write down the substitutions:\n\na \u2192 b\nb \u2192 d\nc \u2192 f\n\nSimilarly, in the second transformation:\n\nf \u2192 g\ng \u2192 i\nh \u2192 k\n\nSo, in both cases, the first letter is being shifted by 1, the second letter by 2, and the third letter by 3.\n\nWait, that seems to fit:\n\n- For 'abc' (a=1, b=2, c=3), each is shifted by their position: +1, +2, +3.\n- For 'fgh' (f=6, g=7, h=8), each is shifted by their position: +1, +2, +3.\n\nSo, applying the same rule to 'xyz' (x=24, y=25, z=26):\n\n- x (24) + 1 = 25 \u2192 y\n- y (25) + 2 = 27 \u2192 z\n- z (26) + 3 = 29 \u2192 ?\n\nBut wait, 29 is beyond the 26-letter alphabet. So, we need to wrap around or use modulo 26.\n\nCalculating 29 modulo 26 gives us 3, which is 'c'. So, z becomes 'c'.\n\nTherefore, 'xyz' would transform into 'yzz'? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, no. If x is 24, adding 1 gives 25, which is 'y'. Then y is 25, adding 2 gives 27. 27 modulo 26 is 1, which is 'a'. Similarly, z is 26, adding 3 gives 29. 29 modulo 26 is 3, which is 'c'.\n\nWait, that doesn't align with the previous shifts. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nLet me recast the positions starting from 0 instead of 1:\n\na=0, b=1, c=2, d=3, e=4, f=5, g=6, h=7, i=8, j=9, k=10, l=11, m=12, n=13, o=14, p=15, q=16, r=17, s=18, t=19, u=20, v=21, w=22, x=23, y=24, z=25.\n\nSo, for 'abc' (a=0, b=1, c=2):\n\n- a (0) +1 =1 \u2192 b\n- b (1) +2 =3 \u2192 d\n- c (2) +3 =5 \u2192 f\n\nSimilarly, 'fgh' (f=5, g=6, h=7):\n\n- f (5) +1 =6 \u2192 g\n- g (6) +2 =8 \u2192 i\n- h (7) +3 =10 \u2192 k\n\nNow, applying this to 'xyz' (x=23, y=24, z=25):\n\n- x (23) +1 =24 \u2192 y\n- y (24) +2 =26 \u2192 26 modulo 26 =0 \u2192 a\n- z (25) +3 =28 \u2192 28 modulo 26 =2 \u2192 c\n\nSo, the transformation would be 'yac'.\n\nBut wait, in the first transformation, adding 1, 2, 3 respectively. So, x becomes y (23\u219224), y becomes a (24\u219226\u22610), z becomes c (25\u219228\u22612). So, 'yac'.\n\nWait, but in the first transformation, 'abc' becomes 'bdf', which is b, d, f. So, the shifts are +1, +2, +3. But in the second transformation, 'fgh' becomes 'gik', which is g, i, k, so same pattern.\n\nTherefore, applying the same rule to 'xyz' would result in 'yac'.\n\nBut the question is, what is the pattern rule? It seems to be that each letter is shifted by its position in the string (1st letter shifted by 1, 2nd by 2, etc.) in the alphabet, wrapping around if necessary.\n\nSo, the rule is: For a string of three letters, each letter is shifted forward in the alphabet by its position index (1st letter +1, 2nd letter +2, 3rd letter +3), with wrap-around if exceeding 'z'.\n\nApplying this to 'xyz':\n\n- x (23) +1 =24 \u2192 y\n- y (24) +2 =26 \u2192 0 \u2192 a\n- z (25) +3 =28 \u2192 2 \u2192 c\n\nSo, 'xyz' \u2192 'yac'.\n\nBut let me confirm with another example to ensure the rule holds. Suppose we have 'def' \u2192 'efg' + something? Wait, let's see.\n\nWait, 'def' would be:\n\n- d (3) +1 =4 \u2192 e\n- e (4) +2 =6 \u2192 g\n- f (5) +3 =8 \u2192 i\n\nSo, 'def' \u2192 'egi'.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the rule is that each letter is shifted forward in the alphabet by its position in the string (1st letter +1, 2nd +2, 3rd +3), wrapping around from z to a.\n\nTherefore, applying this to 'xyz' gives 'yac'.\n</think>\n\nThe transformation rule is that each letter in the string is shifted forward in the alphabet by its position index (1st letter shifted by 1, 2nd by 2, 3rd by 3), wrapping around from 'z' to 'a' if necessary. Applying this to 'xyz':\n\n- x (23) +1 = y (24)\n- y (24) +2 = a (26 mod 26 = 0)\n- z (25) +3 = c (28 mod 26 = 2)\n\nSo, 'xyz' transforms to 'yac'.\n\nANSWER: 'yac' \u2192 DONE."

Let's see, the given transformations are:\n\n- 'abc' \u2192 'bdf'\n- 'fgh' \u2192 'gik'\n- 'xyz' \u2192 '?'\n\nHmm, okay. My goal is to find out what rule is being applied here to change the first string into the second string, and then apply that same rule to 'xyz' to find out what it transforms into. \n\nLet me start by looking at the first transformation: 'abc' becomes 'bdf'. Let's write down the letters and see if I can find a pattern.\n\nOriginal: a, b, c\nResult:  b, d, f\n\nSo, the first letter 'a' becomes 'b', the second letter 'b' stays as 'b', and the third letter 'c' becomes 'f'. Hmm, interesting. So, 'a' is becoming 'b', which is just the next letter in the alphabet. 'b' stays as 'b', so no change there. 'c' becomes 'f'. Wait, 'c' to 'f' is three letters ahead. \n\nLet me check the second transformation to see if this pattern holds. The second transformation is 'fgh' becoming 'gik'. Let's break it down:\n\nOriginal: f, g, h\nResult:  g, i, k\n\nSo, 'f' becomes 'g', which is the next letter. 'g' stays as 'g'. 'h' becomes 'k', which is three letters ahead as well. So, it seems like the pattern is: shift the first letter by one, keep the second letter the same, and shift the third letter by three.\n\nWait, let me make sure. In the first transformation, 'a' becomes 'b' (shift by one), 'b' stays, 'c' becomes 'f' (shift by three). In the second transformation, 'f' becomes 'g' (shift by one), 'g' stays, 'h' becomes 'k' (shift by three). So yes, that seems consistent.\n\nNow, applying this rule to the third transformation: 'xyz' \u2192 '?'. Let's apply the same pattern.\n\nOriginal: x, y, z\nResult: ?\n\nFirst letter 'x' becomes the next letter, which is 'y'. Second letter 'y' stays the same. Third letter 'z' becomes three letters ahead. So, what's three letters after 'z'? Let's count: a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, q, r, s, t, u, v, w, x, y, z. So, starting from 'z', three letters ahead would be 'c' (z + 1 = a, z + 2 = b, z + 3 = c). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because after 'z' comes 'a' again. So, 'z' is the 26th letter, adding 3 would take us to the 29th letter, which is 'c'. But that seems a bit odd because we're looping around the alphabet.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the shift. Let's think differently. Maybe it's not a cyclic shift. So, if 'c' shifts to 'f', that's +3. Similarly, 'h' shifts to 'k', also +3. So, 'z' shifted by +3 would be 'c'. So, 'z' becomes 'c'. \n\nBut wait, 'z' is the last letter, so shifting it by three letters ahead would actually be 'c', considering the alphabet goes from 'a' to 'z'. So, 'z' + 3 = 'c'. That seems a bit counterintuitive because usually, shifts wrap around, but in this problem, maybe it's just a straightforward shift without wrapping. Let me confirm.\n\nIn the first transformation, 'c' becomes 'f', which is +3. So, yes, it's a straightforward shift forward by three letters, without wrapping. So, 'z' shifted by three would be 'c'.\n\nSo, applying the same rule:\n\n- First letter: 'x' becomes 'y' (shift +1)\n- Second letter: 'y' stays the same\n- Third letter: 'z' becomes 'c' (shift +3)\n\nTherefore, 'xyz' would transform into 'yyc'. Wait, that seems a bit odd, but it fits the pattern we've identified.\n\nLet me double-check to make sure I'm not missing anything. \n\nFirst transformation: 'a'\u2192'b' (+1), 'b'\u2192'b' (0), 'c'\u2192'f' (+3) \u2192 'bdf'\n\nSecond transformation: 'f'\u2192'g' (+1), 'g'\u2192'g' (0), 'h'\u2192'k' (+3) \u2192 'gik'\n\nThird transformation: 'x'\u2192'y' (+1), 'y'\u2192'y' (0), 'z'\u2192'c' (+3) \u2192 'yyc'\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the rule is: for each string, the first letter is shifted by one, the second letter stays the same, and the third letter is shifted by three letters forward in the alphabet.\n\nTherefore, applying this rule to 'xyz' gives us 'yyc'.\n</think>\n\nThe pattern involves shifting the first letter by one and the third letter by three, while keeping the second letter unchanged. Applying this to 'xyz' results in 'yyc'.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the transformation rules:**\n   - First letter shifted by +1.\n   - Second letter remains the same.\n   - Third letter shifted by +3.\n\n2. **Apply the rules to 'xyz':**\n   - First letter 'x' becomes 'y'.\n   - Second letter 'y' stays 'y'.\n   - Third letter 'z' becomes 'c' (since z + 3 = c).\n\n3. **Combine the transformed letters:**\n   - 'y' + 'y' + 'c' = 'yyc'.\n\n**Answer:** 'xyz' transforms into 'yyc'.\n\nDONE."

Let's see what we have:\n\n1. 'abc' \u2192 'bdf'\n2. 'fgh' \u2192 'gik'\n3. 'xyz' \u2192 '?'\n\nOkay, first, I need to understand what's happening in each transformation. Let's break down the first one: 'abc' becomes 'bdf'. Hmm, so the first letter 'a' is gone, and the second letter 'b' is now in the first position. Then 'c' is replaced with 'd', and the last letter 'f' comes in. Wait, that doesn't seem to fit. Maybe I'm not looking at it right.\n\nLet me write down the letters with their positions:\n\nOriginal: a (1), b (2), c (3)\nResult:   b (1), d (2), f (3)\n\nSo, the first letter 'a' becomes the second letter 'b', but in the result, 'b' is now the first letter. So maybe it's a shift? Like, each letter moves forward by one position, and the last letter wraps around to the front?\n\nLet me test that idea with the first transformation:\n\na (1) \u2192 b (2)\nb (2) \u2192 c (3)\nc (3) \u2192 a (1)\n\nWait, but in the result, 'a' becomes 'b', 'b' becomes 'd', and 'c' becomes 'f'. Hmm, that doesn't match. Maybe it's not a simple shift.\n\nLet me look at the second transformation: 'fgh' \u2192 'gik'\n\nOriginal: f (1), g (2), h (3)\nResult:   g (1), i (2), k (3)\n\nSo, 'f' becomes 'g', 'g' becomes 'i', and 'h' becomes 'k'. It seems like each letter is being replaced by the next letter in the alphabet. 'f' \u2192 'g', 'g' \u2192 'h'... wait, but in the result, 'g' becomes 'i', not 'h'. That doesn't quite add up.\n\nWait, maybe it's a different kind of shift. Let's think about the positions again.\n\nFirst transformation:\na \u2192 b\nb \u2192 d\nc \u2192 f\n\nSecond transformation:\nf \u2192 g\ng \u2192 i\nh \u2192 k\n\nHmm, so in the first transformation, a to b is +1, but b to d is +2, and c to f is +3. In the second transformation, f to g is +1, g to i is +2, h to k is +3. So maybe it's not a simple shift but adding a certain number to each letter's position.\n\nLet me try assigning numerical values to the letters. Let's say a=1, b=2, c=3, etc.\n\nFirst transformation:\na=1 \u2192 b=2 (+1)\nb=2 \u2192 d=4 (+2)\nc=3 \u2192 f=6 (+3)\n\nSecond transformation:\nf=6 \u2192 g=7 (+1)\ng=7 \u2192 i=9 (+2)\nh=8 \u2192 k=11 (+3)\n\nWait, that seems consistent. So each letter is being increased by its position number. So for the first transformation, each letter is increased by its position in the original string.\n\nBut wait, in the first transformation, 'abc' is three letters, so positions 1,2,3. So:\n\na=1 +1=2=b\nb=2 +2=4=d\nc=3 +3=6=f\n\nThat works for the first one.\n\nIn the second transformation, 'fgh' is three letters, positions 1,2,3.\n\nf=6 +1=7=g\ng=7 +2=9=i\nh=8 +3=11=k\n\nYes, that fits. So the pattern seems to be that each letter in the original string is shifted by its position index (1,2,3,...) in the alphabet. So the first letter is increased by 1, the second by 2, and so on.\n\nNow, let's apply this to the third transformation: 'xyz' \u2192 ?\n\nFirst, write down the letters with their positions:\n\nOriginal: x (1), y (2), z (3)\n\nNow, add their positions to their numerical values:\n\nx=24 +1=25=y\ny=25 +2=27=z\nz=26 +3=29=?\n\nWait, but 26 is 'z', so 26+3=29. What's the 29th letter? Let's count:\n\na(1), b(2),..., z(26), aa(27), ab(28), ac(29). So 29 is 'ac'.\n\nWait, but that seems like two letters. Did I do that right?\n\nWait, no. The original string is 'xyz', which is three letters. So we need to transform each letter individually, not concatenate.\n\nSo each letter is shifted by its position:\n\nx=24 +1=25=y\ny=25 +2=27=z\nz=26 +3=29=?\n\nWait, 24+1=25, which is 'y' again. So x becomes y.\n\n25+2=27, which is 'z'.\n\n26+3=29, which is 'aa' if we go beyond 'z', but that's two letters. Hmm, that doesn't make sense because the result should be a three-letter string.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Maybe it's a cyclic shift within the alphabet, wrapping around after 'z' back to 'a'.\n\nSo, for example, if you have 'z' and add 1, it becomes 'a'. Let's try that.\n\nSo for 'xyz':\n\nx=24 +1=25=y\ny=25 +2=27. Since 27>26, subtract 26 to get 1, which is 'a'.\nz=26 +3=29. 29-26=3, which is 'c'.\n\nSo the transformation would be:\n\nx \u2192 y\ny \u2192 a\nz \u2192 c\n\nSo the result would be 'yac'.\n\nWait, but let's check with the previous ones to see if this makes sense.\n\nFirst transformation: 'abc' \u2192 'bdf'\n\na=1+1=2=b\nb=2+2=4=d\nc=3+3=6=f\nYes, that works.\n\nSecond transformation: 'fgh' \u2192 'gik'\n\nf=6+1=7=g\ng=7+2=9=i\nh=8+3=11=k\nYes, that works too.\n\nSo for 'xyz':\n\nx=24+1=25=y\ny=25+2=27. 27-26=1=a\nz=26+3=29. 29-26=3=c\n\nSo 'xyz' \u2192 'yac'.\n\nWait, but 'yac' is three letters, which matches the original. So that seems to fit.\n\nAlternatively, if we don't wrap around, we get 'ac', but that's two letters, which doesn't fit. So wrapping around makes sense.\n\nTherefore, the pattern is that each letter is shifted forward by its position in the string (1,2,3,...), wrapping around the alphabet as needed. So for 'xyz', x becomes y (shift +1), y becomes a (shift +2, wrapping around), and z becomes c (shift +3, wrapping around). So the result is 'yac'.\n</think>\n\nThe transformation rule is that each letter in the original string is shifted forward by its position index (1, 2, 3, etc.) in the alphabet, wrapping around if necessary. Applying this to 'xyz':\n\n- x (24) +1 = y (25)\n- y (25) +2 = a (1)\n- z (26) +3 = c (3)\n\nThus, 'xyz' transforms to 'yac'.\n\n**Answer:** 'yac'\n\nDONE."

Let me write down what I have:\n\n1. 'abc' \u2192 'bdf'\n2. 'fgh' \u2192 'gik'\n3. 'xyz' \u2192 '?'\n\nI need to find the rule that transforms the first string into the second string in each case and then apply that rule to 'xyz' to find the missing result.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the first transformation: 'abc' becomes 'bdf'. Let me break down each letter:\n\n- 'a' becomes 'b'\n- 'b' becomes 'd'\n- 'c' becomes 'f'\n\nHmm, okay. So each letter is being replaced by another letter. I need to see if there's a pattern or a shift in the alphabet.\n\nLet me recall that in the alphabet, letters go from 'a' to 'z'. So, if I think of each letter as a position in the alphabet, I can try to see how they're shifting.\n\nStarting with 'a' (which is the 1st letter), it becomes 'b' (the 2nd letter). So, it's shifted by 1.\n\nThen 'b' (2nd) becomes 'd' (4th). That's a shift of +2.\n\nNext, 'c' (3rd) becomes 'f' (6th). That's a shift of +3.\n\nWait a minute, so the shift amount is increasing by 1 each time. Let me check the second transformation to see if this pattern holds.\n\nSecond transformation: 'fgh' becomes 'gik'.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- 'f' becomes 'g'\n- 'g' becomes 'i'\n- 'h' becomes 'k'\n\nStarting with 'f' (6th letter), it becomes 'g' (7th). That's a shift of +1.\n\nThen 'g' (7th) becomes 'i' (9th). That's a shift of +2.\n\nNext, 'h' (8th) becomes 'k' (11th). That's a shift of +3.\n\nOkay, so the shift amounts are indeed increasing by 1 each time. So, the first letter is shifted by 1, the second by 2, the third by 3, and so on.\n\nIf that's the case, then for the third transformation, 'xyz' becomes something. Let's apply the same pattern.\n\nBreaking down 'xyz':\n\n- 'x' is the 24th letter.\n- 'y' is the 25th.\n- 'z' is the 26th.\n\nNow, applying the shifts:\n\n1. Shift 1: 24 + 1 = 25 \u2192 'y'\n2. Shift 2: 25 + 2 = 27 \u2192 'z'\n3. Shift 3: 26 + 3 = 29 \u2192 'a'\n\nWait, 29th letter. But the alphabet only has 26 letters. So, we need to wrap around. That is, after 'z' (26), it goes back to 'a' (1).\n\nSo, 29 - 26 = 3 \u2192 'c'\n\nTherefore, the transformation would be 'yza'.\n\nLet me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with 'x' (24), shift 1 \u2192 25 \u2192 'y'.\n\n'y' (25), shift 2 \u2192 27 \u2192 'z'.\n\n'z' (26), shift 3 \u2192 29 \u2192 'a' (since 29 mod 26 = 3, which is 'c').\n\nWait, hold on. 26 + 3 = 29, but 29 mod 26 is 3, not 29. So, the 29th letter is actually 'c' because 'a' is 1, 'b' is 2, 'c' is 3.\n\nSo, the third letter becomes 'c'.\n\nTherefore, the transformation of 'xyz' is 'yza'.\n\nBut let me make sure this pattern holds for all three cases.\n\nFirst transformation: 'abc' \u2192 'bdf'\n\na(1)+1=2 \u2192 b\n\nb(2)+2=4 \u2192 d\n\nc(3)+3=6 \u2192 f\n\nYes, that works.\n\nSecond transformation: 'fgh' \u2192 'gik'\n\nf(6)+1=7 \u2192 g\n\ng(7)+2=9 \u2192 i\n\nh(8)+3=11 \u2192 k\n\nThat also works.\n\nThird transformation: 'xyz' \u2192 'yza'\n\nx(24)+1=25 \u2192 y\n\ny(25)+2=27 \u2192 z\n\nz(26)+3=29 \u2192 29-26=3 \u2192 c\n\nWait, but in my first calculation, I thought it was 'yza', but now I'm getting 'yza' again. Wait, no, 29 is 'c', so the third letter becomes 'c', making it 'yza'?\n\nWait, let's clarify:\n\nIf 'z' is 26, adding 3 gives 29.\n\nBut since the alphabet has only 26 letters, 29 mod 26 is 3, which corresponds to 'c'.\n\nSo, the third letter becomes 'c', making the transformed string 'yza'.\n\nWait, but if 'z' becomes 'c', then the third letter is 'c', so the transformed string is 'yza'.\n\nBut wait, in the first transformation, 'c' becomes 'f' which is +3, so that's correct.\n\nIn the second transformation, 'h' becomes 'k' which is +3, so that's correct.\n\nSo, applying the same logic, 'z' becomes 'c'.\n\nTherefore, the transformation of 'xyz' is 'yza'.\n\nBut let me check once more to be sure.\n\nx(24)+1=25 \u2192 y\n\ny(25)+2=27 \u2192 z\n\nz(26)+3=29 \u2192 29-26=3 \u2192 c\n\nSo, the letters are y, z, c \u2192 'yza'.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nI think that's the correct pattern and transformation.\n</think>\n\nThe pattern involves shifting each letter by an incrementing value: the first letter is shifted by 1, the second by 2, the third by 3, and so on. Applying this to 'xyz':\n\n- 'x' (24) +1 = 25 \u2192 'y'\n- 'y' (25) +2 = 27 \u2192 'z'\n- 'z' (26) +3 = 29 \u2192 29 mod 26 = 3 \u2192 'c'\n\nThus, 'xyz' transforms to 'yza'.\n\n**Answer:** 'xyz' \u2192 'yza'  \nDONE."

Then, I have to apply that rule to 'xyz' to find out what it transforms into. Let me take it step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the examples given:\n\n1. 'abc' \u2192 'bdf'\n2. 'fgh' \u2192 'gik'\n3. 'xyz' \u2192 '?'\n\nOkay, so each transformation seems to be taking the first string and turning it into the second string. My goal is to figure out what operation is being performed on each character in the first string to get the corresponding characters in the second string.\n\nLet me start by analyzing the first transformation: 'abc' becomes 'bdf'.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- The first character in the first string is 'a', and in the second string, it's 'b'.\n- The second character in the first string is 'b', and in the second string, it's 'd'.\n- The third character in the first string is 'c', and in the second string, it's 'f'.\n\nHmm, so each character is being transformed into another character. Let me see if I can find a pattern or a shift in the alphabet.\n\nStarting with 'a' becoming 'b'. If I think about the alphabet, 'a' is the first letter, and 'b' is the second. So, 'a' is being shifted by one position forward in the alphabet.\n\nNext, 'b' becomes 'd'. Wait a minute, that's not a shift of one. 'b' is the second letter, and 'd' is the fourth. That's a shift of two positions forward. But hold on, 'c' becomes 'f'. 'c' is the third letter, and 'f' is the sixth. That's a shift of three positions forward.\n\nSo, in the first transformation, each character is being shifted forward by a number of positions equal to its position in the string. Let's test this:\n\n- First character 'a' is shifted by 1 \u2192 'b'\n- Second character 'b' is shifted by 2 \u2192 'd'\n- Third character 'c' is shifted by 3 \u2192 'f'\n\nThat seems to work! So, the rule is that each character in the first string is shifted forward in the alphabet by a number of places equal to its position in the string (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.).\n\nLet me check this with the second transformation: 'fgh' \u2192 'gik'.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- First character 'f' is shifted by 1 \u2192 'g' (since 'f' is the 6th letter, adding 1 gives 'g')\n- Second character 'g' is shifted by 2 \u2192 'i' (since 'g' is the 7th letter, adding 2 gives 'i')\n- Third character 'h' is shifted by 3 \u2192 'k' (since 'h' is the 8th letter, adding 3 gives 'k')\n\nYes, that works too! So, the same rule applies: each character is shifted forward by its position index.\n\nNow, applying this rule to 'xyz' to find the transformation.\n\nFirst, let's list the positions:\n\n- 'x' is the first character, so it's shifted by 1.\n- 'y' is the second character, so it's shifted by 2.\n- 'z' is the third character, so it's shifted by 3.\n\nNow, let's find the corresponding letters after shifting.\n\nStarting with 'x':\n\n- 'x' is the 24th letter in the alphabet (a=1, b=2, ..., x=24).\n- Adding 1: 24 + 1 = 25 \u2192 'y'\n\nNext, 'y':\n\n- 'y' is the 25th letter.\n- Adding 2: 25 + 2 = 27 \u2192 'z'\n\nWait, but the 27th letter is 'z'. But hold on, the alphabet only has 26 letters. So, after 'z' (26), the next letter would be 'a' (1). Therefore, 27 mod 26 is 1, which corresponds to 'a'.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 'y' shifted by 2 would be 'z' if we wrap around, but let's check:\n\nIf 'y' is 25, adding 2 gives 27. Since 26 letters, 27 - 26 = 1, which is 'a'. So, 'y' becomes 'a'.\n\nNow, 'z':\n\n- 'z' is the 26th letter.\n- Adding 3: 26 + 3 = 29.\n- 29 mod 26 = 3 \u2192 'c'\n\nWait, that doesn't seem to fit the pattern because 'z' is the last letter, adding 3 should wrap around twice, ending up at 'c' (since 26 + 3 = 29, 29 - 26 = 3, which is 'c').\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n- 'x' shifted by 1 \u2192 'y'\n- 'y' shifted by 2 \u2192 'a'\n- 'z' shifted by 3 \u2192 'c'\n\nTherefore, 'xyz' transforms into 'yac'.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the shifting:\n\nFor 'x' (24) +1 =25 \u2192 'y' \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor 'y' (25) +2=27 \u2192 27-26=1 \u2192 'a' \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor 'z' (26) +3=29 \u219229-26=3 \u2192 'c' \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the transformation rule is that each character in the first string is shifted forward in the alphabet by its position index. If the shift goes beyond 'z', it wraps around to the beginning of the alphabet.\n\nApplying this to 'xyz':\n\n- x (24) +1 = y (25)\n- y (25) +2 = a (1)\n- z (26) +3 = c (3)\n\nSo, the result is 'yac'.\n\nI think that's the correct transformation.\n</think>\n\nThe transformation rule is that each character in the first string is shifted forward in the alphabet by a number of positions equal to its position in the string. If the shift exceeds 'z', it wraps around to the beginning of the alphabet.\n\nApplying this rule to 'xyz':\n\n- 'x' (24) +1 = 'y' (25)\n- 'y' (25) +2 = 'a' (1)\n- 'z' (26) +3 = 'c' (3)\n\nSo, 'xyz' transforms into 'yac'.\n\n**Answer:** The transformation of 'xyz' is 'yac'.

Then, I have to apply that rule to 'xyz' to find out what the transformed string would be. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the given transformations:\n\n1. 'abc' \u2192 'bdf'\n2. 'fgh' \u2192 'gik'\n3. 'xyz' \u2192 '?'\n\nAlright, so my goal is to find out what rule is being applied here to turn the first string into the second. Once I figure that out, I can apply the same rule to 'xyz' to get the missing transformation.\n\nLet me start by analyzing the first transformation: 'abc' becomes 'bdf'. Hmm, so let's see what changes here. The original string is 'a', 'b', 'c', and the transformed string is 'b', 'd', 'f'. So, each letter is being replaced by another letter. Let me write that down:\n\nOriginal: a \u2192 b  \nOriginal: b \u2192 d  \nOriginal: c \u2192 f  \n\nWait, that's interesting. So, each letter is being shifted to another letter. Maybe it's some kind of substitution cipher or a shift in the alphabet. Let me check the positions of these letters in the alphabet to see if there's a pattern.\n\nIn the English alphabet, 'a' is the 1st letter, 'b' is the 2nd, 'c' is the 3rd, and so on. Let's see:\n\n- 'a' (1) becomes 'b' (2) \u2192 that's a shift of +1\n- 'b' (2) becomes 'd' (4) \u2192 shift of +2\n- 'c' (3) becomes 'f' (6) \u2192 shift of +3\n\nOh, I see! So, each letter is being shifted by its own position in the alphabet. That is, the first letter 'a' is shifted by +1, the second letter 'b' by +2, and so on. Let's test this with the second transformation to see if it holds.\n\nSecond transformation: 'fgh' \u2192 'gik'\n\nLet's break it down:\n\nOriginal: f \u2192 g  \nOriginal: g \u2192 i  \nOriginal: h \u2192 k  \n\nNow, let's check the shifts based on their positions:\n\n- 'f' is the 6th letter. So, 6 + 6 = 12 \u2192 'l' (12th letter). But wait, the transformed letter is 'g', which is the 7th letter. That doesn't match. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Maybe it's not a shift based on the position in the original string, but rather based on the position in the alphabet. So, 'f' is the 6th letter, so a shift of +6. 'f' shifted by +6 would be 'l' (6 + 6 = 12). But the transformed letter is 'g', which is the 7th letter. That doesn't align. Maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Maybe it's not a shift but a substitution based on some other rule. Let's look at the first transformation again: 'abc' \u2192 'bdf'. So, a\u2192b, b\u2192d, c\u2192f.\n\nIf I think of 'a' becoming 'b', that's a shift of +1. 'b' becoming 'd' is a shift of +2, and 'c' becoming 'f' is a shift of +3. So, each letter is being shifted by one more than the previous letter's shift. Wait, that might not make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a Caesar cipher with a shift of +1, +2, +3, etc., depending on the position in the string. Let's test that.\n\nIn the first transformation, 'abc' is the first string. So, each letter is shifted by its position in the string:\n\n- First letter 'a' shifted by +1 \u2192 'b'\n- Second letter 'b' shifted by +2 \u2192 'd'\n- Third letter 'c' shifted by +3 \u2192 'f'\n\nYes, that works for the first transformation. Now, let's check the second transformation: 'fgh' \u2192 'gik'.\n\nSo, 'f' is the first letter, 'g' is the second, 'h' is the third.\n\n- First letter 'f' shifted by +1 \u2192 'g' (since 'f' is the 6th letter, 6 + 1 = 7 \u2192 'g')\n- Second letter 'g' shifted by +2 \u2192 'i' (7 + 2 = 9 \u2192 'i')\n- Third letter 'h' shifted by +3 \u2192 'k' (8 + 3 = 11 \u2192 'k')\n\nYes, that matches the second transformation. So, the rule seems to be that each letter in the original string is shifted by its position in the string (1st letter shifted by +1, 2nd letter by +2, and so on). That makes sense.\n\nNow, let's apply this rule to the third transformation: 'xyz' \u2192 '?'\n\nSo, 'x' is the first letter, 'y' is the second, 'z' is the third.\n\n- First letter 'x' shifted by +1: 'x' is the 24th letter, so 24 + 1 = 25 \u2192 'y'\n- Second letter 'y' shifted by +2: 'y' is the 25th letter, so 25 + 2 = 27 \u2192 'z'\n- Third letter 'z' shifted by +3: 'z' is the 26th letter, so 26 + 3 = 29. But wait, the alphabet only has 26 letters. So, 29 - 26 = 3 \u2192 'c'\n\nSo, putting it all together, 'x' becomes 'y', 'y' becomes 'z', and 'z' becomes 'c'. Therefore, 'xyz' transforms to 'y z c', which is 'y z c'.\n\nWait, that doesn't look right. Let me double-check the shifts.\n\nFirst letter 'x' (24) +1 =25 \u2192 'y' \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSecond letter 'y' (25) +2 =27 \u2192 'z' \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThird letter 'z' (26) +3 =29 \u2192 29-26=3 \u2192 'c' \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, 'xyz' becomes 'y z c', which we can write as 'y z c' or 'yza' if we consider the letters without spaces. Wait, no, it's 'y', 'z', 'c', so the transformed string is 'y z c'.\n\nBut in the original examples, the transformed strings are of the same length as the original strings. So, 'abc' becomes 'bdf', which is 3 letters, and 'fgh' becomes 'gik', also 3 letters. Therefore, 'xyz' should become a 3-letter string: 'y z c'.\n\nSo, the final transformation is 'y z c'.\n</think>\n\nThe pattern rule is that each letter in the original string is shifted by its position in the string (1st letter shifted by +1, 2nd by +2, etc.). Applying this to 'xyz':\n\n- x (24) +1 = y\n- y (25) +2 = z\n- z (26) +3 = c\n\nSo, 'xyz' transforms to 'y z c'.\n\nDONE."

Then, I have to apply this rule to the third string, 'xyz', to find its transformation. Let me take this step by step because I'm still getting the hang of these kinds of problems.\n\nFirst, let's look at the given transformations:\n\n1. 'abc' \u2192 'bdf'\n2. 'fgh' \u2192 'gik'\n3. 'xyz' \u2192 '?'\n\nOkay, so each transformation seems to take a three-letter string and turns it into another three-letter string. My goal is to find the rule that transforms the first string into the second string in each case. Once I figure out that rule, I can apply it to 'xyz' to find its transformation.\n\nLet me start by examining the first transformation: 'abc' becomes 'bdf'. Let's break this down letter by letter.\n\n- The first letter of the first string is 'a', and in the second string, it becomes 'b'.\n- The second letter is 'b' in the first string, which stays 'b' in the second string.\n- The third letter is 'c' in the first string, which becomes 'f' in the second string.\n\nHmm, so the first letter changes from 'a' to 'b', the second letter stays the same, and the third letter changes from 'c' to 'f'. Is there a pattern here? Maybe each letter is being shifted by a certain number of positions in the alphabet?\n\nLet's test that idea with the second transformation: 'fgh' becomes 'gik'.\n\n- The first letter 'f' becomes 'g'. That's a shift of +1.\n- The second letter 'g' stays the same.\n- The third letter 'h' becomes 'k'. Now, 'h' to 'k' is also a shift of +2, because 'h' is the 8th letter and 'k' is the 11th letter, which is a difference of 3. Wait, that doesn't match the first shift.\n\nWait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me write down the positions:\n\n- 'a' is 1, 'b' is 2, 'c' is 3, 'd' is 4, 'e' is 5, 'f' is 6, 'g' is 7, 'h' is 8, 'i' is 9, 'j' is 10, 'k' is 11, 'l' is 12, and so on.\n\nSo, in the first transformation:\n\n- 'a' (1) \u2192 'b' (2): shift +1\n- 'b' (2) stays 'b' (2): shift 0\n- 'c' (3) \u2192 'f' (6): shift +3\n\nWait, that's inconsistent. The first letter shifts +1, the second stays the same, and the third shifts +3. That doesn't seem to follow a simple shift pattern.\n\nLet me check the second transformation again:\n\n- 'f' (6) \u2192 'g' (7): shift +1\n- 'g' (7) stays 'g' (7): shift 0\n- 'h' (8) \u2192 'k' (11): shift +3\n\nOkay, so now I see that in both transformations, the first letter shifts +1, the second letter stays the same, and the third letter shifts +3. That's interesting. So maybe each letter is being shifted by a certain number, but not the same number each time.\n\nBut let's see if that holds for the third transformation, which is 'xyz' \u2192 '?'. If I can figure out the pattern, I can apply it to 'xyz'.\n\nSo, let's see:\n\nFirst, let's write down the positions:\n\n- 'x' is the 24th letter\n- 'y' is the 25th\n- 'z' is the 26th\n\nNow, applying the same pattern as before:\n\n- First letter shifts +1: 24 +1 = 25 \u2192 'y'\n- Second letter stays the same: 25 \u2192 'y'\n- Third letter shifts +3: 26 +3 = 29. But wait, there are only 26 letters in the alphabet. So, 29 -26 = 3. So, 3 \u2192 'c'\n\nSo, putting it all together, 'xyz' would transform to 'yyc'. But that seems a bit odd. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the third transformation. Let me go back.\n\nIn the first transformation:\n\n- 'a' (1) \u2192 'b' (2): +1\n- 'b' (2) stays 'b' (2): 0\n- 'c' (3) \u2192 'f' (6): +3\n\nIn the second transformation:\n\n- 'f' (6) \u2192 'g' (7): +1\n- 'g' (7) stays 'g' (7): 0\n- 'h' (8) \u2192 'k' (11): +3\n\nSo, the pattern seems to be:\n\n1. First letter shifts +1.\n2. Second letter stays the same.\n3. Third letter shifts +3.\n\nIf that's the case, then for 'xyz':\n\n1. 'x' (24) \u2192 'y' (25): +1\n2. 'y' (25) stays 'y' (25)\n3. 'z' (26) \u2192 'c' (3): 26 +3 = 29. Since 29 >26, we wrap around. So, 29 -26=3, which is 'c'.\n\nSo, the transformation would be 'yyc'.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Is there another pattern? Maybe each transformation is a Caesar cipher with a different shift for each position.\n\nIn the first transformation:\n\n- First letter shifted +1\n- Second letter stayed the same\n- Third letter shifted +3\n\nIn the second transformation:\n\n- First letter shifted +1\n- Second letter stayed the same\n- Third letter shifted +3\n\nSo, it's consistent across both transformations. Therefore, applying the same rule to 'xyz' would give 'yyc'.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the shifts are based on the position in the string. Let's see:\n\nIn the first string 'abc':\n\n- First letter 'a' (1) shifted by +1 to 'b' (2)\n- Second letter 'b' (2) shifted by 0 to 'b' (2)\n- Third letter 'c' (3) shifted by +3 to 'f' (6)\n\nIn the second string 'fgh':\n\n- First letter 'f' (6) shifted by +1 to 'g' (7)\n- Second letter 'g' (7) shifted by 0 to 'g' (7)\n- Third letter 'h' (8) shifted by +3 to 'k' (11)\n\nSo, the shift for the first letter is always +1, the second letter remains the same, and the third letter shifts +3.\n\nTherefore, applying this to 'xyz':\n\n- First letter 'x' (24) shifted by +1 \u2192 'y' (25)\n- Second letter 'y' (25) remains 'y' (25)\n- Third letter 'z' (26) shifted by +3 \u2192 26 +3 =29 \u2192 29-26=3 \u2192 'c'\n\nSo, the transformed string would be 'yyc'.\n\nBut let me think differently. Maybe the shifts are not fixed but related to the position in the original string.\n\nWait, in the first transformation, 'a' \u2192 'b' (+1), 'b' stays, 'c' \u2192 'f' (+3). In the second, 'f' \u2192 'g' (+1), 'g' stays, 'h' \u2192 'k' (+3). So, the shifts are consistent: +1, 0, +3.\n\nTherefore, the rule is:\n\n- Take the first letter, shift it +1.\n- Keep the second letter the same.\n- Take the third letter and shift it +3.\n\nSo, applying this to 'xyz':\n\n- 'x' shifted +1 is 'y'\n- 'y' stays 'y'\n- 'z' shifted +3 is 'c'\n\nThus, 'xyz' becomes 'yyc'.\n\nBut let me make sure I'm not missing something. Maybe the shifts are based on the letters themselves, like some kind of substitution cipher.\n\nLooking at the first transformation:\n\n- 'a' \u2192 'b' (next letter)\n- 'b' stays 'b'\n- 'c' \u2192 'f' (three letters ahead)\n\nSecond transformation:\n\n- 'f' \u2192 'g' (next letter)\n- 'g' stays 'g'\n- 'h' \u2192 'k' (three letters ahead)\n\nSo, it seems that the first letter is always shifted +1, the second letter stays, and the third letter is shifted +3.\n\nTherefore, applying this to 'xyz':\n\n- 'x' \u2192 'y' (+1)\n- 'y' stays 'y'\n- 'z' \u2192 'c' (+3, wraps around)\n\nSo, the result is 'yyc'.\n\nI think that's consistent. So, the pattern rule is:\n\n1. Shift the first letter by +1 in the alphabet.\n2. Keep the second letter unchanged.\n3. Shift the third letter by +3 in the alphabet, wrapping around if necessary.\n\nApplying this to 'xyz' gives 'yyc'.\n</think>\n\nThe pattern rule is: Shift the first letter by +1, keep the second letter the same, and shift the third letter by +3. Applying this to 'xyz' results in 'yyc'.\n\nDONE."

End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: Consider the following sequence of transformations:\n\n- 'abc' \u2192 'bdf'\n- 'fgh' \u2192 'gik'\n- 'xyz' \u2192 '?'\n\nWhat is the pattern rule that transforms the first string into the second string in each case, and what would be the transformation of 'xyz' according to this rule? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this sequence of transformations here:\n\n1. 'abc' \u2192 'bdf'\n2. 'fgh' \u2192 'gik'\n3. 'xyz' \u2192 '?'\n\nI need to figure out the pattern that transforms the first string into the second string in each case and then determine what 'xyz' would become. Let me start by analyzing each transformation step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the first transformation: 'abc' becomes 'bdf'. Let me write down the original and the transformed strings:\n\nOriginal: a b c\nTransformed: b d f\n\nSo, each letter in the original string is being replaced by another letter in the transformed string. Let me see if there's a pattern here.\n\n- The first letter 'a' becomes 'b'.\n- The second letter 'b' becomes 'd'.\n- The third letter 'c' becomes 'f'.\n\nHmm, I wonder if there's a shift or some kind of offset happening here. Let me look at the positions of the letters in the alphabet. Remember, the alphabet goes from a=1, b=2, c=3, d=4, e=5, f=6, and so on.\n\n- a (1) \u2192 b (2) \u2192 increase by 1\n- b (2) \u2192 d (4) \u2192 increase by 2\n- c (3) \u2192 f (6) \u2192 increase by 3\n\nOh, I see! It looks like each letter is being shifted by one more than the previous letter's shift. So, the first letter increases by 1, the second by 2, and the third by 3. That would mean each subsequent letter is shifted by an incrementing number.\n\nLet me check if this pattern holds for the second transformation: 'fgh' becomes 'gik'.\n\nOriginal: f g h\nTransformed: g i k\n\nAgain, let's look at the letter positions:\n\n- f (6) \u2192 g (7) \u2192 increase by 1\n- g (7) \u2192 i (9) \u2192 increase by 2\n- h (8) \u2192 k (11) \u2192 increase by 3\n\nYes, the same pattern! Each letter is shifted by one more than the previous shift. So, the first letter increases by 1, the second by 2, and the third by 3.\n\nNow, I need to apply this pattern to the third transformation: 'xyz' \u2192 '?'.\n\nOriginal: x y z\nTransformed: ? ? ?\n\nLet me find out the positions of these letters:\n\n- x is the 24th letter (a=1, b=2, ..., x=24)\n- y is the 25th letter\n- z is the 26th letter\n\nNow, applying the same shifting pattern:\n\n- First letter shift: 1\n- Second letter shift: 2\n- Third letter shift: 3\n\nSo, let's calculate each transformed letter:\n\n1. x (24) + 1 = 25 \u2192 y\n2. y (25) + 2 = 27 \u2192 a (since 26 is z, 27 is a)\n3. z (26) + 3 = 29 \u2192 b (since 27 is a, 28 is b, 29 is c)\n\nWait a minute, 29 is c? Let me double-check:\n\n- 26 (z) + 3 = 29\n- Since the alphabet has 26 letters, 29 - 26 = 3, which is c.\n\nSo, the transformed string would be 'yac'.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me write down the steps again:\n\n1. x (24) + 1 = 25 \u2192 y\n2. y (25) + 2 = 27 \u2192 a\n3. z (26) + 3 = 29 \u2192 c\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the transformation of 'xyz' would be 'yac'.\n</think>\n\nThe pattern shifts each letter in the original string by an incrementing number: the first letter shifts by 1, the second by 2, and the third by 3. Applying this to 'xyz':\n\n- x (24) +1 = y (25)\n- y (25) +2 = a (27)\n- z (26) +3 = c (29)\n\nSo, the transformation of 'xyz' is 'yac'.\n\nDONE."

So, we have these three transformations:\n\n1. 'abc' becomes 'bdf'\n2. 'fgh' becomes 'gik'\n3. 'xyz' becomes '?'\n\nHmm, okay, I need to find out what rule transforms the first string into the second in each case. Let me look at the first transformation: 'abc' to 'bdf'. Let's break it down letter by letter.\n\n- The first letter 'a' in 'abc' becomes 'b' in 'bdf'.\n- The second letter 'b' stays the same.\n- The third letter 'c' becomes 'f'.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, the second letter stays the same, but the first and third letters change. Maybe it's some sort of shift or replacement.\n\nLet me check the second transformation: 'fgh' to 'gik'.\n\n- The first letter 'f' becomes 'g'.\n- The second letter 'g' stays the same.\n- The third letter 'h' becomes 'k'.\n\nHmm, similar pattern here. First letter changes, second stays, third changes.\n\nSo, if I look at the first transformation again: 'a' to 'b', 'c' to 'f'. What's the relationship between 'a' and 'b'? Well, 'a' is the first letter of the alphabet, 'b' is the second. So maybe it's shifting each letter by one position.\n\nBut wait, in the first transformation, 'c' becomes 'f'. 'c' is the third letter, and 'f' is the sixth letter. That doesn't seem like a simple shift. Maybe it's a different kind of transformation.\n\nLet me think about the second transformation: 'f' becomes 'g', which is just a shift by one. 'h' becomes 'k', which is also a shift by one. So maybe the first letter shifts by one, and the third letter shifts by some other amount.\n\nWait, 'c' to 'f' is a shift by three letters: c -> d -> e -> f. So, that's a shift of +3. Similarly, 'h' to 'k' is a shift of +3 as well: h -> i -> j -> k.\n\nOh, I see! So, in both transformations, the first letter is shifted by +1, and the third letter is shifted by +3.\n\nLet me test this with the third transformation: 'xyz' to '?'. So, applying the same rule:\n\n- 'x' shifted by +1 becomes 'y'.\n- 'y' stays the same.\n- 'z' shifted by +3 becomes 'c'.\n\nSo, putting it all together, 'xyz' would become 'yyc'.\n\nWait, does that make sense? Let me double-check.\n\nYes, 'x' -> 'y', 'y' stays, 'z' -> 'c'. So, 'xyz' becomes 'yyc'.\n</think>\n\nThe pattern rule is that each string transforms by incrementing the first letter by one and the third letter by three. Applying this to 'xyz' results in 'yyc'.\n\n**Answer:** 'xyz' \u2192 'yyc'\n\nDONE."

End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: Consider the following sequence of transformations:\n\n- 'abc' \u2192 'bdf'\n- 'fgh' \u2192 'gik'\n- 'xyz' \u2192 '?'\n\nWhat is the pattern rule that transforms the first string into the second string in each case, and what would be the transformation of 'xyz' according to this rule? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out the pattern in these transformations. Let's see what we've got here. \n\nFirst transformation: 'abc' becomes 'bdf'. Okay, so the first letter 'a' is replaced by 'b', which is the second letter. Then 'b' stays as 'b', and 'c' becomes 'f'. Hmm, that's interesting. So the first letter moves to the second position, and the last letter changes to 'f'. \n\nSecond transformation: 'fgh' turns into 'gik'. So, 'f' becomes 'g', 'g' stays as 'g', and 'h' turns into 'k'. Wait a minute, that's similar to the first one. The first letter moves up by one position, and the last letter changes again. \n\nSo, if I look at the first letters:\n- 'a' becomes 'b'\n- 'f' becomes 'g'\n\nIt seems like each first letter is being replaced by the next letter in the alphabet. So 'a' \u2192 'b', 'f' \u2192 'g', and if this pattern continues, the next one would be 'm' \u2192 'n' or something like that.\n\nNow, looking at the last letters:\n- 'c' becomes 'f'\n- 'h' becomes 'k'\n\nLet's see the sequence here. 'c' is the third letter, 'f' is the sixth letter. 'h' is the eighth letter, and 'k' is the eleventh letter. Hmm, that seems like adding 3 each time. So from 'c' (3) to 'f' (6), that's +3. From 'h' (8) to 'k' (11), also +3. So maybe the last letter is being shifted three places forward in the alphabet.\n\nLet me test this with the first transformation again. If 'c' is shifted three places, 'c' \u2192 'f' (c, d, e, f). Yep, that works. And 'h' shifted three places is 'k' (h, i, j, k). That also works.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the transformation seems to be:\n1. The first letter is replaced by the next letter in the alphabet.\n2. The last letter is shifted three places forward in the alphabet.\n\nLet me see if this applies to both transformations:\n\nFirst transformation:\n- 'a' \u2192 'b' (next letter)\n- 'c' \u2192 'f' (+3)\n\nSecond transformation:\n- 'f' \u2192 'g' (next letter)\n- 'h' \u2192 'k' (+3)\n\nYes, that fits perfectly.\n\nNow, applying this to 'xyz' to find the third transformation.\n\nFirst letter: 'x'\n- Next letter after 'x' is 'y'.\n\nLast letter: 'z'\n- Shifting 'z' three places forward. Since 'z' is the last letter, after 'z' comes 'a', 'b', 'c'. So 'z' \u2192 'c' (+3).\n\nSo, the transformation of 'xyz' would be 'y' followed by whatever the middle letter is (but in the previous examples, the middle letter stayed the same) and ending with 'c'. So 'y' + middle + 'c'.\n\nWait, but in the given examples, the middle letter didn't change. So 'b' stayed as 'b', 'g' stayed as 'g'. So I think the middle letter remains the same.\n\nTherefore, 'xyz' would transform to 'y' + middle + 'c', but since the middle letter in 'xyz' is 'y', wait, no, 'xyz' is 'x', 'y', 'z'. So middle letter is 'y'.\n\nWait, no, the middle letter in 'xyz' is 'y', so after transformation, the middle letter should stay 'y', so the transformed string would be 'y' followed by 'y' followed by 'c', making it 'yy c'? Or is it 'yyc'?\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because 'yyc' is three letters, but the original is three letters. So 'xyz' becomes 'yyc'.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The first letter 'x' becomes 'y', the middle 'y' stays, and the last 'z' becomes 'c'. So, 'y' 'y' 'c' \u2192 'yyc'.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the transformation rule is:\n1. The first letter is replaced by the next letter in the alphabet.\n2. The last letter is shifted three places forward.\n3. The middle letter remains unchanged.\n\nApplying this to 'xyz':\n- First letter 'x' \u2192 'y'\n- Middle letter 'y' stays 'y'\n- Last letter 'z' \u2192 'c'\n\nSo, the transformed string is 'yyc'.\n</think>\n\nThe pattern involves shifting the first letter to the next in the alphabet and moving the last letter three places forward. Applying this to 'xyz', we get 'yyc'.\n\n**Answer:** The transformation of 'xyz' is 'yyc'. DONE."
