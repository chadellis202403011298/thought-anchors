After 4 weeks, she measures the height (in cm) of each plant.

Then, based on the data provided, would you reject the null hypothesis at a significance level of 0.05? Explain your reasoning step by step. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to help a researcher test whether a new fertilizer actually increases tomato plant growth compared to the standard fertilizer. She's using 30 seedlings, splitting them into two groups of 15. One group gets the new fertilizer, and the other gets the standard. After four weeks, she measures the height of each plant.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the appropriate null and alternative hypotheses. The null hypothesis, H\u2080, usually states that there's no effect, or that both groups have the same mean height. The alternative hypothesis, H\u2081, will then state that there is an effect\u2014specifically, that the new fertilizer increases the mean height compared to the standard.\n\nSo, mathematically, H\u2080 would be that the mean height of the new fertilizer group is equal to the mean height of the standard fertilizer group. That would be H\u2080: \u03bc\u2081 = \u03bc\u2082, where \u03bc\u2081 is the mean for the new fertilizer and \u03bc\u2082 for the standard.\n\nThe alternative hypothesis, since we're testing for an increase, would be H\u2081: \u03bc\u2081 > \u03bc\u2082. This is a one-tailed test because we're only interested in whether the new fertilizer leads to a higher mean, not lower or no effect.\n\nNext, I need to determine whether to reject the null hypothesis at a 0.05 significance level. To do this, I should calculate a test statistic and compare it to a critical value or use a p-value approach.\n\nThe data provided gives the means and standard deviations for both groups. The new fertilizer group has a mean of 28.5 cm with a standard deviation of 3.2 cm, and the standard fertilizer group has a mean of 25.7 cm with a standard deviation of 3.5 cm. Since the sample sizes are equal (15 each), I can use a two-sample t-test.\n\nThe formula for the two-sample t-test statistic is:\n\nt = (mean\u2081 - mean\u2082) / sqrt[(s\u2081\u00b2/n\u2081) + (s\u2082\u00b2/n\u2082)]\n\nWhere:\n- mean\u2081 and mean\u2082 are the sample means\n- s\u2081 and s\u2082 are the sample standard deviations\n- n\u2081 and n\u2082 are the sample sizes\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nmean\u2081 = 28.5, mean\u2082 = 25.7\ns\u2081 = 3.2, s\u2082 = 3.5\nn\u2081 = n\u2082 = 15\n\nFirst, calculate the difference in means:\n28.5 - 25.7 = 2.8 cm\n\nNext, compute the standard error (SE):\nSE = sqrt[(3.2\u00b2/15) + (3.5\u00b2/15)]\n= sqrt[(10.24/15) + (12.25/15)]\n= sqrt[(0.6827) + (0.8167)]\n= sqrt[1.4994]\n\u2248 1.2245 cm\n\nNow, calculate the t-statistic:\nt = 2.8 / 1.2245 \u2248 2.283\n\nNow, I need to compare this t-statistic to the critical value from the t-distribution table. Since it's a one-tailed test with \u03b1 = 0.05 and degrees of freedom (df) = n\u2081 + n\u2082 - 2 = 15 + 15 - 2 = 28.\n\nLooking up the t-critical value for df=28, one-tailed \u03b1=0.05. From the table, the critical value is approximately 1.312.\n\nOur calculated t-statistic is 2.283, which is greater than 1.312. This means that our observed difference is statistically significant at the 0.05 level.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to use a p-value approach, I would find the probability of observing a t-statistic as extreme as 2.283 under the null hypothesis. For df=28, this probability would be less than 0.05, which again leads us to reject H\u2080.\n\nTherefore, based on both the t-test statistic and the p-value, we have sufficient evidence at the 0.05 significance level to conclude that the new fertilizer increases tomato plant growth compared to the standard fertilizer.\n</think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation and Solution**\n\n1. **Define the Hypotheses:**\n   - **Null Hypothesis (H\u2080):** There is no difference in mean height between the two fertilizers. Mathematically, H\u2080: \u03bc\u2081 = \u03bc\u2082.\n   - **Alternative Hypothesis (H\u2081):** The new fertilizer increases the mean height. Mathematically, H\u2081: \u03bc\u2081 > \u03bc\u2082. This is a one-tailed test.\n\n2. **Determine the Appropriate Test:**\n   - Since the sample sizes are equal (15 each), a two-sample t-test is appropriate.\n\n3. **Calculate the Test Statistic:**\n   - **Difference in Means:** 28.5 cm (new fertilizer) - 25.7 cm (standard fertilizer) = 2.8 cm.\n   - **Standard Error (SE):**\n     SE = sqrt[(3.2\u00b2/15) + (3.5\u00b2/15)] \u2248 sqrt[0.6827 + 0.8167] \u2248 sqrt[1.4994] \u2248 1.2245 cm.\n   - **t-Statistic:** t = 2.8 / 1.2245 \u2248 2.283.\n\n4. **Determine the Critical Value:**\n   - Degrees of Freedom (df) = 15 + 15 - 2 = 28.\n   - For \u03b1 = 0.05 and one-tailed test, the critical t-value is approximately 1.312.\n\n5. **Compare the Test Statistic to the Critical Value:**\n   - Calculated t = 2.283 > Critical t = 1.312.\n   - Since the test statistic exceeds the critical value, we reject the null hypothesis.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - At the 0.05 significance level, there is sufficient evidence to conclude that the new fertilizer increases tomato plant growth compared to the standard fertilizer.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe researcher rejects the null hypothesis at the 0.05 significance level. Therefore, the new fertilizer does increase tomato plant growth compared to the standard fertilizer.\n\nDONE."

Then, based on the data provided, would you reject the null hypothesis at a significance level of 0.05? Explain your reasoning step by step. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to help solve this hypothesis testing problem. Let me start by understanding what the question is asking. A researcher is testing whether a new fertilizer increases tomato plant growth compared to a standard fertilizer. She's using 30 seedlings, splitting them evenly\u201415 for the new fertilizer and 15 for the standard one. After four weeks, she measures the height of each plant.\n\nThe data provided is:\n- New fertilizer: Mean height = 28.5 cm, Standard deviation = 3.2 cm\n- Standard fertilizer: Mean height = 25.7 cm, Standard deviation = 3.5 cm\n\nFirst, I need to formulate the null and alternative hypotheses. In hypothesis testing, the null hypothesis (H\u2080) usually represents the status quo or the default assumption, while the alternative (H\u2081 or H\u2090) is what we're trying to prove.\n\nSince the researcher is testing whether the new fertilizer increases growth, the alternative hypothesis is likely that the new fertilizer results in a higher mean height. That makes sense because if the new fertilizer is better, we'd expect the mean height to be greater than the standard.\n\nSo, the null hypothesis would state that the mean height of the new fertilizer group is equal to the mean height of the standard fertilizer group. The alternative would be that the new fertilizer's mean is greater than the standard.\n\nMathematically, that would be:\n- H\u2080: \u03bc\u2081 = \u03bc\u2082\n- H\u2090: \u03bc\u2081 > \u03bc\u2082\n\nWhere \u03bc\u2081 is the mean height with the new fertilizer and \u03bc\u2082 is the mean height with the standard fertilizer.\n\nNext, I need to decide whether to reject the null hypothesis at a significance level of 0.05. To do this, I should perform a hypothesis test. Since the data is about means and involves population variances that are unknown, I think a t-test would be appropriate here. But wait, the problem doesn't specify the population variances, so I might need to assume they're equal. If that's the case, I can use a two-sample t-test with equal variances.\n\nHowever, the problem gives standard deviations for each group. If variances are unequal, I should use a Welch's t-test instead. But without more information, it's safer to assume equal variances unless stated otherwise. So, I'll proceed with the two-sample t-test assuming equal variances.\n\nTo perform the t-test, I need to calculate the difference in means and then determine the standard error. Let's see:\n\nMean difference (\u03bc\u2081 - \u03bc\u2082) = 28.5 cm - 25.7 cm = 2.8 cm\n\nNext, the standard error (SE) for a two-sample t-test with equal variances is calculated as:\nSE = sqrt[(s\u2081\u00b2 + s\u2082\u00b2)/2] / sqrt(n)\nWhere s\u2081 and s\u2082 are the standard deviations, and n is the total number of observations.\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\ns\u2081 = 3.2 cm\ns\u2082 = 3.5 cm\nn = 30 (since there are 15 in each group)\n\nSo, SE = sqrt[(3.2\u00b2 + 3.5\u00b2)/2] / sqrt(30)\nFirst, calculate 3.2\u00b2 = 10.24\nThen, 3.5\u00b2 = 12.25\nAdding them: 10.24 + 12.25 = 22.49\nDivide by 2: 22.49 / 2 = 11.245\nTake square root: sqrt(11.245) \u2248 3.36\n\nThen divide by sqrt(30): sqrt(30) \u2248 5.477\nSo, SE \u2248 3.36 / 5.477 \u2248 0.615\n\nNow, the test statistic is the difference in means divided by the standard error:\nt = (\u03bc\u2081 - \u03bc\u2082) / SE = 2.8 / 0.615 \u2248 4.55\n\nNext, I need to find the critical t-value for a one-tailed test at \u03b1 = 0.05 with n = 30. Since we're assuming equal variances, I'll use the t-distribution with 29 degrees of freedom (since n-2 = 28, but wait, no\u2014degrees of freedom for two-sample t-test with equal variances is n - 2, so 30 - 2 = 28). Wait, no, actually, it's n - 2 for each group, but when variances are assumed equal, the degrees of freedom for the t-test is (n\u2081 + n\u2082 - 2), which is 30 - 2 = 28.\n\nLooking up the t-critical value for \u03b1 = 0.05, one-tailed, df = 28. Using a t-table or calculator, the critical value is approximately 1.312 (since for df=28, 0.05 one-tailed is about 1.31).\n\nOur calculated t-statistic is 4.55, which is much greater than 1.312. Therefore, it falls into the rejection region.\n\nAdditionally, I can compute the p-value associated with this t-statistic. The p-value is the probability of observing a t-statistic as extreme as 4.55, or more extreme, assuming the null hypothesis is true. Since our test is one-tailed (greater than \u03bc\u2082), the p-value is the probability that t \u2265 4.55. Using a t-distribution table or statistical software, the p-value is approximately 0.0003 (very small, less than 0.05).\n\nSince the p-value is less than the significance level \u03b1 = 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis. This suggests that the new fertilizer does indeed result in significantly greater tomato plant height compared to the standard fertilizer.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the degrees of freedom. I'm assuming equal variances, so the degrees of freedom for the two-sample t-test is n - 2, which is 30 - 2 = 28. That seems right.\n\nAlso, the standard error calculation: sqrt[(3.2\u00b2 + 3.5\u00b2)/2] / sqrt(30). Let me recalculate that:\n\n3.2\u00b2 = 10.24\n3.5\u00b2 = 12.25\nSum = 22.49\nDivide by 2 = 11.245\nSquare root = 3.36\nDivide by sqrt(30) \u2248 5.477\n3.36 / 5.477 \u2248 0.615\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAnd the t-statistic: 2.8 / 0.615 \u2248 4.55\n\nDegrees of freedom: 28\nCritical value at 0.05: ~1.312\nOur t is 4.55 > 1.312, so reject H\u2080.\n\nP-value: ~0.0003 < 0.05, so reject H\u2080.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is to reject the null hypothesis at the 0.05 significance level.\n</think>\n\nThe null hypothesis is that both fertilizers result in the same mean height, while the alternative is that the new fertilizer yields a greater height. Calculations show a significant difference (p < 0.05), so we reject the null.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Formulate Hypotheses:**\n   - **Null Hypothesis (H\u2080):** \u03bc\u2081 = \u03bc\u2082\n   - **Alternative Hypothesis (H\u2090):** \u03bc\u2081 > \u03bc\u2082\n\n2. **Determine Test Type:**\n   - Since we're comparing two population means with unknown variances, a two-sample t-test is appropriate.\n\n3. **Calculate the Test Statistic:**\n   - Mean difference (\u03bc\u2081 - \u03bc\u2082) = 28.5 - 25.7 = 2.8 cm\n   - Standard error (SE) = sqrt[(s\u2081\u00b2 + s\u2082\u00b2)/2]/sqrt(n) \u2248 0.615\n   - t-statistic = 2.8 / 0.615 \u2248 4.55\n\n4. **Determine Critical Value:**\n   - Degrees of freedom (df) = 28\n   - Critical t-value at \u03b1=0.05 \u2248 1.312\n\n5. **Evaluate Decision:**\n   - Calculated t = 4.55 > 1.312, so reject H\u2080.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - At the 0.05 significance level, there is sufficient evidence to conclude that the new fertilizer increases tomato plant growth.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe researcher should reject the null hypothesis at the .05 significance level. The data suggests that the new fertilizer significantly increases tomato plant height compared to the standard fertilizer.\n\nDONE."

Then, based on the data provided, would you reject the null hypothesis at a significance level of 0.05? Explain your reasoning step by step. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I need to help the researcher figure out whether the new fertilizer is actually increasing tomato plant growth compared to the standard fertilizer. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when testing two groups like this, we usually use a t-test because the population variances might be unknown, and the sample sizes are small. But I should check if the population variances can be assumed equal. The problem doesn't mention population variances, but in many experiments, especially with similar treatments, we often assume equal variances. However, since the standard deviations given are for the sample (15 plants each), I think it's safer to use a t-test assuming unequal variances, just in case.\n\nSo, the null hypothesis (H\u2080) would be that there's no difference in the mean height between the two fertilizers. That means the two means are equal. In mathematical terms, that's H\u2080: \u03bc\u2081 = \u03bc\u2082, where \u03bc\u2081 is the mean height with the new fertilizer and \u03bc\u2082 is the mean with the standard fertilizer.\n\nThe alternative hypothesis (H\u2081) is that the new fertilizer increases the mean height, so we're testing if there's a significant difference where the new fertilizer mean is greater than the standard one. So, H\u2081: \u03bc\u2081 > \u03bc\u2082.\n\nNext, I need to decide on the significance level. The problem specifies 0.05, which is common in many experiments because it's a reasonable balance between the risk of false positives and the statistical power.\n\nNow, to determine whether to reject the null hypothesis, I need to calculate the test statistic and compare it to the critical value or use a p-value approach. Since the sample sizes are 15 each, the degrees of freedom for the t-test would be 15 + 15 - 1 = 29. But wait, if I'm using a pooled variance t-test (assuming unequal variances), the degrees of freedom would be 29. If I assume equal variances, it would be 29 as well, but the test statistic calculation changes.\n\nLet me calculate the means first. The new fertilizer group has a mean of 28.5 cm, and the standard one has 25.7 cm. So the difference in means is 28.5 - 25.7 = 2.8 cm. The standard error (SE) would be sqrt[(s\u2081\u00b2 + s\u2082\u00b2)/2], but wait, that's for the pooled variance. Alternatively, if I use the Welch's t-test for unequal variances, the SE is sqrt[(s\u2081\u00b2/n\u2081 + s\u2082\u00b2/n\u2082)].\n\nSo, s\u2081 is 3.2 cm, s\u2082 is 3.5 cm, n\u2081 and n\u2082 are both 15. Let me plug those in:\n\nSE = sqrt[(3.2\u00b2/15 + 3.5\u00b2/15)] = sqrt[(10.24 + 12.25)/15] = sqrt[(22.49)/15] \u2248 sqrt(1.497) \u2248 1.224.\n\nThen, the test statistic t = (difference in means) / SE = 2.8 / 1.224 \u2248 2.289.\n\nNow, I need to compare this t-value to the critical value from the t-distribution with 29 degrees of freedom at \u03b1=0.05. Looking up the t-table, the critical value for one-tailed test (since we're testing for a greater mean) with 29 degrees of freedom is about 1.699.\n\nSince 2.289 > 1.699, we would reject the null hypothesis at the 0.05 significance level. This suggests that the new fertilizer does indeed result in significantly greater plant height compared to the standard fertilizer.\n\nAlternatively, I could calculate the p-value associated with t=2.289 and df=29. Using a t-distribution calculator, the p-value is approximately 0.012. Since 0.012 < 0.05, we again reject the null hypothesis.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the hypotheses are H\u2080: \u03bc\u2081 = \u03bc\u2082 vs. H\u2081: \u03bc\u2081 > \u03bc\u2082. The calculated t-statistic is 2.289, which is significant at the 0.05 level, leading us to reject H\u2080 in favor of H\u2081.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether the new fertilizer increases tomato plant growth compared to the standard fertilizer, we formulate the following hypotheses:\n\n- **Null Hypothesis (H\u2080):** There is no difference in the mean height between the two fertilizers.  \n  Mathematically, H\u2080: \u03bc\u2081 = \u03bc\u2082\n\n- **Alternative Hypothesis (H\u2081):** The new fertilizer increases the mean height.  \n  Mathematically, H\u2081: \u03bc\u2081 > \u03bc\u2082\n\nNext, we perform a t-test to compare the means. The calculated t-statistic is 2.289, and the critical value for a one-tailed test at \u03b1=0.05 with 29 degrees of freedom is 1.699. Since 2.289 > 1.699, we reject the null hypothesis.\n\n**Conclusion:** At a 0.05 significance level, we have sufficient evidence to conclude that the new fertilizer increases tomato plant growth.\n\nDONE."

After 4 weeks, she measures the height (in cm) of each plant. The plants with the new fertilizer have a mean height of 28.5 cm with a standard deviation of 3.2 cm, while the plants with the standard fertilizer have a mean height of 25.7 cm with a standard deviation of 3.5 cm.\n\nFormulate appropriate null and alternative hypotheses for this experiment. Then, based on the data provided, would you reject the null hypothesis at a significance level of 0.05? Explain your reasoning step by step. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I need to help the researcher figure out whether the new fertilizer is actually increasing tomato plant growth compared to the standard one. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that in hypothesis testing, we start by formulating the null and alternative hypotheses. The null hypothesis usually represents the status quo or what we would expect without the new treatment, while the alternative is what we are trying to prove.\n\nSince the researcher is comparing the new fertilizer to the standard one, I think we should set up a two-tailed test. That makes sense because the new fertilizer could either increase or decrease growth compared to the standard, so we need to check both possibilities.\n\nOkay, so let's denote the population mean height of the plants as \u03bc. The new fertilizer group has a sample mean of 28.5 cm, and the standard fertilizer group has a sample mean of 25.7 cm. Since we're dealing with two groups, we'll use an independent samples t-test.\n\nThe null hypothesis, H\u2080, would be that the mean height of the new fertilizer group is equal to the mean height of the standard fertilizer group. So, mathematically, that's:\n\nH\u2080: \u03bc\u2081 = \u03bc\u2082\n\nWhere \u03bc\u2081 is the mean height with the new fertilizer and \u03bc\u2082 is the mean height with the standard fertilizer.\n\nThe alternative hypothesis, H\u2081, is that there's a difference between the two means. Specifically, we're looking for a difference greater than zero. So:\n\nH\u2081: \u03bc\u2081 \u2260 \u03bc\u2082\n\nAlright, so now I have my hypotheses set up. Next, I need to decide on a significance level, which is given as 0.05. This means we'll reject the null hypothesis if our test statistic falls into the rejection region corresponding to a 5% significance level.\n\nNow, to conduct the test, I need to calculate the appropriate test statistic. Since this is a two-tailed test, I'll need to find the t-statistic for the difference in means, taking into account the sample sizes and standard deviations.\n\nThe formula for the t-statistic in an independent samples t-test is:\n\nt = (\u03bc\u2081 - \u03bc\u2082) / sqrt[(s\u2081\u00b2/n\u2081) + (s\u2082\u00b2/n\u2082)]\n\nWhere:\n- \u03bc\u2081 and \u03bc\u2082 are the sample means\n- s\u2081 and s\u2082 are the sample standard deviations\n- n\u2081 and n\u2082 are the sample sizes\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n\u03bc\u2081 = 28.5 cm\n\u03bc\u2082 = 25.7 cm\ns\u2081 = 3.2 cm\ns\u2082 = 3.5 cm\nn\u2081 = n\u2082 = 15\n\nSo, let's compute the numerator first: 28.5 - 25.7 = 2.8 cm\n\nNow, the denominator: sqrt[(3.2\u00b2/15) + (3.5\u00b2/15)]\n\nCalculating each part:\n\n3.2\u00b2 = 10.24\n3.5\u00b2 = 12.25\n\nSo,\n\n10.24 / 15 = 0.6816\n12.25 / 15 = 0.8167\n\nAdding these together: 0.6816 + 0.8167 = 1.4983\n\nTaking the square root: sqrt(1.4983) \u2248 1.2247\n\nSo, the t-statistic is 2.8 / 1.2247 \u2248 2.277\n\nNow, I need to find the critical t-value for a two-tailed test at \u03b1 = 0.05. Since this is a two-tailed test, I'll need to look up the t-values for 0.025 in each tail.\n\nLooking up in the t-table, for a two-tailed test with \u03b1=0.05, the critical t-value is approximately \u00b12.262.\n\nOur calculated t-statistic is approximately 2.277, which is greater than 2.262. \n\nSince our t-statistic falls into the rejection region, we reject the null hypothesis. This means that the difference in means is statistically significant at the 0.05 level, suggesting that the new fertilizer does increase tomato plant growth compared to the standard fertilizer.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any errors. \n\nCalculating the denominator again:\n\ns\u2081\u00b2 = 3.2\u00b2 = 10.24\ns\u2082\u00b2 = 3.5\u00b2 = 12.25\n\nThen, 10.24 / 15 = 0.6816\n12.25 / 15 = 0.8167\n\nAdding them: 0.6816 + 0.8167 = 1.4983\nSquare root: sqrt(1.4983) \u2248 1.2247\n\nSo, t = 2.8 / 1.2247 \u2248 2.277\n\nYes, that's correct. And the critical t-value is indeed around 2.262. Since 2.277 is greater than 2.262, we reject H\u2080.\n\nSo, the conclusion is that we have sufficient evidence at the 0.05 significance level to conclude that the new fertilizer increases tomato plant growth compared to the standard fertilizer.\n</think>\n\nThe researcher wants to test whether the new fertilizer increases tomato plant growth. The hypotheses are:\n\n- **Null Hypothesis (H\u2080):** The mean height of plants with the new fertilizer is equal to the mean height of plants with the standard fertilizer.\n  \n  H\u2080: \u03bc\u2081 = \u03bc\u2082\n\n- **Alternative Hypothesis (H\u2081):** The mean height differs between the two groups.\n\n  H\u2081: \u03bc\u2081 \u2260 \u03bc\u2082\n\nTo determine if we reject H\u2080, we calculate the t-statistic:\n\nt = (28.5 - 25.7) / sqrt[(3.2\u00b2/15) + (3.5\u00b2/15)] \u2248 2.277\n\nThe critical t-value for a two-tailed test at \u03b1 = 0.05 is \u00b12.262. Since 2.277 > 2.262, we reject H\u2080.\n\n**Conclusion:** Reject the null hypothesis. The new fertilizer significantly increases tomato plant growth.\n\nDONE."

End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: A researcher wants to test whether a new fertilizer increases tomato plant growth compared to a standard fertilizer. She selects 30 tomato seedlings of the same variety and randomly assigns 15 to receive the new fertilizer and 15 to receive the standard fertilizer. After 4 weeks, she measures the height (in cm) of each plant. The plants with the new fertilizer have a mean height of 28.5 cm with a standard deviation of 3.2 cm, while the plants with the standard fertilizer have a mean height of 25.7 cm with a standard deviation of 3.5 cm.\n\nFormulate appropriate null and alternative hypotheses for this experiment. Then, based on the data provided, would you reject the null hypothesis at a significance level of 0.05? Explain your reasoning step by step. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out how to help this researcher test whether the new fertilizer is better than the standard one for tomato plants. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the researcher has 30 tomato seedlings. She splits them into two groups of 15 each. One group gets the new fertilizer, and the other gets the standard one. After four weeks, she measures the height of each plant. The new fertilizer group has a mean height of 28.5 cm with a standard deviation of 3.2 cm. The standard fertilizer group has a mean height of 25.7 cm with a standard deviation of 3.5 cm.\n\nOkay, so the question is about formulating the null and alternative hypotheses and then determining whether to reject the null at a 0.05 significance level.\n\nLet me recall what null and alternative hypotheses are. The null hypothesis (H\u2080) is usually the statement that there's no effect, or no difference between the groups. The alternative hypothesis (H\u2081 or H\u2090) is what we're trying to prove, often that there is an effect or difference.\n\nIn this case, the researcher wants to test if the new fertilizer increases growth. So, the alternative hypothesis should reflect that the new fertilizer has a greater mean height than the standard one. That makes sense.\n\nSo, mathematically, the null hypothesis would be that the mean height of the new fertilizer group is equal to the mean height of the standard fertilizer group. The alternative hypothesis is that the new fertilizer's mean is greater than the standard one.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nH\u2080: \u03bc_new = \u03bc_standard  \nH\u2081: \u03bc_new > \u03bc_standard\n\nYes, that seems right. It's a one-tailed test because we're only interested in whether the new fertilizer increases growth, not whether it decreases it or has no effect.\n\nNext, the researcher has the sample means and standard deviations for both groups. To determine whether to reject the null hypothesis, she needs to perform a hypothesis test. The appropriate test here would be a t-test for independent groups since the two fertilizers are applied to different groups.\n\nThe formula for the t-statistic is:\n\nt = (\u03bc_new - \u03bc_standard) / sqrt( (\u03c3_new\u00b2 / n_new) + (\u03c3_standard\u00b2 / n_standard) )\n\nWhere:\n- \u03bc_new and \u03bc_standard are the sample means\n- \u03c3_new and \u03c3_standard are the sample standard deviations\n- n_new and n_standard are the sample sizes (both are 15 here)\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers:\n\n\u03bc_new = 28.5 cm  \n\u03bc_standard = 25.7 cm  \n\u03c3_new = 3.2 cm  \n\u03c3_standard = 3.5 cm  \nn_new = 15  \nn_standard = 15\n\nCalculating the denominator first:\n\nsqrt( (3.2\u00b2 / 15) + (3.5\u00b2 / 15) )  \n= sqrt( (10.24 / 15) + (12.25 / 15) )  \n= sqrt( (22.49 / 15) )  \n= sqrt(1.4967)  \n\u2248 1.223\n\nSo, the t-statistic is:\n\nt = (28.5 - 25.7) / 1.223  \n= 2.8 / 1.223  \n\u2248 2.296\n\nNow, to determine whether this t-statistic is significant at the 0.05 level, I need to compare it to the critical t-value from the t-distribution table.\n\nSince the sample sizes are equal (n = 15 for both groups), the degrees of freedom (df) is 15 + 15 = 30. For a one-tailed test at 0.05 significance level, the critical t-value with df = 30 is approximately 1.699.\n\nOur calculated t-statistic is 2.296, which is greater than 1.699. Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis at the 0.05 level.\n\nThis means that there is a statistically significant difference in the mean heights between the two fertilizer treatments, suggesting that the new fertilizer does indeed increase tomato plant growth compared to the standard fertilizer.\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. **Formulate the Hypotheses:**\n   - **Null Hypothesis (H\u2080):** The mean height of the new fertilizer group is equal to the mean height of the standard fertilizer group.\n     \\[\n     H_0: \\mu_{\\text{new}} = \\mu_{\\text{standard}}\n     \\]\n   - **Alternative Hypothesis (H\u2081):** The mean height of the new fertilizer group is greater than the mean height of the standard fertilizer group.\n     \\[\n     H_1: \\mu_{\\text{new}} > \\mu_{\\text{standard}}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Determine the Appropriate Test:**\n   - Since the two groups are independent and the population standard deviations are unknown, a **t-test for independent groups** is suitable.\n\n3. **Calculate the t-Statistic:**\n   - Formula:\n     \\[\n     t = \\frac{\\bar{x}_{\\text{new}} - \\bar{x}_{\\text{standard}}}{\\sqrt{\\frac{s_{\\text{new}}^2}{n_{\\text{new}}} + \\frac{s_{\\text{standard}}^2}{n_{\\text{standard}}}}}\n     \\]\n   - Plugging in the values:\n     \\[\n     t = \\frac{28.5 - 25.7}{\\sqrt{\\frac{3.2^2}{15} + \\frac{3.5^2}{15}}} = \\frac{2.8}{\\sqrt{1.4967}} \\approx 2.296\n     \\]\n\n4. **Determine the Critical t-Value:**\n   - Degrees of freedom (df) = 15 + 15 = 30.\n   - For a one-tailed test at \u03b1 = 0.05, the critical t-value is approximately 1.699.\n\n5. **Make a Decision:**\n   - Since the calculated t-statistic (2.296) > critical t-value (1.699), **reject the null hypothesis**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAt a 0.05 significance level, we reject the null hypothesis.

Then, based on the data provided, would you reject the null hypothesis at a significance level of 0.05? Explain your reasoning step by step. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem where a researcher is testing a new fertilizer against a standard one for tomato plants. She used 30 seedlings, splitting them into two groups of 15 each. The new fertilizer group has a mean height of 28.5 cm with a standard deviation of 3.2 cm, while the standard fertilizer group has a mean height of 25.7 cm with a standard deviation of 3.5 cm. I need to figure out the appropriate null and alternative hypotheses, and then decide whether to reject the null at a 0.05 significance level.\n\nFirst, I remember that in hypothesis testing, the null hypothesis is usually the statement of equality, and the alternative is what we're trying to prove. Since the researcher is comparing two fertilizers, the null hypothesis should be that the mean height of the new fertilizer is equal to the mean height of the standard fertilizer. So, H\u2080: \u03bc\u2081 = \u03bc\u2082, where \u03bc\u2081 is the mean height with the new fertilizer and \u03bc\u2082 is with the standard.\n\nThe alternative hypothesis would then be that the new fertilizer increases growth, so H\u2081: \u03bc\u2081 > \u03bc\u2082. I think this is a one-tailed test because we're only interested in whether the new fertilizer is better, not worse or the same.\n\nNext, I need to determine the type of test to use. Since we're comparing two independent groups, a t-test would be appropriate here. But wait, with 30 plants, each group has 15, so the sample sizes are equal. I recall that when the sample sizes are equal, we can use a pooled variance t-test, which combines the variances from both groups to get a more precise standard error.\n\nLet me calculate the pooled variance. The formula is (n\u2081 + n\u2082 - 2) * s_p\u00b2, where s_p\u00b2 is the combined variance. First, calculate the variances for each group. For the new fertilizer, variance is (3.2)\u00b2 = 10.24, and for the standard, it's (3.5)\u00b2 = 12.25. The total number of observations is 30, so n\u2081 + n\u2082 = 30. The degrees of freedom for the pooled variance would be 30 - 2 = 28.\n\nCalculating s_p\u00b2: (30 - 2) * (10.24 + 12.25) / 30 = 28 * 22.49 / 30. Let me compute that: 28 * 22.49 = 631.72, divided by 30 gives approximately 21.057. So s_p\u00b2 is about 21.057.\n\nNow, the standard error (SE) is the square root of that, which is sqrt(21.057) \u2248 4.589.\n\nNext, the test statistic is (\u03bc\u2081 - \u03bc\u2082) / SE. Plugging in the numbers: (28.5 - 25.7) / 4.589 \u2248 2.8 / 4.589 \u2248 0.612.\n\nNow, I need to compare this test statistic to the critical value from the t-distribution. Since it's a one-tailed test with \u03b1 = 0.05 and degrees of freedom = 28, I'll look up the t-critical value. Using a t-table or calculator, for df=28 and \u03b1=0.05, the critical t-value is approximately 1.312.\n\nComparing 0.612 to 1.312. Since 0.612 < 1.312, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. Therefore, there's not enough evidence at the 0.05 level to conclude that the new fertilizer increases growth compared to the standard.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused. Did I do the pooled variance correctly? Let me double-check. The formula is indeed (n\u2081 + n\u2082 - 2) * s\u2081\u00b2 * n\u2081 + (n\u2082 + n\u2081 - 2) * s\u2082\u00b2 * n\u2082 / (n\u2081 + n\u2082). Wait, no, that's not right. The correct formula is (n\u2081 + n\u2082 - 2) * (s\u2081\u00b2 * n\u2081 + s\u2082\u00b2 * n\u2082) / (n\u2081 + n\u2082). So, plugging in the numbers: (15 + 15 - 2) * (10.24*15 + 12.25*15) / 30. That's 28 * (153.6 + 183.75) / 30 = 28 * 337.35 / 30. 28 * 337.35 = 9,443.9, divided by 30 is approximately 31.46. So s_p\u00b2 is 31.46, and SE is sqrt(31.46) \u2248 5.61.\n\nWait, that's different from what I did earlier. I think I messed up the calculation. Let me recalculate correctly. So the correct pooled variance is (n\u2081 + n\u2082 - 2) * (s\u2081\u00b2 * n\u2081 + s\u2082\u00b2 * n\u2082) / (n\u2081 + n\u2082). So that's (30 - 2) * (10.24*15 + 12.25*15)/30 = 28 * (153.6 + 183.75)/30 = 28 * 337.35 /30 = 28 * 11.245 \u2248 316.06. Wait, no, 337.35 /30 is approximately 11.245, then 28 * 11.245 \u2248 316.06. So s_p\u00b2 \u2248 316.06, SE \u2248 sqrt(316.06) \u2248 17.78.\n\nWait, that can't be right because the standard deviations were 3.2 and 3.5, and the sample sizes are 15 each. Let me check the correct formula again. Oh, I think I made a mistake in the formula. The correct formula is s_p\u00b2 = [(n\u2081 - 1)s\u2081\u00b2 + (n\u2082 - 1)s\u2082\u00b2]/(n\u2081 + n\u2082 - 2). So, plugging in: (14*10.24 + 14*12.25)/28 = (144.96 + 171)/28 = 315.96 /28 \u2248 11.25. So s_p\u00b2 \u2248 11.25, SE \u2248 sqrt(11.25) \u2248 3.354.\n\nOkay, that makes more sense. So the test statistic is (28.5 - 25.7)/3.354 \u2248 2.8 /3.354 \u2248 0.832.\n\nNow, comparing to the critical t-value of 1.312. Since 0.832 < 1.312, we still fail to reject the null. Therefore, at 0.05 significance level, we don't have enough evidence to say the new fertilizer significantly increases growth.\n\nI think I initially messed up the pooled variance formula, which led to an incorrect SE. After correcting, the SE is about 3.354, and the test statistic is 0.832, which is less than 1.312, so no rejection.\n\nSo, to sum up, the null hypothesis is that both fertilizers have equal mean heights, and the alternative is that the new one is higher. After calculating the test statistic and comparing it to the critical value, we don't reject the null, meaning we can't conclude that the new fertilizer is better at the 0.05 level.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether to reject the null hypothesis, we perform a t-test for independent groups with equal sample sizes using the pooled variance.\n\n1. **Hypotheses**:\n   - Null: \u03bc\u2081 = \u03bc\u2082\n   - Alternative: \u03bc\u2081 > \u03bc\u2082\n\n2. **Test Statistic**:\n   - Calculated test statistic: t \u2248 0.832\n\n3. **Critical Value**:\n   - For \u03b1 = 0.05 and df = 28, the critical t-value is 1.312.\n\n4. **Decision**:\n   - Since 0.832 < 1.312, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.\n\n**Conclusion**: There is not enough evidence at the 0.05 significance level to conclude that the new fertilizer increases tomato plant growth compared to the standard fertilizer.\n\nDONE."

After 4 weeks, she measures the height (in cm) of each plant.

Then, based on the data provided, would you reject the null hypothesis at a significance level of 0.05? Explain your reasoning step by step. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to help this researcher figure out whether the new fertilizer is actually increasing tomato plant growth compared to the standard fertilizer. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that in hypothesis testing, we usually set up a null hypothesis (H\u2080) and an alternative hypothesis (H\u2081 or H\u2090). The null hypothesis is what we assume to be true unless our data shows otherwise. The alternative hypothesis is what we are trying to prove.\n\nIn this case, the researcher is comparing two fertilizers. She has 30 tomato seedlings, splitting them into two groups of 15. One group gets the new fertilizer, and the other gets the standard one. After four weeks, she measures the height of each plant.\n\nSo, the question is whether the new fertilizer increases growth. That means our alternative hypothesis should reflect an increase in height. Since we're dealing with means, I think we'll use the population mean as our parameter.\n\nLet me define the variables:\n- Let \u03bc\u2081 be the true mean height of plants with the new fertilizer.\n- Let \u03bc\u2082 be the true mean height of plants with the standard fertilizer.\n\nUnder the null hypothesis, we assume that both fertilizers have the same true mean height. So, H\u2080: \u03bc\u2081 = \u03bc\u2082.\n\nThe alternative hypothesis is that the new fertilizer increases the mean height, so H\u2081: \u03bc\u2081 > \u03bc\u2082.\n\nOkay, that makes sense. Now, the next part is figuring out whether to reject the null hypothesis based on the given data.\n\nThe researcher has measured the heights. For the new fertilizer group:\n- Mean (x\u0304\u2081) = 28.5 cm\n- Standard deviation (s\u2081) = 3.2 cm\n\nFor the standard fertilizer group:\n- Mean (x\u0304\u2082) = 25.7 cm\n- Standard deviation (s\u2082) = 3.5 cm\n\nShe has 15 plants in each group, so each sample size is 15. \n\nI remember that when comparing two independent groups, we can use a t-test. Specifically, the two-sample t-test for independent means. The test statistic is calculated as:\n\nt = (x\u0304\u2081 - x\u0304\u2082) / sqrt[(s\u2081\u00b2/n\u2081) + (s\u2082\u00b2/n\u2082)]\n\nWhere:\n- n\u2081 and n\u2082 are the sample sizes (both 15 here)\n- s\u2081 and s\u2082 are the sample standard deviations\n- x\u0304\u2081 and x\u0304\u2082 are the sample means\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n- x\u0304\u2081 = 28.5\n- x\u0304\u2082 = 25.7\n- s\u2081 = 3.2\n- s\u2082 = 3.5\n- n\u2081 = n\u2082 = 15\n\nFirst, calculate the difference in means: 28.5 - 25.7 = 2.8 cm\n\nNext, compute the standard error (SE):\nSE = sqrt[(3.2\u00b2/15) + (3.5\u00b2/15)]\nLet me compute each part:\n- 3.2\u00b2 = 10.24\n- 10.24 / 15 \u2248 0.681\n- 3.5\u00b2 = 12.25\n- 12.25 / 15 \u2248 0.817\n\nAdding those: 0.681 + 0.817 \u2248 1.498\nSo, SE \u2248 sqrt(1.498) \u2248 1.224\n\nNow, the t-statistic:\nt = 2.8 / 1.224 \u2248 2.286\n\nNext, I need to determine the degrees of freedom (df). Since the population standard deviations are unknown, we use the Welch's t-test, which is appropriate when the variances are not equal. The formula for degrees of freedom is:\n\ndf = ( (s\u2081\u00b2/n\u2081 + s\u2082\u00b2/n\u2082)\u00b2 ) / ( (s\u2081\u00b2/n\u2081)\u00b2/(n\u2081-1) + (s\u2082\u00b2/n\u2082)\u00b2/(n\u2082-1) )\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n- s\u2081\u00b2/n\u2081 = 10.24 / 15 \u2248 0.681\n- s\u2082\u00b2/n\u2082 = 12.25 / 15 \u2248 0.817\n\nSo, the numerator is (0.681 + 0.817)\u00b2 = (1.498)\u00b2 \u2248 2.241\n\nThe denominator is:\n(0.681\u00b2 / 14) + (0.817\u00b2 / 14)\nCompute each:\n- 0.681\u00b2 \u2248 0.464\n- 0.464 / 14 \u2248 0.0331\n- 0.817\u00b2 \u2248 0.667\n- 0.667 / 14 \u2248 0.0476\n\nAdding them: 0.0331 + 0.0476 \u2248 0.0807\n\nSo, df \u2248 2.241 / 0.0807 \u2248 27.83\n\nSince degrees of freedom must be a whole number, we round to 27 or 28. I think it's common to round to the nearest integer, so let's say 27.83 rounds to 28.\n\nNow, we need to compare our calculated t-statistic (\u22482.286) to the critical t-value from the t-distribution table with 28 degrees of freedom at \u03b1 = 0.05.\n\nLooking up the t-table, for one-tailed test (since we're testing if the means are greater, not both sides), and df=28, the critical t-value is approximately 1.312.\n\nOur calculated t is 2.286, which is greater than 1.312. Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis at the 0.05 significance level.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the degrees of freedom calculation. Maybe I made a mistake there.\n\nAnother way to compute df for Welch's t-test:\ndf = [ (s\u2081\u00b2/n\u2081 + s\u2082\u00b2/n\u2082)\u00b2 ] / [ (s\u2081\u00b2/n\u2081)\u00b2/(n\u2081-1) + (s\u2082\u00b2/n\u2082)\u00b2/(n\u2082-1) ]\n\nPlugging in:\nNumerator: (0.681 + 0.817)\u00b2 = (1.498)\u00b2 \u2248 2.241\n\nDenominator:\n(0.681\u00b2 /14) + (0.817\u00b2 /14) \u2248 (0.464 + 0.667)/14 \u2248 1.131/14 \u2248 0.081\n\nSo, df \u2248 2.241 / 0.081 \u2248 27.74, which is about 27.74. So, still around 28 degrees of freedom.\n\nGiven that, the t-value is higher than the critical value, so we reject H\u2080.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using a two-tailed test? Wait, no. Since we're only testing if the new fertilizer is better, not worse, it's a one-tailed test.\n\nSo, yes, with the t-statistic of 2.286 and critical t of 1.312, we reject H\u2080.\n</think>\n\nThe researcher sets up a two-group hypothesis test to compare the mean height of tomato plants treated with the new fertilizer versus the standard fertilizer. The null hypothesis is that both treatments have equal mean heights, and the alternative is that the new fertilizer increases the mean height.\n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. **Hypotheses:**\n   - Null hypothesis (H\u2080): \u03bc\u2081 = \u03bc\u2082\n   - Alternative hypothesis (H\u2081): \u03bc\u2081 > \u03bc\u2082\n\n2. **Test Statistic:**\n   - Calculated t-statistic \u2248 2.286\n   - Degrees of freedom \u2248 28\n   - Critical t-value (one-tailed, \u03b1=0.05) \u2248 1.312\n\n3. **Decision:**\n   - Since the calculated t-statistic (2.286) > critical t-value (1.312), we reject the null hypothesis at the 0.05 significance level.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThere is sufficient evidence to conclude that the new fertilizer increases tomato plant growth compared to the standard fertilizer.\n\nDONE."

She selects 30 tomato seedlings of the same variety and randomly assigns 15 to receive the new fertilizer and 15 to receive the standard fertilizer. After 4 weeks, she measures the height (in cm) of each plant. The plants with the new fertilizer have a mean height of 28.5 cm with a standard deviation of 3.2 cm, while the plants with the standard fertilizer have a mean height of 25.7 cm with a standard deviation of 3.5 cm.\n\nFormulate appropriate null and alternative hypotheses for this experiment. Then, based on the data provided, would you reject the null hypothesis at a significance level of 0.05? Explain your reasoning step by step. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this problem where a researcher is testing whether a new fertilizer increases tomato plant growth compared to a standard fertilizer. She used 30 tomato seedlings, splitting them into two groups of 15. One group got the new fertilizer, and the other got the standard one. After four weeks, she measured the height of each plant. The new fertilizer group had a mean height of 28.5 cm with a standard deviation of 3.2 cm, while the standard fertilizer group had a mean height of 25.7 cm with a standard deviation of 3.5 cm.\n\nOkay, I need to help her set up the appropriate null and alternative hypotheses for this experiment. Then, based on the data, determine whether to reject the null hypothesis at a significance level of 0.05.\n\nFirst, let's recall what null and alternative hypotheses are. The null hypothesis (H\u2080) represents the status quo or the default assumption that there's no effect. In this case, the researcher wants to test if the new fertilizer has a different effect than the standard one. So, I think the null hypothesis would be that the mean height of the new fertilizer group is equal to the mean height of the standard fertilizer group.\n\nThe alternative hypothesis (H\u2081) is what the researcher is trying to prove. Since the researcher is testing if the new fertilizer increases growth, the alternative hypothesis would be that the mean height of the new fertilizer group is greater than that of the standard one.\n\nSo, H\u2080: \u03bc\u2081 = \u03bc\u2082  \nH\u2081: \u03bc\u2081 > \u03bc\u2082\n\nHere, \u03bc\u2081 is the population mean height for the new fertilizer group, and \u03bc\u2082 is the population mean height for the standard fertilizer group.\n\nNow, to determine whether to reject the null hypothesis, I need to perform a hypothesis test. Since this is a comparison of two independent means, I should use an independent t-test. The test statistic is calculated as t = (\u03bc\u2081 - \u03bc\u2082) / sqrt(\u03c3\u2081\u00b2/p\u2081 + \u03c3\u2082\u00b2/p\u2082), where \u03c3\u2081 and \u03c3\u2082 are the standard deviations, and p\u2081 and p\u2082 are the sample sizes (which are both 15 in this case).\n\nLet me plug in the numbers:\n\n\u03bc\u2081 = 28.5 cm  \n\u03bc\u2082 = 25.7 cm  \n\u03c3\u2081 = 3.2 cm  \n\u03c3\u2082 = 3.5 cm  \np\u2081 = p\u2082 = 15\n\nSo, the denominator would be sqrt((3.2\u00b2)/15 + (3.5\u00b2)/15). Let me compute that:\n\n3.2\u00b2 = 10.24  \n3.5\u00b2 = 12.25  \n\nSo, 10.24/15 + 12.25/15 = (10.24 + 12.25)/15 = 22.49/15 \u2248 1.497\n\nThen the square root of 1.497 is approximately 1.224.\n\nSo, the test statistic t = (28.5 - 25.7)/1.224 \u2248 2.8 / 1.224 \u2248 2.298.\n\nNow, I need to compare this t-value to the critical value from the t-distribution table. Since this is a one-tailed test (H\u2081: \u03bc\u2081 > \u03bc\u2082), we'll use the t\u2080.05, 29 degrees of freedom (since 30 - 2 = 28, wait no, actually, for two groups, the degrees of freedom is total samples minus 2, so 30 - 2 = 28). Wait, no, actually, for independent t-test, the degrees of freedom is n - 2, which is 30 - 2 = 28.\n\nLooking up t\u2080.05, 28 degrees of freedom, which is approximately 2.842.\n\nOur calculated t-value is 2.298, which is less than 2.842. Therefore, we do not reject the null hypothesis at the 0.05 significance level.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the degrees of freedom. For an independent t-test, degrees of freedom is indeed n - 2, where n is the total number of samples, which is 30. So, 30 - 2 = 28. So that part is correct.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes people use n for two groups, but no, it should be n - 2 for independent samples. So, 28 degrees of freedom is correct.\n\nAlso, the calculation for the standard error: sqrt((10.24 + 12.25)/15) \u2248 sqrt(22.49/15) \u2248 sqrt(1.497) \u2248 1.224. That seems right.\n\nAnd the difference in means is 28.5 - 25.7 = 2.8 cm. So, 2.8 / 1.224 \u2248 2.298.\n\nLooking up the critical t-value for one-tailed test at 0.05 with 28 degrees of freedom, it's indeed around 2.842.\n\nSince 2.298 < 2.842, we fail to reject H\u2080. So, there's not enough evidence to conclude that the new fertilizer increases plant height at the 0.05 significance level.\n\nI think that's it. So, the conclusion is to not reject the null hypothesis.\n</think>\n\nThe researcher sets up the hypotheses as follows:\n\n- Null hypothesis (H\u2080): \u03bc\u2081 = \u03bc\u2082  \n- Alternative hypothesis (H\u2081): \u03bc\u2081 > \u03bc\u2082\n\nUsing an independent t-test with a significance level of 0.05, the calculated t-value is approximately 2.298, which is less than the critical t-value of 2.842. Therefore, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe null hypothesis is not rejected.  \nDONE."

Then, based on the data provided, would you reject the null hypothesis at a significance level of 0.05? Explain your reasoning step by step. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I need to help the researcher with her hypothesis testing. Let's see what she's doing. She's comparing two fertilizers on tomato plant growth. She's using 30 seedlings, splitting them into two groups of 15. One group gets the new fertilizer, and the other gets the standard one. After four weeks, she measures the height of each plant.\n\nOkay, first thing first, I need to figure out the null and alternative hypotheses. In hypothesis testing, the null hypothesis usually represents the status quo or what we expect without the new treatment. The alternative hypothesis is what we're trying to prove or disprove.\n\nSo, the null hypothesis, H0, would likely state that there's no difference in mean height between the two fertilizers. That makes sense because she wants to see if the new fertilizer actually makes a difference. So, H0: \u03bc_new = \u03bc_standard.\n\nNow, the alternative hypothesis, H1, is the opposite. She's testing if the new fertilizer increases growth, so H1 would be that the mean height of the new fertilizer is greater than the standard one. So, H1: \u03bc_new > \u03bc_standard.\n\nGot that down. Now, she has the data: the new fertilizer group has a mean height of 28.5 cm with a standard deviation of 3.2 cm, and the standard fertilizer group has a mean of 25.7 cm with a standard deviation of 3.5 cm.\n\nNext step is to perform a hypothesis test. Since the means are the main focus here, we'll probably use a t-test, especially since the population standard deviations might be unknown or the sample sizes are small. Wait, but she has 15 in each group, which is a decent sample size. Maybe a z-test could work, but t-test is more accurate for small samples. Hmm, but the question doesn't specify, so I think using the t-test is appropriate here.\n\nAlright, so the test statistic would be the difference in means divided by the standard error. The standard error for a t-test is the pooled standard deviation times the square root of the combined variance, divided by the sample size. Or wait, since the variances might be different, she should use a Welch's t-test instead of a pooled t-test because the standard deviations are different (3.2 vs. 3.5).\n\nSo, to calculate the test statistic, T, it's (\u03bc_new - \u03bc_standard) divided by the standard error, which is sqrt[(s1\u00b2/n1 + s2\u00b2/n2) * (1/n1 + 1/n2)]. Alternatively, since she has 15 in each, n1 and n2 are both 15. So, the denominator becomes sqrt[(3.2\u00b2/15 + 3.5\u00b2/15) * (1/15 + 1/15)].\n\nLet me compute that. First, calculate each variance contribution: (3.2\u00b2)/15 \u2248 10.24/15 \u2248 0.6827, and (3.5\u00b2)/15 \u2248 12.25/15 \u2248 0.8167. Adding those gives 1.4994. Then multiply by (1/15 + 1/15) = 2/15 \u2248 0.1333. So, 1.4994 * 0.1333 \u2248 0.1999. The square root of that is sqrt(0.1999) \u2248 0.4472.\n\nSo, the standard error is approximately 0.4472. Now, the mean difference is 28.5 - 25.7 = 2.8 cm. So, T = 2.8 / 0.4472 \u2248 6.27.\n\nNow, for the degrees of freedom. Since the variances are different, we use Welch's approximation. The formula is df = (s1\u00b2/n1 + s2\u00b2/n2)\u00b2 / ( (s1\u00b2/n1)\u00b2/(n1-1) + (s2\u00b2/n2)\u00b2/(n2-1) ). Plugging in the numbers: numerator is (0.6827 + 0.8167)\u00b2 = (1.4994)\u00b2 \u2248 2.2473. The denominator is (0.6827\u00b2)/(14) + (0.8167\u00b2)/(14) \u2248 (0.4659 + 0.5398)/14 \u2248 1.0057/14 \u2248 0.0721. So, df \u2248 2.2473 / 0.0721 \u2248 31.15. We round that to 31 degrees of freedom.\n\nNow, with a significance level of 0.05, the critical t-value for one-tailed test at 31 degrees of freedom is approximately 1.699. Since our calculated t-value is 6.27, which is way higher than 1.699, we reject the null hypothesis. That means there's a statistically significant difference in mean height between the two fertilizers, supporting the alternative hypothesis that the new fertilizer increases growth.\n\nWait, let me double-check the calculations. The standard error calculation: yes, using Welch's because unequal variances. The test statistic seems correct. Degrees of freedom came out to about 31, which is reasonable. The t-value is indeed much larger than the critical value, so we definitely reject H0.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the researcher would reject the null hypothesis at the 0.05 level because the observed difference in means is statistically significant.\n</think>\n\nThe researcher sets up a hypothesis test to compare the mean height of tomato plants treated with new versus standard fertilizer. The null hypothesis (H\u2080) states that there's no difference in mean height between the two treatments, while the alternative hypothesis (H\u2081) states that the new fertilizer increases growth. \n\nUsing Welch's t-test due to unequal variances, the calculated t-value of approximately 6.27 is significantly higher than the critical value of 1.699 for a one-tailed test at \u03b1 = 0.05, leading to the rejection of the null hypothesis.\n\n**Hypotheses:**\n- Null hypothesis (H\u2080): \u03bc_new = \u03bc_standard\n- Alternative hypothesis (H\u2081): \u03bc_new > \u03bc_standard\n\n**Decision:** Reject H\u2080.\n\n**Conclusion:** There is a statistically significant difference in mean height between the new and standard fertilizers, suggesting the new fertilizer increases growth.\n\nDONE."

Then, based on the data provided, would you reject the null hypothesis at a significance level of 0.05? Explain your reasoning step by step. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I need to help the researcher figure out if the new fertilizer is actually increasing tomato plant growth compared to the standard fertilizer. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that in hypothesis testing, we start by setting up our null and alternative hypotheses. The null hypothesis, H\u2080, usually states that there's no effect, meaning the new fertilizer doesn't make a difference. The alternative hypothesis, H\u2081, is what we're trying to prove, which in this case is that the new fertilizer does increase growth.\n\nSo, mathematically, that would translate to:\n- H\u2080: The mean height of the new fertilizer plants is equal to the mean height of the standard fertilizer plants.\n- H\u2081: The mean height of the new fertilizer plants is greater than the mean height of the standard fertilizer plants.\n\nThat makes sense because the researcher is testing if the new fertilizer is better, not worse or the same.\n\nNext, I need to decide what statistical test to use. Since the researcher is comparing two groups and measures the height of each plant, a t-test for independent means seems appropriate. This test compares the means of two samples from two different populations (or groups), which fits the scenario here.\n\nNow, onto calculating the necessary values. We have the means and standard deviations for both groups. Let me jot those down:\n\n- New Fertilizer (H\u2081): Mean = 28.5 cm, Standard Deviation (s) = 3.2 cm\n- Standard Fertilizer (H\u2080): Mean = 25.7 cm, Standard Deviation = 3.5 cm\n\nSince the sample sizes for both groups are equal (15 plants each), I can use the independent t-test formula:\n\nt = (Mean\u2081 - Mean\u2082) / sqrt[(s\u2081\u00b2 + s\u2082\u00b2)/N]\n\nWhere:\n- Mean\u2081 and Mean\u2082 are the sample means\n- s\u2081 and s\u2082 are the sample standard deviations\n- N is the total number of samples (30)\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nMean\u2081 = 28.5\nMean\u2082 = 25.7\ns\u2081 = 3.2\ns\u2082 = 3.5\nN = 30\n\nFirst, calculate the difference in means:\n28.5 - 25.7 = 2.8 cm\n\nNext, compute the variances:\ns\u2081\u00b2 = 3.2\u00b2 = 10.24\ns\u2082\u00b2 = 3.5\u00b2 = 12.25\n\nSum of variances = 10.24 + 12.25 = 22.49\nVariance = 22.49 / 30 \u2248 0.7497\n\nThen, take the square root of the variance to get the standard error:\nsqrt(0.7497) \u2248 0.866\n\nNow, calculate the t-statistic:\nt = 2.8 / 0.866 \u2248 3.24\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nDifference in means: 28.5 - 25.7 is indeed 2.8.\n\ns\u2081 squared is 10.24, s\u2082 squared is 12.25. Adding them gives 22.49. Divided by 30 gives approximately 0.7497. The square root of that is about 0.866. So, 2.8 divided by 0.866 is roughly 3.24. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nNow, I need to find the critical t-value from the t-distribution table. Since the significance level is 0.05 and there are two tails (because we're testing if the means are NOT equal), we use a two-tailed test. The degrees of freedom (df) is N - 2 = 30 - 2 = 28.\n\nLooking up the t-value for df=28 and \u03b1=0.05 (two-tailed). From the table, I find that the critical t-value is approximately \u00b12.04.\n\nOur calculated t-statistic is 3.24, which is greater than 2.04. Since our t-statistic falls into the rejection region (it's higher than the upper critical value), we reject the null hypothesis.\n\nTherefore, we have sufficient evidence at the 0.05 significance level to conclude that the new fertilizer increases tomato plant growth compared to the standard fertilizer.\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the standard error. The formula is sqrt[(s\u2081\u00b2 + s\u2082\u00b2)/N], right? So 10.24 + 12.25 is 22.49, divided by 30 is about 0.7497, square root is approximately 0.866. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nAlso, the sample sizes are equal, so using the independent t-test is correct. If they weren't equal, we might have to use a different test like the Mann-Whitney U, but in this case, it's okay.\n\nAnother thing to check is whether the difference in means is in the right direction. Since the new fertilizer group has a higher mean, our alternative hypothesis is that the new fertilizer is greater, which is correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, we set up the hypotheses, calculated the t-statistic, compared it to the critical value, and decided to reject H\u2080.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the new fertilizer increases tomato plant growth compared to the standard fertilizer, we set up the following hypotheses:\n\n- **Null Hypothesis (H\u2080):** The mean height of the new fertilizer plants is equal to the mean height of the standard fertilizer plants.\n  \n  Mathematically: \\( H_0: \\mu_{\\text{new}} = \\mu_{\\text{standard}} \\)\n\n- **Alternative Hypothesis (H\u2081):** The mean height of the new fertilizer plants is greater than the mean height of the standard fertilizer plants.\n\n  Mathematically: \\( H_1: \\mu_{\\text{new}} > \\mu_{\\text{standard}} \\)\n\nSince the sample sizes are equal (15 each), we perform an independent t-test. The t-statistic is calculated as:\n\n\\[\nt = \\frac{\\text{Mean}_{\\text{new}} - \\text{Mean}_{\\text{standard}}}{\\sqrt{\\frac{s_{\\text{new}}^2 + s_{\\text{standard}}^2}{N}}}\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n- Mean difference: \\( 28.5 - 25.7 = 2.8 \\) cm\n- Variances: \\( 10.24 + 12.25 = 22.49 \\)\n- Standard error: \\( \\sqrt{\\frac{22.49}{30}} \\approx 0.866 \\)\n- Degrees of freedom: \\( 30 - 2 = 28 \\)\n- Critical t-value (two-tailed, \u03b1=0.05): \u00b12.04\n\nCalculating the t-statistic:\n\n\\[\nt = \\frac{2.8}{0.866} \\approx 3.24\n\\]\n\nSince 3.24 > 2.04, we reject the null hypothesis. Therefore, at a 0.05 significance level, we conclude that the new fertilizer increases tomato plant growth.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe researcher should reject the null hypothesis. The new fertilizer significantly increases tomato plant growth compared to the standard fertilizer. DONE."
