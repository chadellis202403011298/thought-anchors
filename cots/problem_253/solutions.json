They've determined that the arrival of customers follows a Poisson process with an average rate of 6 customers per hour. The owner wants to understand the probabilities to help with staffing decisions.\n\n1. What is the probability of exactly 4 customers arriving during a randomly chosen hour?\n2. What is the probability of 8 or more customers arriving during a randomly chosen hour?\n3. If the bakery is open for 2 hours, what is the probability of exactly 10 customers arriving in total during this period? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I've got this problem about a Poisson process at a bakery. Let me try to wrap my head around it step by step. I remember that a Poisson process is a way to model the number of events happening in a fixed interval of time, like customer arrivals in this case. The average rate here is 6 customers per hour. \n\nFirst, let's go through each part of the problem one by one.\n\n**1. Probability of exactly 4 customers arriving in an hour.**\n\nOkay, so for a Poisson process, the probability mass function gives the probability of exactly k events occurring in a given time period. The formula for that is:\n\nP(k) = (\u03bb^k * e^(-\u03bb)) / k!\n\nWhere \u03bb is the average rate (the mean number of occurrences). In this case, \u03bb is 6.\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers, we get:\n\nP(4) = (6^4 * e^(-6)) / 4!\n\nLet me calculate that. First, 6^4 is 6*6*6*6. Let me compute that:\n\n6*6 = 36\n36*6 = 216\n216*6 = 1296\n\nSo, 6^4 is 1296.\n\nNext, e^(-6) is approximately... hmm, I don't remember the exact value, but I know e^(-6) is about 0.002478752.\n\nThen, 4! is 4*3*2*1 = 24.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nP(4) = (1296 * 0.002478752) / 24\n\nFirst, multiply 1296 by 0.002478752. Let me compute that:\n\n1296 * 0.002478752 \u2248 3.218\n\nThen divide by 24:\n\n3.218 / 24 \u2248 0.134125\n\nSo, the probability is approximately 13.41%.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Sometimes when I compute e^(-\u03bb), I might have used an incorrect value. Let me double-check e^(-6). \n\nUsing a calculator, e^(-6) is approximately 0.002478752. So that part is correct.\n\n1296 * 0.002478752 is indeed around 3.218, and 3.218 divided by 24 is about 0.134125. So yes, 13.41% seems right.\n\n**2. Probability of 8 or more customers arriving in an hour.**\n\nHmm, so this is the probability that 8, 9, 10, ..., up to \u03bb customers arrive in an hour. Since \u03bb is 6, we only need to sum up from 8 to 6, but wait, 8 is higher than 6, so actually, the probability of 8 or more is zero because the Poisson process can't have more than \u03bb customers in an hour? Wait, that doesn't make sense because Poisson can have any number, but the average is \u03bb.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. The Poisson distribution allows for any non-negative integer, regardless of \u03bb. So even though the average is 6, the probability of more than 6 is non-zero, but it gets smaller as we go higher.\n\nBut wait, in this case, \u03bb is 6, so the maximum probability is at k=6, and it decreases on either side. So for k=8, which is higher than \u03bb=6, the probability is non-zero but very small.\n\nSo, to find P(8 or more), which is P(8) + P(9) + ... But since \u03bb=6, and the process can't have more than \u03bb customers? Wait, no, that's not right. The Poisson distribution allows for any k \u2265 0, but the mean is \u03bb. So, the probability of k=8 is possible but very low.\n\nWait, but in reality, for a Poisson process, the number of events in a given interval can be any non-negative integer, regardless of the average rate. So, even though the average is 6, the probability of 8 or more is non-zero.\n\nSo, to find P(8 or more), we can compute the sum from k=8 to infinity of P(k). But since the mean is 6, the probabilities beyond k=6 will be very small, so maybe we can approximate it or compute it using the formula for the survival function of the Poisson distribution.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute each term from k=8 onwards and sum them up.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nFirst, compute P(8):\n\nP(8) = (6^8 * e^(-6)) / 8!\n\nCompute 6^8. Let's see:\n\n6^2 = 36\n6^3 = 216\n6^4 = 1296\n6^5 = 7776\n6^6 = 46656\n6^7 = 279936\n6^8 = 1679616\n\nSo, 6^8 is 1,679,616.\n\nNow, 8! is 40320.\n\nSo, P(8) = (1,679,616 * e^(-6)) / 40320\n\nWe know e^(-6) \u2248 0.002478752.\n\nSo, 1,679,616 * 0.002478752 \u2248 Let's compute that:\n\n1,679,616 * 0.002478752 \u2248 4,165.6\n\nThen, divide by 40320:\n\n4,165.6 / 40320 \u2248 0.103125\n\nSo, P(8) \u2248 0.103125 or 10.31%.\n\nNow, P(9):\n\nSimilarly, 6^9 = 6*1,679,616 = 10,077,696\n\n9! = 362880\n\nSo, P(9) = (10,077,696 * e^(-6)) / 362880\n\nAgain, e^(-6) \u2248 0.002478752\n\nSo, 10,077,696 * 0.002478752 \u2248 Let's compute:\n\n10,077,696 * 0.002478752 \u2248 25,000 (approximate)\n\nWait, let me do it more accurately.\n\n10,077,696 * 0.002478752\n\nFirst, 10,077,696 * 0.002 = 20,155.392\n\nThen, 10,077,696 * 0.000478752 \u2248 let's compute 10,077,696 * 0.0004 = 4,031.0784\n\nAnd 10,077,696 * 0.000078752 \u2248 approximately 10,077,696 * 0.00008 \u2248 806.2208\n\nSo, adding up: 4,031.0784 + 806.2208 \u2248 4,837.3\n\nSo total is approximately 20,155.392 + 4,837.3 \u2248 24,992.7\n\nNow, divide by 362,880:\n\n24,992.7 / 362,880 \u2248 0.0689 or 6.89%\n\nSo, P(9) \u2248 0.0689\n\nSimilarly, P(10):\n\n6^10 = 6*10,077,696 = 60,466,176\n\n10! = 3,628,800\n\nP(10) = (60,466,176 * e^(-6)) / 3,628,800\n\nAgain, e^(-6) \u2248 0.002478752\n\nSo, 60,466,176 * 0.002478752 \u2248 Let's compute:\n\n60,466,176 * 0.002 = 120,932.352\n\n60,466,176 * 0.000478752 \u2248 Let's compute 60,466,176 * 0.0004 = 24,186.4704\n\n60,466,176 * 0.000078752 \u2248 approx 60,466,176 * 0.00008 \u2248 4,837.293\n\nSo total \u2248 24,186.4704 + 4,837.293 \u2248 29,023.763\n\nTotal \u2248 120,932.352 + 29,023.763 \u2248 149,956.115\n\nNow, divide by 3,628,800:\n\n149,956.115 / 3,628,800 \u2248 0.0412 or 4.12%\n\nSo, P(10) \u2248 0.0412\n\nSimilarly, P(11):\n\n6^11 = 6*60,466,176 = 362,797,056\n\n11!

They've determined that the arrival of customers follows a Poisson process with an average rate of 6 customers per hour. The owner wants to understand the probabilities to help with staffing decisions.\n\n1. What is the probability of exactly 4 customers arriving during a randomly chosen hour?\n2. What is the probability of 8 or more customers arriving during a randomly chosen hour?\n3. If the bakery is open for 2 hours, what is the probability of exactly 10 customers arriving in total during this period? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I've got this problem about a Poisson process at a bakery. Let me try to figure it out step by step. \n\nFirst, the problem states that customers arrive at a Poisson rate of 6 per hour. That means the average number of customers arriving in any given hour is 6. Poisson processes are known for their characteristics of having a constant average rate and independent increments over time. \n\nThere are three questions to solve here. Let's tackle them one by one.\n\n**1. Probability of exactly 4 customers arriving in an hour.**\n\nOkay, so for Poisson distributions, the probability mass function is given by:\n\n\\[ P(k) = \\frac{e^{-\\lambda} \\cdot \\lambda^k}{k!} \\]\n\nWhere \\( \\lambda \\) is the average rate, which is 6 in this case, and \\( k \\) is the number of occurrences, which is 4 here.\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n\\[ P(4) = \\frac{e^{-6} \\cdot 6^4}{4!} \\]\n\nI need to compute this. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, calculate \\( 6^4 \\). That's 6*6=36, 36*6=216, 216*6=1296. So, 1296.\n\nNext, compute \\( 4! \\). That's 4*3*2*1=24.\n\nThen, \\( e^{-6} \\). Hmm, I remember that \\( e^{-1} \\) is about 0.3679, so \\( e^{-6} \\) would be \\( (e^{-1})^6 \\). Let's compute that:\n\n0.3679^2 = 0.1353\n\n0.1353^2 = 0.0183\n\n0.0183^2 = 0.000335\n\nWait, that's \\( e^{-6} \\approx 0.002478752 \\). I think that's the value.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n\\[ P(4) = \\frac{0.002478752 \\cdot 1296}{24} \\]\n\nLet me compute the numerator first: 0.002478752 * 1296.\n\n0.002478752 * 1000 = 2.478752\n\n0.002478752 * 200 = 0.4957504\n\n0.002478752 * 96 = let's see, 0.002478752 * 100 = 0.2478752, so subtract 0.002478752 * 4 = 0.009915008. So, 0.2478752 - 0.009915008 = 0.237960192\n\nAdding up: 2.478752 + 0.4957504 = 2.9745024 + 0.237960192 \u2248 3.212462592\n\nSo numerator is approximately 3.212462592.\n\nNow, divide by 24:\n\n3.212462592 / 24 \u2248 0.1342\n\nSo approximately 0.1342, or 13.42%.\n\nWait, let me double-check the calculation for \\( e^{-6} \\). Maybe I should use a calculator for more precision. Alternatively, I recall that \\( e^{-6} \\) is approximately 0.002478752.\n\nYes, that seems right. So the calculation should be accurate.\n\nSo, P(4) \u2248 0.1342 or 13.42%.\n\n**2. Probability of 8 or more customers arriving in an hour.**\n\nAlright, so for this, we need the cumulative probability from 8 to infinity. Since Poisson probabilities for k >= 8 can be found using the complement of the sum up to k=7.\n\nSo, P(k >= 8) = 1 - P(k <=7)\n\nWe can compute P(k=0) + P(k=1) + ... + P(k=7).\n\nAlternatively, use the cumulative distribution function (CDF) for Poisson.\n\nBut calculating each term might be tedious, but let's try.\n\nFirst, we need to compute P(0) through P(7).\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFor each k from 0 to 7:\n\n\\[ P(k) = \\frac{e^{-6} \\cdot 6^k}{k!} \\]\n\nLet me compute each term step by step.\n\n- P(0): \\( \\frac{e^{-6} \\cdot 6^0}{0!} = e^{-6} \\approx 0.002478752 \\)\n- P(1): \\( \\frac{e^{-6} \\cdot 6^1}{1!} = 6e^{-6} \\approx 0.0148725 \\)\n- P(2): \\( \\frac{e^{-6} \\cdot 6^2}{2!} = \\frac{36e^{-6}}{2} = 18e^{-6} \\approx 0.044911 \\)\n- P(3): \\( \\frac{e^{-6} \\cdot 6^3}{6} = \\frac{216e^{-6}}{6} = 36e^{-6} \\approx 0.08879 \\)\n- P(4): As before, \u22480.1342\n- P(5): \\( \\frac{e^{-6} \\cdot 6^5}{120} = \\frac{7776e^{-6}}{120} = 64.8e^{-6} \u2248 0.1602 \\)\nWait, let me compute that correctly.\n\nWait, 6^5 is 7776. 7776 / 120 = 64.8. So, 64.8 * e^{-6} \u2248 64.8 * 0.002478752 \u2248 let's compute 64.8 * 0.002478752.\n\n64 * 0.002478752 = 0.15947\n\n0.8 * 0.002478752 \u2248 0.001982\n\nTotal \u2248 0.16145\n\nSo, P(5) \u2248 0.16145\n\n- P(6): \\( \\frac{e^{-6} \\cdot 6^6}{720} = \\frac{46656e^{-6}}{720} = 64.8e^{-6} same as P(5) multiplied by 6/5? Wait, no.\n\nWait, 6^6 is 46656. 46656 / 720 = let's divide 46656 by 720.\n\n720 * 64 = 46080\n\n46656 - 46080 = 576\n\n576 / 720 = 0.8\n\nSo total is 64.8, same as P(5). So, P(6) = 64.8 * e^{-6} \u2248 same as P(5), which was \u22480.16145\n\nWait, that can't be. Wait, no, P(k) is for k=6, so it's 64.8 * e^{-6} \u2248 same as P(5). Wait, but that seems odd because the Poisson distribution is decreasing after a point. Wait, actually, let me check.\n\nWait, 6^6 / 720 = 46656 / 720. Let's compute that:\n\n46656 \u00f7 720:\n\n720 * 60 = 43200\n\n46656 - 43200 = 3456\n\n720 * 4 = 2880\n\n3456 - 2880 = 576\n\n720 * 0.8 = 576\n\nSo total is 60 + 4 + 0.8 = 64.8\n\nYes, same as P(5). So P(6) = 64.8 * e^{-6} \u2248 same as P(5), which is \u22480.16145\n\nWait, but that can't be because the Poisson distribution peaks around \u03bb. Since \u03bb=6, the peak is at k=6. So P(6) should be the highest.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, 6^6 is 46656. Divided by 720 is indeed 64.8. So P(6)=64.8 * e^{-6} \u2248 same as P(5). Hmm, that's correct because the formula is symmetric in a way.\n\nWait, but actually, let me compute P(6):\n\nP(6)= (6^6 e^{-6}) / 6! = (46656 e^{-6}) / 720 = 64.8 e^{-6} \u2248 same as P(5). So yes, it's correct.\n\nSo, P(6) \u22480.16145\n\n- P(7): \\( \\frac{e^{-6} \\cdot 6^7}{5040} = \\frac{279936e^{-6}}{5040} \\)\n\nCompute 279936 / 5040.\n\n5040 * 55 = 277,200\n\n279,936 - 277,200 = 2,736\n\n5040 * 0.5 = 2520\n\n2,736 - 2520 = 216\n\n5040 * 0.04 = 201.6\n\n216 - 201.6 = 14.4\n\nSo total is 55 + 0.5 + 0.04 + (14.4 /5040). Wait, this is getting too small.\n\nAlternatively, compute 279936 /5040.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 1008: 279936 /1008=277.2, 5040/1008=5.\n\nSo 277.2 /5=55.44\n\nSo, 55.44 * e^{-6} \u224855.44 *0.002478752\u2248 let's compute:\n\n55 *0.002478752=0.1362\n\n0.44 *0.002478752\u22480.00109\n\nTotal\u22480.1373\n\nSo P(7)\u22480.1373\n\nNow, sum up P(0) through P(7):\n\nP(0)=0.002478752\n\nP(1)=0.0148725\n\nP(2)=0.044911\n\nP(3)=0.08879\n\nP(4)=0.1342\n\nP(5)=0.16145\n\nP(6)=0.16145\n\nP(7)=0.1373\n\nLet's add them up step by step.\n\nStart with P(0)=0.002478752\n\nAdd P(1)=0.0148725 \u2192 total\u22480.01735125\n\nAdd P(2)=0.044911 \u2192 total\u22480.06226225\n\nAdd P(3)=0.08879 \u2192 total\u22480.15105225\n\nAdd P(4)=0.1342 \u2192 total\u22480.28525225\n\nAdd P(5)=0.16145 \u2192 total\u22480.44670225\n\nAdd P(6)=0.16145 \u2192 total\u22480.60815225\n\nAdd P(7)=0.1373 \u2192 total\u22480.74545225\n\nSo, P(k <=7)=0.74545225\n\nTherefore, P(k >=8)=1 - 0.74545225=0.25454775 or 25.45%\n\nSo approximately 25.45% chance of 8 or more customers arriving in an hour.\n\n**3. Probability of exactly 10 customers in 2 hours.**\n\nThis is a bit trickier. Since the process is Poisson, the number of customers in 2 hours is the sum of two independent Poisson variables, each with \u03bb=6. The sum follows a Poisson distribution with \u03bb=12.\n\nWait, is that correct? Wait, no. The sum of two independent Poisson variables is Poisson with \u03bb1 + \u03bb2, so yes, \u03bb=12.\n\nBut the question is about exactly 10 customers in total. So, we need P(k=10) for a Poisson(12) distribution.\n\nSo, using the same formula:\n\n\\[ P(k) = \\frac{e^{-12} \\cdot 12^{10}}{10!} \\]\n\nBut wait, let me confirm. The number of customers in 2 hours is Poisson(\u03bb=12). So, yes, P(k=10)= [e^{-12} *12^{10}]/10!\n\nSo, let's compute this.\n\nFirst, compute 12^{10}.\n\n12^2=144\n\n12^3=1728\n\n12^4=20736\n\n12^5=248832\n\n12^6=2,985,984\n\n12^7=35,831,808\n\n12^8=429,981,696\n\n12^9=5,159,780,352\n\n12^{10}=61,917,364,224\n\nSo, 12^10=61,917,364,224\n\n10!=3,628,800\n\nSo, numerator: e^{-12} *61,917,364,224\n\nCompute e^{-12}.

    "solution": "Solve this problem step by step. End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: A small bakery tracks the number of customers who enter per hour. They've determined that the arrival of customers follows a Poisson process with an average rate of 6 customers per hour. The owner wants to understand the probabilities to help with staffing decisions.\n\n1. What is the probability of exactly 4 customers arriving during a randomly chosen hour?\n2. What is the probability of 8 or more customers arriving during a randomly chosen hour?\n3. If the bakery is open for 2 hours, what is the probability of exactly 10 customers arriving in total during this period? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I need to solve these three probability questions related to a Poisson process. Let me start by recalling what a Poisson process is. From what I remember, a Poisson process is a counting process that counts the number of events happening in a fixed interval of time. The key characteristics are that the number of events in non-overlapping intervals are independent, and the number of events in any interval follows a Poisson distribution. Also, the Poisson process has a constant average rate and independent increments.\n\nThe given problem states that the average rate (lambda) is 6 customers per hour. So, for each hour, the expected number of customers is 6.\n\n**Problem 1: Probability of exactly 4 customers arriving during a randomly chosen hour.**\n\nAlright, for the first question, we're looking for the probability of exactly 4 customers arriving in one hour. Since the process is Poisson, the probability mass function (PMF) should be applicable here. The PMF for a Poisson distribution is given by:\n\nP(k) = (\u03bb^k * e^(-\u03bb)) / k!\n\nWhere:\n- P(k) is the probability of k events occurring.\n- \u03bb is the average rate (in this case, 6).\n- k is the number of occurrences (here, 4).\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers:\n\nP(4) = (6^4 * e^(-6)) / 4!\n\nFirst, I need to compute 6^4. Let's see:\n\n6^1 = 6  \n6^2 = 36  \n6^3 = 216  \n6^4 = 1296\n\nNext, 4! is 4 factorial, which is 4*3*2*1 = 24.\n\nSo now, P(4) = (1296 * e^(-6)) / 24\n\nI can compute e^(-6) using a calculator. I remember that e is approximately 2.71828, so e^6 is about 403.4288. Therefore, e^(-6) is 1 / 403.4288 \u2248 0.002478752.\n\nNow, let's compute the numerator: 1296 * 0.002478752 \u2248 1296 * 0.002478752 \u2248 3.215.\n\nThen, divide that by 24: 3.215 / 24 \u2248 0.1339.\n\nSo, approximately 0.1339 or 13.39% chance.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any errors.\n\nFirst, 6^4 is definitely 1296. Correct.\n\n4! is 24, that's right.\n\ne^6 is approximately 403.4288, so e^(-6) is about 0.002478752. Correct.\n\n1296 * 0.002478752: Let me compute 1296 * 0.002 = 2.592, and 1296 * 0.000478752. Wait, maybe it's easier to do 1296 * 0.002478752 directly.\n\nAlternatively, 1296 * 0.002478752 \u2248 1296 * 0.0024 = 3.1104, and then 1296 * 0.000078752 \u2248 approximately 0.102. So total \u2248 3.1104 + 0.102 \u2248 3.2124.\n\nDivided by 24: 3.2124 / 24 \u2248 0.1338, which is approximately 0.1338 or 0.134. So, 13.4%.\n\nI think that's correct. So, for Problem 1, the probability is approximately 0.134.\n\n**Problem 2: Probability of 8 or more customers arriving during a randomly chosen hour.**\n\nAlright, for the second question, we need the probability that 8 or more customers arrive in an hour. Since the Poisson PMF gives the probability for each k, we can sum the probabilities from k=8 to k=\u221e.\n\nBut in practice, since lambda is 6, the probabilities become very small beyond a certain point, so we can compute the sum from k=8 to k=6, but wait, lambda is 6, so k can go up to 6 before the probabilities start to decrease. Wait, no, actually, in Poisson distribution, probabilities increase up to the floor of lambda and then decrease. So, for lambda=6, the probabilities increase up to k=6 and then decrease.\n\nWait, no, actually, the Poisson distribution has a peak around lambda, so for lambda=6, the probability increases up to k=6 and then decreases. So, the maximum probability is at k=6.\n\nWait, but in this case, we need the probability of 8 or more. Since 8 is higher than 6, the probabilities from k=8 onwards will be very small.\n\nBut let me think. Since the Poisson PMF is P(k) = (\u03bb^k e^(-\u03bb))/k!, so for k=8, it's (6^8 e^(-6))/8!.\n\nBut calculating this manually would be tedious, but perhaps I can compute it step by step.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the Poisson distribution, which is P(X \u2264 k) = sum from i=0 to k of P(i). So, P(X \u22658) = 1 - P(X \u22647). So, if I compute P(X \u22647), subtract it from 1, I get P(X \u22658).\n\nLet me compute P(X \u22647). That is sum from k=0 to 7 of (6^k e^(-6))/k!.\n\nBut calculating this manually would take time.

    "solution": "Solve this problem step by step. End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: A small bakery tracks the number of customers who enter per hour. They've determined that the arrival of customers follows a Poisson process with an average rate of 6 customers per hour. The owner wants to understand the probabilities to help with staffing decisions.\n\n1. What is the probability of exactly 4 customers arriving during a randomly chosen hour?\n2. What is the probability of 8 or more customers arriving during a randomly chosen hour?\n3. If the bakery is open for 2 hours, what is the probability of exactly 10 customers arriving in total during this period? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I've got this problem about a bakery tracking customer arrivals using a Poisson process. Let me try to break it down step by step. I remember that a Poisson process has a constant average rate and independent arrivals, which are key here.\n\nFirst, the problem has three parts. I'll take them one by one.\n\n1. **Probability of exactly 4 customers arriving in an hour:**\n\nI recall that the Poisson probability mass function is given by the formula:\n\n\\[ P(k) = \\frac{e^{-\\lambda} \\lambda^k}{k!} \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( \\lambda \\) is the average rate (expected value), which is 6 customers per hour here.\n- \\( k \\) is the number of occurrences, which in this case is 4.\n\nSo plugging in the values:\n\n\\[ P(4) = \\frac{e^{-6} \\times 6^4}{4!} \\]\n\nLet me compute each part step by step.\n\nFirst, compute \\( e^{-6} \\). I know that \\( e^6 \\) is approximately 403.4288, so \\( e^{-6} \\) is about 1 divided by 403.4288, which is roughly 0.002478752.\n\nNext, compute \\( 6^4 \\). That's 6*6*6*6 = 1296.\n\nThen, compute \\( 4! \\). That's 4*3*2*1 = 24.\n\nNow, multiply \\( e^{-6} \\times 6^4 \\): 0.002478752 * 1296 \u2248 3.2231.\n\nThen divide by 24: 3.2231 / 24 \u2248 0.134287.\n\nSo, the probability is approximately 0.1343 or 13.43%.\n\n2. **Probability of 8 or more customers arriving in an hour:**\n\nHmm, this is asking for the cumulative probability from 8 to infinity. Since calculating each term from 8 upwards would be tedious, I remember that the Poisson CDF (cumulative distribution function) can be used here. The CDF is:\n\n\\[ P(X \\geq k) = 1 - P(X < k) \\]\n\nBut more accurately, it's:\n\n\\[ P(X \\geq k) = \\sum_{n=k}^{\\infty} \\frac{e^{-\\lambda} \\lambda^n}{n!} \\]\n\nBut calculating this sum manually would be time-consuming. Alternatively, I can use the complement of the CDF up to 7.\n\nSo, \\( P(X \\geq 8) = 1 - P(X \\leq 7) \\).\n\nI'll compute \\( P(X \\leq 7) \\) using the Poisson CDF. Alternatively, I can sum the probabilities from 0 to 7 and subtract from 1.\n\nLet me compute each term from 0 to 7 and sum them up.\n\nCompute each \\( P(k) \\) for k=0 to 7:\n\n- \\( P(0) = \\frac{e^{-6} \\times 6^0}{0!} = e^{-6} \u2248 0.002478752 \\)\n- \\( P(1) = \\frac{e^{-6} \\times 6^1}{1!} = 6e^{-6} \u2248 0.01487456 \\)\n- \\( P(2) = \\frac{e^{-6} \\times 6^2}{2!} = \\frac{36e^{-6}}{2} = 18e^{-6} \u2248 0.044738 \\)\n- \\( P(3) = \\frac{e^{-6} \\times 6^3}{6} = \\frac{216e^{-6}}{6} = 36e^{-6} \u2248 0.089443 \\)\n- \\( P(4) = \\frac{e^{-6} \\times 6^4}{24} = \\frac{1296e^{-6}}{24} \u2248 0.134287 \\) (from part 1)\n- \\( P(5) = \\frac{e^{-6} \\times 6^5}{120} = \\frac{7776e^{-6}}{120} \u2248 64.8e^{-6} \u2248 0.01605 \\)\n- \\( P(6) = \\frac{e^{-6} \\times 6^6}{720} = \\frac{46656e^{-6}}{720} \u2248 64.8e^{-6} \u2248 0.01605 \\)\n- \\( P(7) = \\frac{e^{-6} \\times 6^7}{5040} = \\frac{279936e^{-6}}{5040} \u2248 55.32e^{-6} \u2248 0.0001366 \\)\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check \\( P(5) \\) and \\( P(6) \\).\n\nFor \\( P(5) \\):\n\n\\( 6^5 = 7776 \\), and 7776 / 120 = 64.8. So \\( P(5) = 64.8e^{-6} \u2248 64.8 * 0.002478752 \u2248 0.1613 \\). Wait, that contradicts my earlier calculation. Let me check.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier.

Let me check if I added correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating \\( P(5) \\) and \\( P(6) \\). Let me recalculate those.\n\nFor \\( P(5) \\):\n\n\\( \\lambda =6 \\), k=5.\n\n\\( P(5) = e^{-6} * 6^5 / 5! = e^{-6} * 7776 / 120 \\)\n\n7776 / 120 = 64.8\n\nSo, \\( P(5) = 64.8 * e^{-6} \u2248 64.8 * 0.002478752 \u2248 0.1613 \\) (correct)\n\nSimilarly, \\( P(6) = e^{-6} * 6^6 / 6! = e^{-6} * 46656 / 720 = e^{-6} * 64.8 \u2248 0.1613 \\) (correct)\n\n\\( P(7) = e^{-6} * 6^7 / 5040 = e^{-6} * 279936 / 5040 \u2248 e^{-6} * 55.542857 \u2248 0.1375 \\) (correct)\n\nSo, the sum up to 7 is indeed approximately 0.7459, making \\( P(X \\geq 8) \u2248 0.2541 \\).\n\n3. **Probability of exactly 10 customers in 2 hours:**\n\nThis is a Poisson process over 2 hours. Since the process is memoryless, the number of customers in each hour is independent. So, the total number in 2 hours is the sum of two independent Poisson variables with parameter \\( \\lambda =6 \\).\n\nThe number of customers in two hours, say \\( X = X_1 + X_2 \\), where \\( X_1 \\) and \\( X_2 \\) are both Poisson(6).\n\nThe probability mass function for the sum of two independent Poisson variables is given by the convolution:\n\n\\[ P(X = k) = \\sum_{i=0}^{k} \\frac{e^{-6} 6^i}{i!} \\cdot \\frac{e^{-6} 6^{k-i}}{(k-i)!} = e^{-12} \\sum_{i=0}^{k} \\frac{6^k}{i! (k-i)!} \\]\n\nBut that's a bit complex. Alternatively, we can use the formula for the sum of two Poisson variables:\n\n\\[ P(X = k) = \\frac{e^{-12} 6^k}{k!} \\sum_{i=0}^{k} \\frac{k!}{i! (k-i)!} } \\]\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to compute it using the convolution formula.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to compute the probability by considering all possible ways to get 10 customers in two hours. That is, the number of customers in the first hour (k) and the second hour (10 - k), and sum over k from 0 to 10.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[ P(X = 10) = \\sum_{k=0}^{10} P(X_1 = k) \\cdot P(X_2 = 10 - k) \\]\n\nBut since \\( X_1 \\) and \\( X_2 \\) are independent, this becomes:\n\n\\[ P(X =10) = \\sum_{k=0}^{10} \\frac{e^{-6} 6^k}{k!} \\cdot \\frac{e^{-6} 6^{10 -k}}{(10 -k)!} = e^{-12} \\sum_{k=0}^{10} \\frac{6^{10}}{k! (10 -k)!} \\]\n\nBut 6^{10} / (k! (10 -k)!) is the binomial coefficient C(10, k) * 6^{10}, so:\n\n\\[ P(X=10) = e^{-12} \\sum_{k=0}^{10} \\frac{10!}{k! (10 -k)!} 6^{10} / 10! \\]\n\nWait, that's getting a bit tangled. Alternatively, the sum is the binomial probability mass function with parameters n=10 and p=6, but scaled by e^{-12}.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to compute the sum directly.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the generating function approach.\n\nThe generating function for a Poisson(6) is:\n\n\\( G(t) = e^{-6} (1 + t)^6 \\)\n\nThe generating function for the sum of two independent Poisson(6) variables is \\( [e^{-6} (1 + t)^6]^2 = e^{-12} (1 + t)^{12} \\)\n\nThe coefficient of \\( t^{10} \\) in \\( (1 + t)^{12} \\) is \\( \\binom{12}{10} = 66 \\).\n\nThus,\n\n\\[ P(X=10) = e^{-12} \\times 66 \\]\n\nCompute \\( e^{-12} \\):\n\n\\( e^{12} \u2248 162754.791 \\), so \\( e^{-12} \u2248 1 / 162754.791 \u2248 6.1323 \\times 10^{-6} \\)\n\nThus,\n\n\\( P(X=10) \u2248 6.1323 \\times 10^{-6} \\times 66 \u2248 4.049 \\times 10^{-4} \\) or approximately 0.0004049.\n\nAlternatively, let me double-check using the convolution formula.\n\nThe probability mass function for the sum of two independent Poisson variables is given by:\n\n\\[ P(X = k) = \\sum_{i=0}^{k} \\frac{e^{-12} 6^i}{i!} \\cdot \\frac{6^{k - i}}{(k - i)!} \\]\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n\\[ P(X = k) = e^{-12} \\sum_{i=0}^{k} \\frac{6^k}{i! (k - i)!} \\]\n\nBut this is the same as:\n\n\\[ P(X =k) = e^{-12} \\sum_{i=0}^{k} \\binom{k}{i} \\frac{6^k}{k!} \\]\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to use the generating function approach as before.\n\nYes, using generating functions, the result is \\( e^{-12} \\times \\binom{12}{10} = e^{-12} \\times 66 \u2248 6.1323e-6 * 66 \u2248 0.0004049 \\).\n\nSo, approximately 0.04049%.\n\nBut that seems quite low. Let me check if I did the generating function correctly.\n\nWait, the generating function for the sum of two Poisson variables is indeed the square of the individual generating function, so \\( G(t)^2 = e^{-12} (1 + t)^{12} \\). The coefficient of \\( t^{10} \\) is \\( \\binom{12}{10} = 66 \\), so yes, \\( P(X=10) = e^{-12} \\times 66 \u2248 6.1323e-6 * 66 \u2248 0.0004049 \\).\n\nSo, about 0.0405%.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake here. Because the Poisson process is over 2 hours, the rate is still 6 per hour, so the combined rate is 12 per hour, which is what I used. So, the total number in 2 hours is Poisson(12), but the pmf is \\( e^{-12} \\times \\frac{12^{10}}{10!} \\). Wait, no, that's not correct because the sum of two Poisson(6) variables isn't Poisson(12). Wait, actually, the sum of two independent Poisson variables is Poisson with parameter equal to the sum of their rates. So, if each has rate 6, the sum has rate 12, so the pmf is indeed \\( e^{-12} \\times \\frac{12^{10}}{10!} \\).\n\nWait, that contradicts my earlier approach. Let me clarify.\n\nThe sum of two independent Poisson variables with parameters \\( \\lambda_1 \\) and \\( \\lambda_2 \\) is Poisson with parameter \\( \\lambda = \\lambda_1 + \\lambda_2 \\). So, in this case, \\( \\lambda = 6 + 6 = 12 \\). Therefore, the pmf is:\n\n\\[ P(X = 10) = e^{-12} \\times \\frac{12^{10}}{10!} \\]\n\nLet me compute that.\n\nFirst, compute \\( 12^{10} \\).\n\n12^1=12\n\n12^2=144\n\n12^3=1728\n\n12^4=20736\n\n12^5=248832\n\n12^6=2985984\n\n12^7=35831808\n\n12^8=429981696\n\n12^9=5159780352\n\n12^10=61917364224\n\nNow, 10! = 3628800\n\nSo,\n\n\\( \\frac{12^{10}}{10!} = \\frac{61917364224}{3628800} \u2248 17073.8 \\)\n\nThen, \\( e^{-12} \u2248 6.1323e-6 \\)\n\nSo,\n\n\\( P(X=10) = 6.1323e-"

    "solution": "Solve this problem step by step. End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: A small bakery tracks the number of customers who enter per hour. They've determined that the arrival of customers follows a Poisson process with an average rate of 6 customers per hour. The owner wants to understand the probabilities to help with staffing decisions.\n\n1. What is the probability of exactly 4 customers arriving during a randomly chosen hour?\n2. What is the probability of 8 or more customers arriving during a randomly chosen hour?\n3. If the bakery is open for 2 hours, what is the probability of exactly 10 customers arriving in total during this period? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this problem about a Poisson process at a bakery. Let me try to work through each part step by step. I'm a bit rusty on Poisson processes, but I remember they're used for counting events happening at a constant average rate, which makes sense for customer arrivals.\n\n**Problem 1: Probability of exactly 4 customers arriving in an hour.**\n\nOkay, the Poisson probability formula is P(k) = (\u03bb^k * e^(-\u03bb)) / k!, where \u03bb is the average rate. Here, \u03bb is 6 customers per hour. So, for k=4, let's plug in the numbers.\n\nFirst, calculate \u03bb^k: 6^4. Hmm, 6*6=36, 36*6=216, 216*6=1296. So, 1296.\n\nNext, e^(-\u03bb) is e^(-6). I remember e is approximately 2.71828. So, e^(-6) is 1/(e^6). Let me compute e^6: e^2 is about 7.389, e^3 is around 20.085, e^4 is roughly 54.598, e^5 is about 148.413, and e^6 is approximately 403.4288. So, 1/403.4288 is about 0.002478752.\n\nThen, k! for k=4 is 4 factorial, which is 4*3*2*1=24.\n\nPutting it all together: (1296 * 0.002478752) / 24.\n\nFirst, multiply 1296 * 0.002478752. Let me compute that. 1296 * 0.002 is 2.592, 1296 * 0.000478752 is approximately 1296 * 0.0004 = 0.5184, and 1296 * 0.000078752 \u2248 0.102. So total is roughly 2.592 + 0.5184 + 0.102 \u2248 3.212.\n\nNow, divide by 24: 3.212 / 24 \u2248 0.1342, or about 13.42%.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high for exactly 4 customers. Let me double-check the calculations.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing e^(-6). Let me use a calculator function. e^6 is indeed about 403.4288, so 1/e^6 \u2248 0.002478752. So that part is correct.\n\n1296 * 0.002478752: Let me compute more accurately. 1296 * 0.002 = 2.592, 1296 * 0.0004 = 0.5184, 1296 * 0.000078752 \u2248 1296 * 0.00007 = 0.09072, and 1296 * 0.000008752 \u2248 0.0113. Adding these: 2.592 + 0.5184 = 3.1104, plus 0.09072 = 3.20112, plus 0.0113 \u2248 3.2124. So, yes, about 3.2124.\n\nDivide by 24: 3.2124 / 24 \u2248 0.1343, so approximately 13.43%.\n\nWait, but I thought Poisson probabilities peak around \u03bb, so at \u03bb=6, the peak is at k=6. So, k=4 should be a bit lower than the peak. Let me check the Poisson distribution table or use another method.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the formula correctly: (6^4 * e^(-6)) / 4! = (1296 * 0.002478752) / 24.\n\nLet me compute 1296 * 0.002478752 first. Let me do this more accurately:\n\n1296 * 0.002478752.\n\nFirst, 1296 * 0.002 = 2.592.\n\n1296 * 0.0004 = 0.5184.\n\n1296 * 0.00007 = 0.09072.\n\n1296 * 0.000008752 \u2248 1296 * 0.000008 = 0.010368, and 1296 * 0.000000752 \u2248 0.000976.\n\nAdding these up: 2.592 + 0.5184 = 3.1104, plus 0.09072 = 3.20112, plus 0.010368 = 3.211488, plus 0.000976 \u2248 3.212464.\n\nSo, 3.212464 divided by 24: 3.212464 / 24 \u2248 0.1343 or 13.43%.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the probability is approximately 13.43%.\n\n**Problem 2: Probability of 8 or more customers arriving in an hour.**\n\nThis is the complement of the probability of fewer than 8 customers, i.e., P(X < 8). So, P(X >=8) = 1 - P(X <=7).\n\nAlternatively, we can compute the sum from k=8 to infinity of (\u03bb^k e^(-\u03bb))/k!.\n\nBut calculating this directly might be time-consuming. However, for Poisson, there's a relationship with the cumulative distribution function, which can be computed using the formula:\n\nP(X <=k) = e^(-\u03bb) * sum_{i=0}^k (\u03bb^i)/i!\n\nSo, we can compute P(X <=7) and subtract from 1.\n\nLet me compute P(X <=7):\n\nCompute sum_{i=0}^7 (6^i)/i!.\n\nCompute each term:\n\ni=0: 6^0 / 0! = 1/1 = 1\n\ni=1: 6/1 = 6\n\ni=2: 36/2 = 18\n\ni=3: 216/6 = 36\n\ni=4: 1296/24 = 54\n\ni=5: 7776/120 = 64.8\n\ni=6: 46656/720 = 64.8\n\ni=7: 279936/5040 \u2248 55.5556\n\nNow, sum these up:\n\n1 + 6 = 7\n\n7 + 18 = 25\n\n25 + 36 = 61\n\n61 + 54 = 115\n\n115 + 64.8 = 179.8\n\n179.8 + 64.8 = 244.6\n\n244.6 + 55.5556 \u2248 300.1556\n\nSo, sum is approximately 300.1556.\n\nMultiply by e^(-6) \u2248 0.002478752.\n\nSo, P(X <=7) \u2248 300.1556 * 0.002478752.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n300 * 0.002478752 = 0.7436256\n\n0.1556 * 0.002478752 \u2248 0.0003857\n\nTotal \u2248 0.7436256 + 0.0003857 \u2248 0.7440113\n\nSo, P(X <=7) \u2248 0.7440113\n\nTherefore, P(X >=8) = 1 - 0.7440113 \u2248 0.2559887, or approximately 25.59%.\n\nWait, that seems a bit low. Let me check the sum again.\n\nWait, let me recalculate the sum of (6^i)/i! from i=0 to 7.\n\ni=0: 1\n\ni=1: 6\n\ni=2: 36/2=18\n\ni=3: 216/6=36\n\ni=4: 1296/24=54\n\ni=5: 7776/120=64.8\n\ni=6: 46656/720=64.8\n\ni=7: 279936/5040=55.5556\n\nNow, adding them:\n\n1 + 6 =7\n\n7+18=25\n\n25+36=61\n\n61+54=115\n\n115+64.8=179.8\n\n179.8+64.8=244.6\n\n244.6 +55.5556\u2248300.1556\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the sum is indeed approximately 300.1556.\n\nThen, 300.1556 * e^(-6) \u2248 300.1556 * 0.002478752 \u2248 ?\n\nLet me compute 300 * 0.002478752 = 0.7436256\n\n0.1556 * 0.002478752 \u2248 0.0003857\n\nTotal \u2248 0.7436256 + 0.0003857 \u2248 0.7440113\n\nSo, P(X <=7) \u2248 0.7440113\n\nThus, P(X >=8) = 1 - 0.7440113 \u2248 0.2559887, which is about 25.59%.\n\nThat seems reasonable because the Poisson distribution is right-skewed, so the probability of more than 7 is about 25.59%.\n\n**Problem 3: Probability of exactly 10 customers in 2 hours.**\n\nThis is a Poisson process, so the number of customers in 2 hours follows a Poisson distribution with \u03bb = 2*6 =12.\n\nWe need P(X=10), where X ~ Poisson(12).\n\nUsing the same formula: P(10) = (12^10 * e^(-12)) / 10!\n\nFirst, compute 12^10. That's a big number. Let me see:\n\n12^2=144\n\n12^3=1728\n\n12^4=20736\n\n12^5=248832\n\n12^6=2985984\n\n12^7=35831808\n\n12^8=429981696\n\n12^9=5159780352\n\n12^10=61917364224\n\nSo, 12^10 = 61,917,364,224.\n\ne^(-12) is approximately?

They've determined that the arrival of customers follows a Poisson process with an average rate of 6 customers per hour. The owner wants to understand the probabilities to help with staffing decisions.\n\n1. What is the probability of exactly 4 customers arriving during a randomly chosen hour?\n2. What is the probability of 8 or more customers arriving during a randomly chosen hour?\n3. If the bakery is open for 2 hours, what is the probability of exactly 10 customers arriving in total during this period? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem about a Poisson process at a small bakery. They track customers entering per hour, and they've figured out that the arrival follows a Poisson process with an average rate of 6 customers per hour. The owner wants to understand the probabilities for different scenarios to help with staffing decisions. There are three parts to this problem, and I need to solve each step by step.\n\nLet me start by recalling what a Poisson process is. From what I remember, a Poisson process is a counting process that counts the number of events occurring in a fixed interval. These events happen continuously and independently at a constant average rate. So, in this case, customers are arriving at an average rate of 6 per hour.\n\nThe Poisson probability formula is P(k) = (\u03bb^k * e^(-\u03bb)) / k!, where \u03bb is the average rate, k is the number of occurrences, and e is the base of the natural logarithm.\n\nAlright, let's tackle the first question: What is the probability of exactly 4 customers arriving during a randomly chosen hour?\n\nSo, for this, \u03bb is 6, and k is 4. Plugging into the formula, P(4) = (6^4 * e^(-6)) / 4!.\n\nLet me calculate that. First, compute 6^4. 6 squared is 36, so 36 squared is 1296. So, 6^4 is 1296.\n\nNext, compute e^(-6). I remember e is approximately 2.71828, so e^(-6) is 1 divided by e^6. Let me calculate e^6 first. e^2 is about 7.389, e^3 is about 20.085, e^4 is about 54.598, e^5 is about 148.413, and e^6 is approximately 403.4288. So, e^(-6) is 1 / 403.4288, which is approximately 0.002478752.\n\nNow, 4! is 24. So, putting it all together: P(4) = (1296 * 0.002478752) / 24.\n\nFirst, multiply 1296 by 0.002478752. Let me do that step by step. 1296 * 0.002 is 2.592, and 1296 * 0.000478752 is approximately 1296 * 0.0004 = 0.5184, and 1296 * 0.000078752 is roughly 0.1019. So adding those up: 2.592 + 0.5184 + 0.1019 \u2248 3.2123.\n\nWait, maybe I should calculate it more accurately. Let me do 1296 * 0.002478752.\n\nMultiplying 1296 by 0.002478752:\n\nFirst, 1296 * 0.002 = 2.592\n\nThen, 1296 * 0.0004 = 0.5184\n\nNext, 1296 * 0.00007 = 0.09072\n\nThen, 1296 * 0.000008752. Hmm, that's 1296 * 0.000008 = 0.010368, and 1296 * 0.000000752 is about 0.000975.\n\nAdding all these together: 2.592 + 0.5184 = 3.1104, plus 0.09072 = 3.20112, plus 0.010368 = 3.211488, plus 0.000975 \u2248 3.212463.\n\nSo, approximately 3.212463.\n\nNow, divide that by 24: 3.212463 / 24 \u2248 0.1338.\n\nSo, the probability is approximately 0.1338, which is about 13.38%.\n\nLet me check with a calculator to be precise. Wait, maybe I should use more accurate values.\n\nCompute 6^4: 6*6=36, 36*6=216, 216*6=1296. Correct.\n\nCompute e^(-6): Let me use more precise value. e^6 is approximately 403.428793, so e^(-6) \u2248 0.002478752.\n\nThen, P(4) = (1296 * 0.002478752) / 24.\n\nCompute 1296 * 0.002478752:\n\nLet me do it as 1296 * 0.002478752.\n\nFirst, 1296 * 2.478752 x 10^(-3).\n\nCalculate 1296 * 2.478752:\n\nLet's compute 1296 * 2 = 2592\n\n1296 * 0.4 = 518.4\n\n1296 * 0.07 = 90.72\n\n1296 * 0.008 = 10.368\n\n1296 * 0.000752 \u2248 0.975\n\nNow, adding all these:\n\n2592 + 518.4 = 3110.4\n\n3110.4 + 90.72 = 3201.12\n\n3201.12 + 10.368 = 3211.488\n\n3211.488 + 0.975 \u2248 3212.463\n\nSo, 1296 * 2.478752 = 3212.463\n\nTherefore, 1296 * 0.002478752 = 3212.463 x 10^(-3) = 3.212463.\n\nDivide by 24: 3.212463 / 24 \u2248 0.1338, so 0.1338.\n\nSo, approximately 0.1338, which is about 13.38%.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the probability is approximately 0.1338.\n\nMoving on to the second question: What is the probability of 8 or more customers arriving during a randomly chosen hour?\n\nSo, P(X \u2265 8) where X ~ Poisson(\u03bb=6).\n\nTo find this probability, it's easier to compute 1 - P(X \u2264 7), because the sum from k=0 to k=7 of P(k) is the probability of 7 or fewer customers, and subtracting that from 1 gives us the probability of 8 or more.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute the sum from k=8 to infinity, but since Poisson probabilities become very small as k increases, calculating up to a certain point where the terms are negligible might be sufficient.\n\nBut since it's a finite sum up to k=7, let's compute P(X \u2264 7) = sum from k=0 to 7 of P(k).\n\nI can compute each term and sum them up.\n\nLet me compute each P(k) for k=0 to 7.\n\nGiven \u03bb=6, P(k) = (6^k * e^(-6)) / k!\n\nSo, let me compute each term:\n\nk=0: P(0) = (6^0 * e^(-6)) / 0! = (1 * 0.002478752) / 1 = 0.002478752\n\nk=1: P(1) = (6^1 * e^(-6)) / 1! = (6 * 0.002478752) / 1 = 0.014872512\n\nk=2: P(2) = (6^2 * e^(-6)) / 2! = (36 * 0.002478752) / 2 = (0.089473472) / 2 = 0.044736736\n\nk=3: P(3) = (6^3 * e^(-6)) / 6 = (216 * 0.002478752) / 6 = (0.535443072) / 6 \u2248 0.089070512\n\nk=4: P(4) = (6^4 * e^(-6)) / 24 = (1296 * 0.002478752) / 24 \u2248 3.212463 / 24 \u2248 0.1338105\n\nWait, that's the same as in the first question, which is correct.\n\nk=5: P(5) = (6^5 * e^(-6)) / 120 = (7776 * 0.002478752) / 120\n\nCompute 7776 * 0.002478752:\n\nFirst, 7776 * 0.002 = 15.552\n\n7776 * 0.0004 = 3.1104\n\n7776 * 0.00007 = 0.54432\n\n7776 * 0.000008752 \u2248 7776 * 0.000008 = 0.062208, and 7776 * 0.000000752 \u2248 0.005846\n\nAdding these:\n\n15.552 + 3.1104 = 18.6624\n\n18.6624 + 0.54432 = 19.20672\n\n19.20672 + 0.062208 = 19.268928\n\n19.268928 + 0.005846 \u2248 19.274774\n\nSo, 7776 * 0.002478752 \u2248 19.274774\n\nDivide by 120: 19.274774 / 120 \u2248 0.1606237\n\nSo, P(5) \u2248 0.1606237\n\nk=6: P(6) = (6^6 * e^(-6)) / 720 = (46656 * 0.002478752) / 720\n\nCompute 46656 * 0.002478752:\n\nFirst, 46656 * 0.002 = 93.312\n\n46656 * 0.0004 = 18.6624\n\n46656 * 0.00007 = 3.26172\n\n46656 * 0.000008752 \u2248 46656 * 0.000008 = 0.373248, and 46656 * 0.000000752 \u2248 0.03507\n\nAdding these:\n\n93.312 + 18.6624 = 111.9744\n\n111.9744 + 3.26172 = 115.23612\n\n115.23612 + 0.373248 \u2248 115.609368\n\n115.609368 + 0.03507 \u2248 115.644438\n\nSo, 46656 * 0.002478752 \u2248 115.644438\n\nDivide by 720: 115.644438 / 720 \u2248 0.1605\n\nSo, P(6) \u2248 0.1605\n\nWait, that seems a bit high, but let's check:\n\nAlternatively, compute 46656 * 0.002478752 = ?\n\nAlternatively, note that 46656 is 6^6, and e^(-6) is 0.002478752.\n\nSo, P(6) = (6^6 * e^(-6)) / 720\n\nCompute 6^6 = 46656\n\nSo, (46656 * 0.002478752) / 720\n\nCalculate numerator: 46656 * 0.002478752\n\nLet me compute 46656 * 0.002 = 93.312\n\n46656 * 0.0004 = 18.6624\n\n46656 * 0.00007 = 3.26172\n\n46656 * 0.000008752 \u2248 46656 * 0.000008 = 0.373248, and 46656 * 0.000000752 \u2248 0.03507\n\nAdding up: 93.312 + 18.6624 = 111.9744\n\n111.9744 + 3.26172 = 115.23612\n\n115.23612 + 0.373248 = 115.609368\n\n115.609368 + 0.03507 \u2248 115.644438\n\nSo, numerator \u2248 115.644438\n\nDivide by 720: 115.644438 / 720 \u2248 0.1605\n\nSo, P(6) \u2248 0.1605\n\nk=7: P(7) = (6^7 * e^(-6)) / 5040 = (279936 * 0.002478752) / 5040\n\nCompute 279936 * 0.002478752:\n\nFirst, 279936 * 0.002 = 559.872\n\n279936 * 0.0004 = 111.9744\n\n279936 * 0.00007 = 19.64652\n\n279936 * 0.000008752 \u2248 279936 * 0.000008 = 2.239488, and 279936 * 0.000000752 \u2248 0.2109\n\nAdding these:\n\n559.872 + 111.9744 = 671.8464\n\n671.8464 + 19.64652 = 691.49292\n\n691.49292 + 2.239488 \u2248 693.732408\n\n693.732408 + 0.2109 \u2248 693.943308\n\nSo, numerator \u2248 693.943308\n\nDivide by 5040: 693.943308 / 5040 \u2248 0.1378\n\nSo, P(7) \u2248 0.1378\n\nNow, let's sum up all these probabilities from k=0 to k=7.\n\nCompute each P(k):\n\nk=0: 0.002478752\n\nk=1: 0.014872512\n\nk=2: 0.044736736\n\nk=3: 0.089070512\n\nk=4: 0.1338105\n\nk=5: 0.1606237\n\nk=6: 0.1605\n\nk=7: 0.1378\n\nNow, let's add them step by step.\n\nStart with 0.002478752 + 0.014872512 = 0.017351264\n\nAdd k=2: 0.017351264 + 0.044736736 = 0.062088\n\nAdd k=3: 0.062088 + 0.089070512 \u2248 0.151158512\n\nAdd k=4: 0.151158512 + 0.1338105 \u2248 0.284968\n\nAdd k=5: 0.284968 + 0.1606237 \u2248 0.4455917\n\nAdd k=6: 0.4455917 + 0.1605 \u2248 0.6060917\n\nAdd k=7: 0.6060917 + 0.1378 \u2248 0.7438917\n\nSo, P(X \u2264 7) \u2248 0.7438917\n\nTherefore, P(X \u22658) = 1 - 0.7438917 \u2248 0.2561083\n\nSo, approximately 0.2561, or 25.61%.\n\nLet me double-check these calculations because it's easy to make a mistake in adding so many small numbers.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the cumulative distribution function for Poisson, but since I don't have a calculator here, I'll proceed with the numbers I have.\n\nAlternatively, I can note that the sum of P(k) from 0 to 7 is approximately 0.7439, so P(8+) is about 0.2561.\n\nSo, the probability of 8 or more customers is approximately 0.2561.\n\nNow, moving on to the third question: If the bakery is open for 2 hours, what is the probability of exactly 10 customers arriving in total during this period?\n\nSo, now we're dealing with the sum of two independent Poisson random variables, each with \u03bb=6, over 2 hours.\n\nSo, if X ~ Poisson(6) is the number of customers in one hour, then the total number of customers in 2 hours is X + X' where X and X' are independent Poisson(6) variables.\n\nTherefore, the sum X + X' follows a Poisson distribution with \u03bb = 12, because for independent Poisson variables, the sum has parameters \u03bb1 + \u03bb2.\n\nSo, Y = X + X' ~ Poisson(\u03bb=12)\n\nWe need to find P(Y=10) = P(X + X' =10)\n\nTo compute this, we need to find the probability that the sum of two independent Poisson(6) variables equals 10.\n\nThe formula for the probability mass function of the sum of two Poisson variables is given by:\n\nP(Y=k) = sum over i=0 to k of [P(X=i) * P(X'=k-i)]\n\nSo, P(Y=10) = sum from i=0 to 10 of [P(X=i) * P(X'=10-i)]\n\nBut since X and X' are independent, this is correct.\n\nAlternatively, there is a more efficient way using the convolution of the Poisson distribution, but I think for the sake of this problem, we can compute it by summing the product of the individual probabilities.\n\nSo, let's compute each term from i=0 to i=10.\n\nGiven that \u03bb=6, P(X=i) = (6^i * e^(-6)) / i!\n\nSimilarly for P(X'=10-i) = (6^(10-i) * e^(-6)) / (10 - i)!\n\nTherefore, P(Y=10) = sum from i=0 to 10 of [ (6^i * e^(-6)) / i! * (6^(10-i) * e^(-6)) / (10 - i)! ) ]\n\nSimplify this expression:\n\nP(Y=10) = e^(-12) * sum from i=0 to 10 of [ (6^i * 6^(10-i)) / (i! (10 - i)! ) ]\n\nSimplify the numerator: 6^i * 6^(10-i) = 6^10\n\nSo, P(Y=10) = e^(-12) * 6^10 * sum from i=0 to10 of [ 1 / (i! (10 - i)! ) ]\n\nBut the sum from i=0 to10 of [1 / (i! (10 - i)! ) ] is equal to the binomial coefficient C(10, i), because 1 / (i! (10 -i)! ) = 1 / 10! * C(10, i)\n\nTherefore, sum from i=0 to10 of [1 / (i! (10 -i)! ) ] = sum from i=0 to10 of [ C(10, i) / 10! ] = (1 + 1)^10 / 10! = 2^10 / 10! because it's the sum of binomial coefficients.\n\nSo, P(Y=10) = e^(-12) * 6^10 * (2^10 / 10! )\n\nWait, let me verify that step.\n\nYes, because sum_{i=0}^{10} C(10,i) = 2^10.\n\nTherefore, sum_{i=0}^{10} [1 / (i!

They've determined that the arrival of customers follows a Poisson process with an average rate of 6 customers per hour. The owner wants to understand the probabilities to help with staffing decisions.\n\n1. What is the probability of exactly 4 customers arriving during a randomly chosen hour?\n2. What is the probability of 8 or more customers arriving during a randomly chosen hour?\n3. If the bakery is open for 2 hours, what is the probability of exactly 10 customers arriving in total during this period? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this problem about a Poisson process at a small bakery. The owner wants to figure out some probabilities related to the number of customers arriving each hour. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall what a Poisson process is. From what I remember, a Poisson process is a counting process that counts the number of events happening in a fixed interval of time. The key characteristics are that the number of events in disjoint intervals are independent, and the number of events in any interval follows a Poisson distribution. Also, the events occur independently at a constant average rate.\n\nIn this case, the bakery tracks customers arriving per hour, and it's given that the arrival rate is an average of 6 customers per hour. So, the Poisson process parameters are: the average rate \u03bb = 6 customers per hour. \n\nNow, the questions are:\n\n1. Probability of exactly 4 customers arriving in a randomly chosen hour.\n2. Probability of 8 or more customers arriving in a randomly chosen hour.\n3. Probability of exactly 10 customers arriving in 2 hours.\n\nLet me tackle each question one by one.\n\n**Question 1: Probability of exactly 4 customers arriving in an hour.**\n\nI know that the Poisson probability mass function is given by:\n\nP(X = k) = (\u03bb^k * e^(-\u03bb)) / k!\n\nWhere:\n- P(X = k) is the probability of k events.\n- \u03bb is the average rate (mean).\n- k is the number of occurrences.\n- e is the base of natural logarithm (approximately 2.71828).\n- k! is the factorial of k.\n\nSo, plugging in the values for the first question: \u03bb = 6, k = 4.\n\nP(X = 4) = (6^4 * e^(-6)) / 4!\n\nLet me compute each part step by step.\n\nFirst, compute 6^4:\n\n6^4 = 6 * 6 * 6 * 6 = 36 * 36 = 1296.\n\nNext, compute e^(-6). Since e^(-6) is approximately equal to 0.002478752.\n\nThen, compute 4!:\n\n4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24.\n\nNow, putting it all together:\n\nP(X = 4) = (1296 * 0.002478752) / 24.\n\nFirst, compute 1296 * 0.002478752.\n\nLet me do that multiplication:\n\n1296 * 0.002478752 \u2248 1296 * 0.002478752.\n\nWell, 1296 * 0.002 = 2.592.\n\n1296 * 0.000478752 \u2248 1296 * 0.0004 = 0.5184, and 1296 * 0.000078752 \u2248 approximately 0.1018.\n\nAdding those together: 0.5184 + 0.1018 \u2248 0.6202.\n\nSo, total \u2248 2.592 + 0.6202 \u2248 3.2122.\n\nWait, that seems a bit off because I think I should have done the exact multiplication.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use a calculator approach.\n\nBut since I don't have a calculator here, maybe I can approximate it differently.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute 1296 * 0.002478752.\n\nI can write 0.002478752 as approximately 0.00247875.\n\nSo, 1296 * 0.00247875.\n\nLet me compute 1296 * 0.002 = 2.592.\n\n1296 * 0.0004 = 0.5184.\n\n1296 * 0.00007 = 0.09072.\n\n1296 * 0.00000875 \u2248 0.01134.\n\nAdding these up: 2.592 + 0.5184 = 3.1104; 3.1104 + 0.09072 = 3.20112; 3.20112 + 0.01134 \u2248 3.21246.\n\nSo, approximately 3.21246.\n\nThen, divide that by 24.\n\n3.21246 / 24 \u2248 0.1338.\n\nSo, approximately 0.1338, or 13.38%.\n\nWait, let me check if that makes sense.\n\nSince the average rate is 6, the Poisson distribution should be skewed right, meaning higher probabilities towards higher numbers.\n\nAt k=4, which is less than the mean, the probability should be less than the peak, which is around 6 or 7.\n\nLooking at a Poisson table or using a calculator, for \u03bb=6, P(X=4) is approximately 0.1339, which is about 13.39%.\n\nSo, my calculation of approximately 0.1338 is very close to that. So, I think that's correct.\n\n**Question 2: Probability of 8 or more customers arriving in an hour.**\n\nThis is asking for P(X \u2265 8), which is the cumulative probability from 8 to infinity.\n\nOne way to compute this is to sum the probabilities from k=8 to k=\u221e, but that's not practical manually.

So, P(X \u22647) \u22480.74382, so P(X \u22658) \u2248 1 - 0.74382 \u2248 0.25618, which is approximately 25.62%.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes it's better to check using a calculator or a Poisson table, but since I don't have that here, I think this is correct.\n\n**Question 3: Probability of exactly 10 customers arriving in 2 hours.**\n\nNow, this is a bit different because it's over 2 hours. Since the process is Poisson, the number of customers in 2 hours is the sum of two independent Poisson random variables, each with \u03bb=6.\n\nSo, if X ~ Poisson(6) and Y ~ Poisson(6), then the sum X + Y ~ Poisson(12).\n\nWait, is that correct? Because if the process is over 2 hours, and the rate is 6 per hour, then over 2 hours, the expected number is 12.\n\nYes, so the sum of two independent Poisson(6) variables is Poisson(12).\n\nTherefore, the probability of exactly 10 customers in 2 hours is P(X + Y = 10), where X and Y ~ Poisson(6).\n\nAlternatively, we can model this as a convolution of the two Poisson distributions.\n\nBut computing the exact probability would involve summing over all k and m such that k + m = 10, of the products of the individual probabilities.\n\nThat is:\n\nP(X + Y = 10) = sum_{k=0}^{10} P(X=k) * P(Y=10 - k)\n\nBut that's a bit tedious, but manageable.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the formula for the sum of two independent Poisson variables:\n\nP(X + Y = n) = sum_{k=0}^n [ (\u03bb^k * e^(-\u03bb)) / k! ] * [ (\u03bb^{n -k} * e^(-\u03bb)) / (n -k)! ) ]\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nsum_{k=0}^n [ \u03bb^n * e^(-2\u03bb) ] / (k! (n -k)! )\n\nBut in this case, n=10, \u03bb=6.\n\nSo, P(X + Y = 10) = sum_{k=0}^{10} [6^{10} * e^(-12)] / (k! (10 -k)! )\n\nAlternatively, this is equivalent to the coefficient of x^{10} in the expansion of (e^{\u03bb x} * e^{\u03bb x}) / (\u03bb!)^{2}, but that might not help directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the Poisson distribution properties.\n\nWait, another approach is to recognize that the sum of two Poisson variables is Poisson with parameter \u03bb1 + \u03bb2, which is 12 in this case. So, the distribution of X + Y is Poisson(12).\n\nTherefore, P(X + Y =10) = P(Z=10), where Z ~ Poisson(12).\n\nSo, we can compute this directly using the Poisson PMF with \u03bb=12, k=10.\n\nSo, P(Z=10) = (12^{10} * e^{-12}) / 10!\n\nLet me compute that.\n\nFirst, compute 12^{10}.\n\n12^1 =12\n\n12^2=144\n\n12^3=1728\n\n12^4=20736\n\n12^5=248832\n\n12^6=2985984\n\n12^7=35831808\n\n12^8=429981696\n\n12^9=5159780352\n\n12^{10}=61917364224\n\nSo, 12^{10}=61,917,364,224\n\ne^{-12} \u2248 0.000006737947 \u2248 6.737947 x10^{-6}\n\n10! = 3,628,800\n\nSo, P(Z=10) = (61,917,364,224 * 0.000006737947) / 3,628,800\n\nFirst, compute numerator: 61,917,364,224 * 0.000006737947\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n61,917,364,224 * 6.737947 x10^{-6} \u2248\n\nFirst, 61,917,364,224 * 6.737947 \u2248 let me compute:\n\n61,917,364,224 * 6 = 371,504,184,344\n\n61,917,364,224 * 0.737947 \u2248 let's compute 61,917,364,224 * 0.7 = 43,593,855,556.8\n\n61,917,364,224 * 0.037947 \u2248 approx 61,917,364,224 * 0.03 = 1,857,521,926.72, and 61,917,364,224 * 0.007947 \u2248 approx 61,917,364,224 * 0.008 = 495,338,931.392, so subtract a bit: 495,338,931.392 - (61,917,364,224 * 0.000053) \u2248 495,338,931.392 - 3,293,000 \u2248 492,045,931.392\n\nSo, total for 0.737947 \u2248 43,593,855,556.8 + 1,857,521,926.72 + 492,045,931.392 \u2248 43,593,855,556.8 + 2,349,567,858.112 \u2248 45,943,423,414.912\n\nSo, total numerator \u2248 371,504,184,344 + 45,943,423,414.912 \u2248 417,447,607,758.912\n\nBut wait,"

    "solution": "Solve this problem step by step. End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: A small bakery tracks the number of customers who enter per hour. They've determined that the arrival of customers follows a Poisson process with an average rate of 6 customers per hour. The owner wants to understand the probabilities to help with staffing decisions.\n\n1. What is the probability of exactly 4 customers arriving during a randomly chosen hour?\n2. What is the probability of 8 or more customers arriving during a randomly chosen hour?\n3. If the bakery is open for 2 hours, what is the probability of exactly 10 customers arriving in total during this period? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this problem about a bakery tracking customer arrivals using a Poisson process. Let's break it down step by step. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what a Poisson process is. From what I remember, a Poisson process is a counting process that counts the number of events happening in a fixed interval of time. It's characterized by the rate parameter, which here is given as 6 customers per hour. That means on average, 6 customers arrive every hour.\n\nThe Poisson probability formula is P(k; \u03bb) = (e^(-\u03bb) * \u03bb^k) / k!, where \u03bb is the average rate (which is 6 in this case), and k is the number of occurrences we're interested in.\n\nSo, for the first question: What is the probability of exactly 4 customers arriving during a randomly chosen hour?\n\nLet me plug in the numbers into the Poisson formula. Here, k is 4 and \u03bb is 6. So, P(4) = (e^(-6) * 6^4) / 4!. I can calculate that step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate e^(-6). I remember that e^(-6) is approximately 0.002478752. Then, 6^4 is 1296. And 4! is 24. So, P(4) = (0.002478752 * 1296) / 24. Let me compute that: 0.002478752 * 1296 = 3.227. Then divide by 24: 3.227 / 24 \u2248 0.1343, or about 13.43%.\n\nOkay, that seems reasonable. So, the probability is approximately 13.43%.\n\nMoving on to the second question: What is the probability of 8 or more customers arriving during a randomly chosen hour?\n\nHmm, so that's the probability that k is 8, 9, 10, ..., up to whatever. Since the Poisson distribution is discrete, we have to sum these probabilities from k=8 to infinity. But since the rate is 6, and Poisson probabilities drop off exponentially, I can probably calculate the cumulative probability from 8 onwards by subtracting the probability of k < 8 from 1.\n\nSo, P(k >= 8) = 1 - P(k <= 7). Let's compute P(k <=7) by summing from k=0 to 7. But calculating each term individually might be tedious. Alternatively, I can use the cumulative distribution function (CDF) for Poisson, which gives P(k <= m) = e^(-\u03bb) * sum_{i=0}^m (\u03bb^i)/i!\n\nSo, let me compute that. First, compute e^(-6) which is approximately 0.002478752. Then, compute the sum from i=0 to 7 of (6^i)/i!.\n\nLet's compute each term:\n\nFor i=0: (6^0)/0! = 1/1 = 1\n\ni=1: 6/1 = 6\n\ni=2: 36/2 = 18\n\ni=3: 216/6 = 36\n\ni=4: 1296/24 = 54\n\ni=5: 7776/120 = 64.8\n\ni=6: 46656/720 = 64.8\n\ni=7: 279936/5040 \u2248 55.36\n\nNow, sum all these up:\n\n1 + 6 = 7\n\n7 + 18 = 25\n\n25 + 36 = 61\n\n61 + 54 = 115\n\n115 + 64.8 = 179.8\n\n179.8 + 64.8 = 244.6\n\n244.6 + 55.36 \u2248 299.96\n\nSo, the sum is approximately 299.96. Then, P(k <=7) = e^(-6) * 299.96 \u2248 0.002478752 * 299.96 \u2248 0.742.\n\nTherefore, P(k >=8) = 1 - 0.742 \u2248 0.258, or about 25.8%.\n\nWait, that seems a bit low. Let me double-check the sum. Maybe I made a calculation error.\n\nWait, when i=5: 6^5 is 7776, and 7776 divided by 120 (which is 5!) is indeed 64.8.\n\ni=6: 6^6 is 46656, divided by 720 (6!) is 64.8.\n\ni=7: 6^7 is 279936, divided by 5040 (7!) is approximately 55.36.\n\nAdding them up again:\n\n1 + 6 = 7\n\n7 + 18 = 25\n\n25 + 36 = 61\n\n61 + 54 = 115\n\n115 + 64.8 = 179.8\n\n179.8 + 64.8 = 244.6\n\n244.6 + 55.36 = 299.96\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the sum is about 299.96. Multiply by e^(-6): 0.002478752 * 299.96 \u2248 0.742.\n\nSo, P(k >=8) \u2248 1 - 0.742 \u2248 0.258, or 25.8%. That seems plausible.\n\nNow, the third question: If the bakery is open for 2 hours, what is the probability of exactly 10 customers arriving in total during this period?\n\nHmm, since it's a Poisson process, the number of customers arriving in 2 hours can be modeled as a Poisson process with \u03bb = 6 * 2 = 12. So, we're looking for P(k=10) where \u03bb=12.\n\nSo, using the Poisson formula again: P(10) = (e^(-12) * 12^10) / 10!.\n\nFirst, compute e^(-12).

    "solution": "Solve this problem step by step. End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: A small bakery tracks the number of customers who enter per hour. They've determined that the arrival of customers follows a Poisson process with an average rate of 6 customers per hour. The owner wants to understand the probabilities to help with staffing decisions.\n\n1. What is the probability of exactly 4 customers arriving during a randomly chosen hour?\n2. What is the probability of 8 or more customers arriving during a randomly chosen hour?\n3. If the bakery is open for 2 hours, what is the probability of exactly 10 customers arriving in total during this period? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I need to solve these Poisson process probability questions. Let's take them one by one. \n\nStarting with question 1: What's the probability of exactly 4 customers arriving during a randomly chosen hour when the average rate is 6 customers per hour? \n\nOkay, I remember that the Poisson probability formula is used here. The formula is:\n\nP(k) = (\u03bb^k * e^(-\u03bb)) / k!\n\nWhere \u03bb is the average rate, which is 6 in this case, and k is the number of customers, which is 4.\n\nSo plugging in the numbers:\n\nP(4) = (6^4 * e^(-6)) / 4!\n\nFirst, let's compute 6^4. 6 squared is 36, and 36 squared is 1296. So 6^4 is 1296.\n\nNext, 4! is 4 factorial, which is 4*3*2*1 = 24.\n\nSo now we have 1296 * e^(-6) / 24.\n\nI need to calculate e^(-6). I remember e^(-6) is approximately 0.002478752.\n\nSo plugging that in:\n\nP(4) \u2248 (1296 * 0.002478752) / 24\n\nFirst, multiply 1296 by 0.002478752. Let me do that step by step.\n\n1296 * 0.002478752 \u2248 1296 * 0.002478752 \u2248 Let's approximate this.\n\n1296 * 0.002 = 2.592\n\n1296 * 0.000478752 \u2248 Approximately 1296 * 0.0004 = 0.5184, and 1296 * 0.000078752 \u2248 about 0.102. So total \u2248 0.5184 + 0.102 \u2248 0.6204.\n\nSo adding that to the 2.592, we get approximately 2.592 + 0.6204 \u2248 3.2124.\n\nNow, divide that by 24: 3.2124 / 24 \u2248 0.1343.\n\nSo approximately 0.1343, or 13.43%.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high for exactly 4 customers when the average is 6. Maybe I made a calculation error.\n\nLet me double-check the multiplication:\n\n1296 * 0.002478752.\n\nLet me compute 1296 * 0.002 = 2.592.\n\n1296 * 0.000478752.\n\nFirst, 1296 * 0.0004 = 0.5184.\n\n1296 * 0.000078752 \u2248 Let's compute 1296 * 0.00007 = 0.09072, and 1296 * 0.000008752 \u2248 approximately 0.01132.\n\nSo adding those: 0.09072 + 0.01132 \u2248 0.10204.\n\nSo total for 0.000478752 is approximately 0.5184 + 0.10204 \u2248 0.62044.\n\nAdding that to 2.592 gives 2.592 + 0.62044 \u2248 3.21244.\n\nDivide by 24: 3.21244 / 24 \u2248 0.1343.\n\nSo that seems correct. Alternatively, maybe I can use a calculator for better precision, but I think that's close enough for now.\n\nMoving on to question 2: Probability of 8 or more customers arriving during a randomly chosen hour.\n\nHmm, so that's the sum of probabilities from k=8 to infinity. Since Poisson probabilities sum to 1, we can use the complement: 1 - P(k \u22647).\n\nSo P(k \u22658) = 1 - P(k \u22647).\n\nI can compute P(k \u22647) by summing from k=0 to 7, but that's tedious. Alternatively, I can compute 1 - P(k \u22647) directly, which might be easier.\n\nBut to compute it accurately, maybe I should calculate each term up to k=7 and sum them.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for the cumulative distribution function for Poisson.\n\nBut perhaps using the formula recursively or using a calculator would be better. Since I'm doing this manually, let's compute each term.\n\nFirst, compute P(k) for k=0 to 7.\n\nGiven \u03bb=6.\n\nCompute each P(k):\n\nP(0) = (6^0 * e^(-6)) / 0! = (1 * e^(-6)) / 1 \u2248 0.002478752\n\nP(1) = (6^1 * e^(-6)) / 1! = 6 * 0.002478752 \u2248 0.014872512\n\nP(2) = (6^2 * e^(-6)) / 2! = 36 * 0.002478752 / 2 \u2248 36 * 0.001239376 \u2248 0.044543136\n\nP(3) = (6^3 * e^(-6)) / 6 \u2248 216 * 0.002478752 / 6 \u2248 (216 /6)*0.002478752 \u2248 36 * 0.002478752 \u2248 0.089082912\n\nP(4) we already calculated as \u22480.1343.\n\nP(5) = (6^5 * e^(-6)) / 5! = 7776 * 0.002478752 / 120\n\nWait, 6^5 is 7776, and 5! is 120.\n\nSo 7776 / 120 = 64.8\n\nSo 64.8 * 0.002478752 \u2248 Let's compute 64 * 0.002478752 \u2248 0.159, and 0.8 * 0.002478752 \u2248 0.001982.

    "solution": "Solve this problem step by step. End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: A small bakery tracks the number of customers who enter per hour. They've determined that the arrival of customers follows a Poisson process with an average rate of 6 customers per hour. The owner wants to understand the probabilities to help with staffing decisions.\n\n1. What is the probability of exactly 4 customers arriving during a randomly chosen hour?\n2. What is the probability of 8 or more customers arriving during a randomly chosen hour?\n3. If the bakery is open for 2 hours, what is the probability of exactly 10 customers arriving in total during this period? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I need to solve these three probability questions related to a Poisson process. I remember that a Poisson process is a counting process that counts the number of events occurring in a fixed interval. It's characterized by a constant average rate and independent increments. The rate here is given as 6 customers per hour.\n\nLet me start with the first question: What is the probability of exactly 4 customers arriving during a randomly chosen hour?\n\nOkay, so for a Poisson distribution, the probability mass function is given by the formula:\n\nP(k) = (\u03bb^k * e^(-\u03bb)) / k!\n\nWhere \u03bb is the average rate (which is 6 in this case), k is the number of occurrences we're interested in (which is 4 here), and \"e\" is the base of the natural logarithm.\n\nSo plugging in the numbers, we have:\n\nP(4) = (6^4 * e^(-6)) / 4!\n\nFirst, let me calculate 6^4. 6 squared is 36, so 36 squared is 1296. So 6^4 is 1296.\n\nNext, e^(-6). I remember that e^(-6) is approximately 0.002478752.\n\nThen, 4! is 24.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nP(4) = (1296 * 0.002478752) / 24\n\nLet me compute the numerator first: 1296 * 0.002478752. Hmm, let me see. 1296 * 0.002 is 2.592, and 1296 * 0.000478752 is approximately 0.619. So adding those together, roughly 2.592 + 0.619 = 3.211.\n\nWait, that seems a bit off. Maybe I should do it more accurately.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute 1296 * 0.002478752.\n\nFirst, 1296 * 0.002 = 2.592.\n\nThen, 1296 * 0.0004 = 0.5184.\n\nThen, 1296 * 0.000078752. Let's see, 1296 * 0.00007 = 0.09072, and 1296 * 0.000008752 \u2248 0.0113. So adding those: 0.09072 + 0.0113 \u2248 0.102.\n\nSo adding all parts: 2.592 + 0.5184 + 0.102 \u2248 3.2124.\n\nWait, but I think I might have miscalculated because 0.002478752 is equal to 0.002 + 0.0004 + 0.000078752. So adding those correctly:\n\n0.002 * 1296 = 2.592\n\n0.0004 * 1296 = 0.5184\n\n0.000078752 * 1296 \u2248 0.102 (as above)\n\nSo total is 2.592 + 0.5184 = 3.1104 + 0.102 \u2248 3.2124.\n\nSo numerator is approximately 3.2124.\n\nThen divide by 24: 3.2124 / 24 \u2248 0.1338.\n\nSo approximately 0.1338, or 13.38%.\n\nWait, let me check with a calculator approach.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 6^4 = 1296, e^(-6) \u2248 0.002478752, and 4! = 24.\n\nSo P(4) = (1296 * 0.002478752) / 24.\n\nLet me compute 1296 * 0.002478752 first.\n\n1296 * 0.002 = 2.592\n\n1296 * 0.000478752 = Let's compute 1296 * 0.0004 = 0.5184, and 1296 * 0.000078752 \u2248 0.102 (as before)\n\nSo total for 0.000478752 is 0.5184 + 0.102 \u2248 0.6204\n\nSo total numerator: 2.592 + 0.6204 \u2248 3.2124\n\nThen, 3.2124 / 24 \u2248 0.1338\n\nSo yes, approximately 0.1338.\n\nSo the probability is about 0.1338, which is 13.38%.\n\nI think that's reasonable. Since the average rate is 6, the probabilities should be highest around 6, so 4 is somewhat on the lower side, but not too low.\n\nOkay, moving on to the second question: What is the probability of 8 or more customers arriving during a randomly chosen hour?\n\nHmm, so that's P(X \u2265 8). For a Poisson distribution, that's the sum from k=8 to infinity of P(k). But since the average rate is 6, the probabilities will become very small as k increases beyond 6, so maybe we can compute up to some point where the terms become negligible.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the complementary probability: P(X \u2265 8) = 1 - P(X \u2264 7). That might be easier because we can compute P(0) + P(1) + ... + P(7) and subtract that from 1.\n\nLet me calculate P(X \u2264 7) and then subtract from 1.\n\nCompute each term:\n\nP(0) = (6^0 * e^(-6)) / 0! = (1 * 0.002478752) / 1 = 0.002478752\n\nP(1) = (6^1 * e^(-6)) / 1! = 6 * 0.002478752 / 1 = 0.014872512\n\nP(2) = (6^2 * e^(-6)) / 2! = 36 * 0.002478752 / 2 \u2248 36 * 0.001239376 \u2248 0.044776096\n\nWait, let me compute that again: 36 / 2 = 18, so 18 * 0.002478752 \u2248 0.044776096\n\nP(3) = (6^3 * e^(-6)) / 6 = 216 * 0.002478752 / 6\n\n216 / 6 = 36, so 36 * 0.002478752 \u2248 0.089065472\n\nP(4) we already calculated as \u22480.1338\n\nP(5) = (6^5 * e^(-6)) / 5! = 7776 * 0.002478752 / 120\n\nWait, 6^5 is 7776, and 5! is 120.\n\nSo 7776 / 120 = 64.8\n\nSo 64.8 * 0.002478752 \u2248 64.8 * 0.002478752 \u2248 let's compute 64 * 0.002478752 = 0.1593, and 0.8 * 0.002478752 \u2248 0.001982, so total \u2248 0.1613\n\nWait, no, that's not right. Wait, 64.8 * 0.002478752.\n\nLet me compute 64 * 0.002478752 = 64 * 0.002 = 0.128, and 64 * 0.000478752 \u2248 0.0306, so total \u2248 0.128 + 0.0306 \u2248 0.1586\n\nThen 0.8 * 0.002478752 \u2248 0.001982, so total P(5) \u2248 0.1586 + 0.001982 \u2248 0.1606\n\nSimilarly, P(6) = (6^6 * e^(-6)) / 6! = 46656 * 0.002478752 / 720\n\nCompute 46656 / 720. Let me see, 720 * 64 = 46080, so 46656 - 46080 = 576, so 720 goes into 576 0.8 times. So total is 64.8.\n\nSo P(6) = 64.8 * 0.002478752 \u2248 same as P(5), which was approximately 0.1606\n\nWait, that seems a bit high, but let's check.\n\nWait, 46656 / 720 = 64.8, correct.\n\nSo 64.8 * 0.002478752 \u2248 64.8 * 0.002478752.\n\nLet me compute 64 * 0.002478752 = 0.1586 (as above)\n\n0.8 * 0.002478752 \u2248 0.001982\n\nSo total \u2248 0.1586 + 0.001982 \u2248 0.1606\n\nSo P(6) \u2248 0.1606\n\nNow, P(7) = (6^7 * e^(-6)) / 7! = 279936 * 0.002478752 / 5040\n\nCompute 279936 / 5040.\n\n5040 * 55 = 277200, so 279936 - 277200 = 2736\n\n2736 / 5040 = 0.542857\n\nSo total is 55.542857\n\nSo P(7) = 55.542857 * 0.002478752 \u2248\n\nCompute 55 * 0.002478752 = 0.1363\n\n0.542857 * 0.002478752 \u2248 0.001346\n\nSo total \u2248 0.1363 + 0.001346 \u2248 0.1376\n\nWait, that seems a bit high, but let's accept it for now.\n\nSo now, let's sum up P(0) to P(7):\n\nP(0) = 0.002478752\n\nP(1) = 0.014872512\n\nP(2) \u2248 0.044776096\n\nP(3) \u2248 0.089065472\n\nP(4) \u2248 0.1338\n\nP(5) \u2248 0.1606\n\nP(6) \u2248 0.1606\n\nP(7) \u2248 0.1376\n\nLet me add these up step by step.\n\nStart with P(0): 0.002478752\n\nAdd P(1): 0.002478752 + 0.014872512 \u2248 0.017351264\n\nAdd P(2): 0.017351264 + 0.044776096 \u2248 0.06212736\n\nAdd P(3): 0.06212736 + 0.089065472 \u2248 0.151192832\n\nAdd P(4): 0.151192832 + 0.1338 \u2248 0.2850\n\nWait, 0.151192832 + 0.1338 = 0.2850 (approximately)\n\nAdd P(5): 0.2850 + 0.1606 \u2248 0.4456\n\nAdd P(6): 0.4456 + 0.1606 \u2248 0.6062\n\nAdd P(7): 0.6062 + 0.1376 \u2248 0.7438\n\nSo P(X \u22647) \u2248 0.7438\n\nTherefore, P(X \u22658) = 1 - 0.7438 \u2248 0.2562\n\nSo approximately 25.62%.\n\nThat seems plausible. Since the average is 6, the probability of more than 6 is about 25.6%, which makes sense because the distribution is symmetric around the mean in a Poisson distribution? Wait, no, Poisson isn't symmetric, but it does have the property that the probability of being above the mean is about 0.5.\n\nWait, but here we're looking at 8 or more, which is two units above the mean. So the probability should be less than 0.5, which it is, about 0.2562.\n\nAlternatively, I can check the cumulative probabilities using a Poisson table or a calculator, but I think my calculations are reasonable.\n\nNow, the third question: If the bakery is open for 2 hours, what is the probability of exactly 10 customers arriving in total during this period?\n\nOkay, so this is a Poisson process over 2 hours. Since the process is stationary and independent over intervals, the number of customers in 2 hours follows a Poisson distribution with \u03bb = 2*6 = 12.\n\nBecause for independent periods, the total is the sum of Poisson variables, which is also Poisson with \u03bb equal to the sum of individual \u03bbs.\n\nSo the number of customers in 2 hours, X ~ Poisson(12).\n\nWe need P(X =10).\n\nUsing the Poisson PMF again:\n\nP(10) = (12^10 * e^(-12)) / 10!\n\nCompute this.\n\nFirst, compute 12^10. Let me see, 12^2=144, 12^3=1728, 12^4=20736, 12^5=248832, 12^6=2985984, 12^7=35831808, 12^8=429981696, 12^9=5159780352, 12^10=61917364224.\n\nWait, that's a big number. Let me confirm:\n\n12^1=12\n\n12^2=144\n\n12^3=1728\n\n12^4=20736\n\n12^5=248832\n\n12^6=2,985,984\n\n12^7=35,831,808\n\n12^8=429,981,696\n\n12^9=5,159,780,352\n\n12^10=61,917,364,224\n\nYes, so 12^10 = 61,917,364,224\n\ne^(-12) \u2248 0.0000067379\n\n10! = 3,628,800\n\nSo P(10) = (61,917,364,224 * 0.0000067379) / 3,628,800\n\nFirst, compute the numerator: 61,917,364,224 * 0.0000067379\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nFirst, 61,917,364,224 * 0.000006 = 61,917,364,224 * 6e-6 = approx 61,917,364,224 * 0.000006 = 371,503.184\n\nThen, 61,917,364,224 * 0.0000007379 \u2248 Let's compute 61,917,364,224 * 0.0000007 = 61,917,364,224 * 7e-7 \u2248 4,362,254.368\n\nAnd 61,917,364,224 * 0.0000000379 \u2248 approx 61,917,364,224 * 3.79e-8 \u2248 approx 2,349,548. So total is approx 4,362,254.368 + 2,349,548 \u2248 6,711,802.368\n\nSo total numerator \u2248 371,503.184 + 6,711,802.368 \u2248 6,083,305.552\n\nWait, but that's probably not precise. Let me do it more accurately.\n\nAlternatively, use exponent rules.\n\nWait, 0.0000067379 is 6.7379e-6.\n\nSo 61,917,364,224 * 6.7379e-6.\n\nCompute 61,917,364,224 * 6e-6 = 61,917,364,224 * 0.000006 = 371,503.184\n\nCompute 61,917,364,224 * 0.0000007379 \u2248 61,917,364,224 * 0.0000007379\n\nLet me compute 61,917,364,224 * 0.0000007 = 61,917,364,224 * 7e-7 \u2248 4,362,254.368\n\nAnd 61,917,364,224 * 0.0000000379 \u2248 61,917,364,224 * 3.79e-8 \u2248 2,349,548. So total \u2248 4,362,254.368 + 2,349,548 \u2248 6,711,802.368\n\nSo total numerator \u2248 371,503.184 + 6,711,802.368 \u2248 6,083,305.552\n\nThen, divide by 3,628,800:\n\n6,083,305.552 / 3,628,800 \u2248 Let's see.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 1000: 6083.305552 / 3628.8 \u2248\n\nCompute 3628.8 * 1.68 \u2248 3628.8*1=3628.8, 3628.8*0.6=2177.28, 3628.8*0.08=290.304, so total \u2248 3628.8 + 2177.28 + 290.304 \u2248 6106.384\n\nWhich is close to 6083.305552, so approximately 1.68 - a bit less.\n\nCompute 3628.8 * 1.68 = 6106.384\n\nDifference: 6083.305552 - 6106.384 \u2248 -23.078\n\nSo, 1.68 - (23.078 / 3628.8) \u2248 1.68 - 0.00635 \u2248 1.67365\n\nSo approximately 1.67365\n\nSo P(10) \u2248 1.67365 / 1000? Wait, no, wait:\n\nWait, earlier step: numerator was 6,083,305.552, denominator is 3,628,800.\n\nSo 6,083,305.552 / 3,628,800 \u2248 Let me compute 3,628,800 * 1.67365 \u2248 3,628,800 * 1 = 3,628,800, 3,628,800 * 0.6 = 2,177,280, 3,628,800 * 0.07 = 254,016, 3,628,800 * 0.00365 \u2248 13,245.6\n\nSo total \u2248 3,628,800 + 2,177,280 = 5,806,080 + 254,016 = 6,060,096 + 13,245.6 \u2248 6,073,341.6\n\nWhich is close to 6,083,305.552, so the ratio is approximately 1.67365 + (6,083,305.552 - 6,073,341.6)/3,628,800\n\nDifference: 6,083,305.552 - 6,073,341.6 \u2248 9,963.952\n\nSo 9,963.952 / 3,628,800 \u2248 0.00275\n\nSo total \u2248 1.67365 + 0.00275 \u2248"
