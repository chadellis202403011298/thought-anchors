  "question": "A small bakery tracks the number of customers who enter per hour. They've determined that the arrival of customers follows a Poisson process with an average rate of 6 customers per hour. The owner wants to understand the probabilities to help with staffing decisions.\n\n1. What is the probability of exactly 4 customers arriving during a randomly chosen hour?\n2. What is the probability of 8 or more customers arriving during a randomly chosen hour?\n3. If the bakery is open for 2 hours, what is the probability of exactly 10 customers arriving in total during this period?",
  "answer": "Let's denote X as the random variable representing the number of customers arriving in one hour. Since customer arrivals follow a Poisson process with rate \u03bb = 6 customers per hour, X has a Poisson distribution with parameter \u03bb = 6.\n\nFor a Poisson random variable X with parameter \u03bb, the probability mass function is:\nP(X = k) = (e^(-\u03bb) \u00d7 \u03bb^k) / k!\n\n1. For the probability of exactly 4 customers arriving in one hour:\nP(X = 4) = (e^(-6) \u00d7 6^4) / 4!\nP(X = 4) = (e^(-6) \u00d7 1296) / 24\nP(X = 4) = 0.1342\n\n2. For the probability of 8 or more customers arriving in one hour:\nP(X \u2265 8) = 1 - P(X \u2264 7)\nP(X \u2264 7) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + P(X = 2) + ... + P(X = 7)\n\nLet's calculate each term:\nP(X = 0) = e^(-6) = 0.0025\nP(X = 1) = (e^(-6) \u00d7 6^1) / 1! = 0.0149\nP(X = 2) = (e^(-6) \u00d7 6^2) / 2! = 0.0446\nP(X = 3) = (e^(-6) \u00d7 6^3) / 3! = 0.0892\nP(X = 4) = (e^(-6) \u00d7 6^4) / 4! = 0.1342\nP(X = 5) = (e^(-6) \u00d7 6^5) / 5! = 0.1610\nP(X = 6) = (e^(-6) \u00d7 6^6) / 6! = 0.1610\nP(X = 7) = (e^(-6) \u00d7 6^7) / 7! = 0.1377\n\nP(X \u2264 7) = 0.0025 + 0.0149 + 0.0446 + 0.0892 + 0.1342 + 0.1610 + 0.1610 + 0.1377 = 0.7451\nP(X \u2265 8) = 1 - 0.7451 = 0.2549\n\n3. For a 2-hour period, we need to consider that the Poisson process has the property of having independent increments. The number of arrivals in a 2-hour period follows a Poisson distribution with parameter \u03bb = 6 \u00d7 2 = 12.\n\nSo if Y is the number of customers arriving in 2 hours, Y ~ Poisson(12).\nP(Y = 10) = (e^(-12) \u00d7 12^10) / 10!\nP(Y = 10) = (e^(-12) \u00d7 6.1917 \u00d7 10^10) / 3,628,800\nP(Y = 10) = 0.1048\n\nTherefore:\n1. The probability of exactly 4 customers arriving in one hour is 0.1342 or about 13.42%.\n2. The probability of 8 or more customers arriving in one hour is 0.2549 or about 25.49%.\n3. The probability of exactly 10 customers arriving during a 2-hour period is 0.1048 or about 10.48%."
