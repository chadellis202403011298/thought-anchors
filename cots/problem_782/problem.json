  "question": "Six identical squares are arranged to form a 3D cube. Each face of the cube is painted a different color: red, blue, green, yellow, white, and black. After the paint dries, the cube is unfolded back into a net (a connected 2D arrangement of the six squares). If red is at the center of the net, and blue is directly above red, which color cannot be adjacent to red in any valid net of the cube?",
  "answer": "Step 1: First, let's understand what we know about the cube:\n- Six different colored faces: red, blue, green, yellow, white, and black\n- Red is at the center of the unfolded net\n- Blue is directly above red (meaning blue and red share an edge in the cube)\n\nStep 2: When a cube is unfolded into a net, each face can only be adjacent to the faces it shares an edge with in the 3D cube.\n\nStep 3: In a cube, each face shares an edge with exactly four other faces. Red shares edges with blue, and with three other colors (not all five other colors).\n\nStep 4: In a cube, opposite faces never share an edge. Since red is at the center of the net and blue is adjacent to red, the face opposite to blue can never be adjacent to red in any net.\n\nStep 5: The opposite face to blue cannot be determined from the given information. However, we can determine that exactly one of the colors (green, yellow, white, or black) must be opposite to blue, and therefore cannot be adjacent to red in any valid net of the cube.\n\nStep 6: Since opposite faces of a cube never share an edge, the color opposite to blue cannot be adjacent to red in the net.\n\nThe answer is: The color opposite to blue (which is one of green, yellow, white, or black) cannot be adjacent to red in any valid net of the cube."
