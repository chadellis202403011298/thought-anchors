  "question": "In a classroom of 25 students, each student must choose exactly one elective subject from a list of 4 options: Art, Music, Drama, or Computer Science. Prove that at least 7 students must choose the same elective subject.",
  "answer": "This problem can be solved using the Pigeonhole Principle.\n\nWe have 25 students (the pigeons) who must be distributed among 4 elective subjects (the pigeonholes).\n\nStep 1: Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that no more than 6 students choose any single elective subject.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the maximum number of students possible under this assumption:\n4 elective subjects \u00d7 6 students per subject = 24 students maximum\n\nStep 3: However, we have 25 students in the classroom, which exceeds our maximum of 24 students calculated in Step 2.\n\nStep 4: This contradiction shows that our assumption must be false. Therefore, at least one of the elective subjects must be chosen by at least 7 students.\n\nAlternative approach using the formal Pigeonhole Principle formula:\nWhen n items are placed into m containers, at least one container must have at least \u2308n/m\u2309 items, where \u2308x\u2309 represents the ceiling function (the smallest integer greater than or equal to x).\n\nIn this problem:\n- n = 25 (students)\n- m = 4 (elective subjects)\n- \u2308n/m\u2309 = \u230825/4\u2309 = \u23086.25\u2309 = 7\n\nTherefore, at least one elective subject must be chosen by at least 7 students."
