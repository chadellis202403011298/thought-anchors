  "question": "In a symbolic language, the following equations are true:\n\n\u2660 + \u2665 = \u2605\n\u2665 \u00d7 \u2663 = \u25c6\n\u2605 - \u2663 = \u2660\n\u25c6 \u00f7 \u2665 = ?\n\nWhat symbol should replace the question mark?",
  "answer": "To solve this problem, I need to identify the relationships between symbols and determine what \u25c6 \u00f7 \u2665 equals.\n\nFrom the given equations:\n1. \u2660 + \u2665 = \u2605\n2. \u2665 \u00d7 \u2663 = \u25c6\n3. \u2605 - \u2663 = \u2660\n\nI'll work with these relationships to find \u25c6 \u00f7 \u2665.\n\nFrom equation 2, we know that \u25c6 = \u2665 \u00d7 \u2663\nSo \u25c6 \u00f7 \u2665 = (\u2665 \u00d7 \u2663) \u00f7 \u2665 = \u2663\n\nTherefore, the symbol that should replace the question mark is \u2663."
