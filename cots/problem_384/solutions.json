That is, prove that 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2n-1) = n\u00b2 for all positive integers n. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I need to prove by mathematical induction that the sum of the first n positive odd integers equals n squared. Hmm, okay, let me recall how mathematical induction works. From what I remember, it involves two main steps: the base case and the inductive step. \n\nFirst, I should check the base case, which is usually n=1. Let me see, when n=1, the sum is just 1. And 1 squared is also 1. So, 1 equals 1, which means the base case holds true. That wasn't too bad.\n\nNow, onto the inductive step. This is where I assume that the statement is true for some arbitrary positive integer k, and then I have to show that it must also be true for k+1. So, let me assume that the sum of the first k positive odd integers is k squared. In other words, 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k-1) = k\u00b2.\n\nOkay, now I need to show that the sum up to k+1 is (k+1) squared. The sum up to k+1 would be the sum up to k plus the next odd integer, which is (2(k+1)-1) = 2k + 1. So, the new sum is k\u00b2 + (2k + 1). I need to simplify this expression and see if it equals (k+1) squared.\n\nLet me compute (k+1) squared. That's k\u00b2 + 2k + 1. Wait a minute, that's exactly the same as k\u00b2 + 2k + 1, which is the same as the sum we just wrote: k\u00b2 + (2k + 1). So, that means the sum up to k+1 is indeed (k+1) squared. \n\nHmm, so that seems to work out. Therefore, by mathematical induction, the statement holds for all positive integers n. \n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, let me test it with another example. Let's take n=2. The sum of the first 2 odd integers is 1 + 3 = 4, which is 2 squared. For n=3, it's 1 + 3 + 5 = 9, which is 3 squared. Yeah, that checks out. \n\nI think I've got it. The inductive step worked out because adding the next odd integer increased the sum in a way that perfectly squares it again. So, the proof by induction holds.\n</think>\n\nTo prove by mathematical induction that the sum of the first \\( n \\) positive odd integers equals \\( n^2 \\), we proceed as follows:\n\n**Base Case (\\( n = 1 \\)):**\nThe sum of the first 1 positive odd integer is \\( 1 \\). \n\\[ 1 = 1^2 \\]\nThus, the base case holds.\n\n**Inductive Step:**\nAssume that the statement is true for some arbitrary positive integer \\( k \\), i.e.,\n\\[ 1 + 3 + 5 + \\dots + (2k - 1) = k^2 \\]\n\nWe need to show that the statement holds for \\( k + 1 \\), that is:\n\\[ 1 + 3 + 5 + \\dots + (2k - 1) + (2(k + 1) - 1) = (k + 1)^2 \\]\n\nStarting with the left-hand side for \\( k + 1 \\):\n\\[ 1 + 3 + 5 + \\dots + (2k - 1) + (2k + 1) \\]\nBy the induction hypothesis:\n\\[ k^2 + (2k + 1) \\]\nSimplify:\n\\[ k^2 + 2k + 1 = (k + 1)^2 \\]\nThus, the statement holds for \\( k + 1 \\).\n\nBy the principle of mathematical induction, the sum of the first \\( n \\) positive odd integers is \\( n^2 \\) for all positive integers \\( n \\).\n\nDONE."

Hmm, induction, right? I remember that involves two steps: the base case and the inductive step. Let me try to recall how that works.\n\nFirst, the base case. That should be when n is 1, right? So when n=1, the sum is just 1. And 1 squared is also 1. So, yeah, the base case holds because 1 equals 1. That makes sense.\n\nNow, for the inductive step. I think I need to assume that the statement is true for some arbitrary positive integer k. So, let's say that 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k - 1) equals k squared. That's my induction hypothesis.\n\nNext, I need to show that if the statement holds for n=k, then it must also hold for n=k+1. So, I have to consider the sum up to k+1. That would be 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k - 1) + (2(k+1) - 1). Simplifying that last term, 2(k+1) - 1 is 2k + 2 - 1, which is 2k + 1. So, the sum up to k+1 is the sum up to k plus (2k + 1).\n\nAccording to my induction hypothesis, the sum up to k is k squared. So, substituting that in, the sum up to k+1 would be k squared plus (2k + 1). Let me write that down: k\u00b2 + (2k + 1). Hmm, can I simplify that?\n\nYes, combining like terms. Let's see, k squared plus 2k plus 1. Wait, that looks familiar. Isn't that the expansion of (k + 1) squared? Let me check: (k + 1)\u00b2 = k\u00b2 + 2k + 1. Exactly! So, the sum up to k+1 is (k + 1) squared.\n\nSince both the base case and the inductive step have been proven, by mathematical induction, the sum of the first n positive odd integers is n squared for all positive integers n. I think that covers it.\n\nWait, did I miss anything? Let me go through it again. Base case: n=1, 1=1\u00b2, correct. Inductive step: assume sum up to k is k\u00b2, then sum up to k+1 is k\u00b2 + (2k+1) = (k+1)\u00b2. Yeah, that seems solid. I can't think of any mistakes there.

Hmm, let's see. I remember that mathematical induction has two main steps: the base case and the inductive step. The base case is usually n=1, and then I have to assume it's true for some k and then prove it for k+1.\n\nAlright, let's start with the base case. When n=1, the sum is just 1. And 1 squared is also 1. So, 1=1, which checks out. That seems straightforward.\n\nNow, moving on to the inductive step. Let's assume that for some integer k, the sum of the first k positive odd integers is k squared. In other words, 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k-1) = k\u00b2. Okay, so that's my induction hypothesis.\n\nNow, I need to show that if this is true for k, then it must also be true for k+1. That means, I have to find the sum up to (2k+1) and show that it's equal to (k+1) squared. So, the sum up to k+1 would be the sum up to k plus the next odd number, which is 2k+1.\n\nSo, writing that out: Sum up to k+1 is [1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k-1)] + (2k+1). According to my induction hypothesis, the first part is k\u00b2. So, the sum becomes k\u00b2 + (2k+1).\n\nNow, I need to simplify that expression. Let's see, k\u00b2 + 2k + 1. Hmm, that looks familiar. Oh, wait, that's the expansion of (k+1) squared because (k+1)\u00b2 = k\u00b2 + 2k + 1. So, the sum up to k+1 is (k+1)\u00b2, which is exactly what we wanted to prove.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. If I take k=2, for example, the sum should be 1 + 3 = 4, which is 2 squared. And according to the inductive step, when k=2, the sum up to k is 4, and adding the next odd number, which is 5, gives 4 + 5 = 9, which is 3 squared. Yep, that works.\n\nSimilarly, for k=3, the sum is 1 + 3 + 5 = 9, which is 3 squared. Adding the next odd number, 7, gives 16, which is 4 squared. So, it seems to hold.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the inductive step holds because adding the next odd number to k squared gives the next square number. Therefore, by mathematical induction, the sum of the first n positive odd integers is n squared for all positive integers n.\n</think>\n\nThe sum of the first \\( n \\) positive odd integers is \\( n^2 \\).\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation and Proof:**\n\n1. **Base Case (\\( n = 1 \\)):**\n   - The sum of the first 1 positive odd integer is \\( 1 \\).\n   - \\( 1^2 = 1 \\).\n   - Thus, the base case holds.\n\n2. **Inductive Hypothesis:**\n   - Assume that for some positive integer \\( k \\), the sum of the first \\( k \\) positive odd integers is \\( k^2 \\).

The base case is usually n=1, and then I assume it's true for some arbitrary positive integer k, and then prove it's true for k+1. If both steps work, then the statement is true for all positive integers.\n\nStarting with the base case, n=1. Let me check if the sum of the first 1 odd integer equals 1 squared.\n\nSo, 1 = 1\u00b2, which is 1=1. That checks out. So the base case is true.\n\nNow, for the inductive step. I need to assume that the statement is true for some arbitrary positive integer k. That is, assume that 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k - 1) = k\u00b2. This is my inductive hypothesis.\n\nNow, I need to show that the statement holds for k+1. That is, the sum of the first k+1 odd integers equals (k+1) squared. So, that sum would be 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k - 1) + (2(k+1) - 1). Simplifying that last term, 2(k+1) -1 is 2k +2 -1, which is 2k +1.\n\nSo, the sum becomes 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k -1) + (2k +1). Now, according to my inductive hypothesis, the sum up to 2k -1 is k\u00b2. So, substituting that in, the sum is k\u00b2 + (2k +1).\n\nSo, I need to show that k\u00b2 + 2k +1 equals (k +1)\u00b2.

Let's assume that the formula holds for some arbitrary positive integer k. That means we're assuming that 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k - 1) = k\u00b2.

In other words, we need to prove that 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k - 1) + (2(k + 1) - 1) = (k + 1)\u00b2.\n\nWait, let me make sure I have that right. The sum up to k is k\u00b2, so adding the next odd number, which would be 2(k + 1) - 1. Let me compute that: 2(k + 1) - 1 = 2k + 2 - 1 = 2k + 1. So, the next term is 2k + 1.\n\nSo, the sum up to k + 1 would be the sum up to k plus 2k + 1. According to our inductive hypothesis, the sum up to k is k\u00b2. Therefore, the sum up to k + 1 is k\u00b2 + 2k + 1.\n\nHmm, can I simplify that? Let's see: k\u00b2 + 2k + 1. Oh, that looks familiar. That's a perfect square. Specifically, it's (k + 1)\u00b2 because (k + 1)\u00b2 = k\u00b2 + 2k + 1. Perfect!\n\nSo, that means the sum up to k + 1 is indeed (k + 1)\u00b2, which is exactly what we needed to show. Therefore, by mathematical induction, the formula holds for all positive integers n.\n\nWait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Yep, that seems correct.\n\nI think I got it. So, the inductive step works because adding the next odd integer increases the sum in such a way that it forms a perfect square. That's pretty neat. It shows how the sum of consecutive odd numbers relates directly to the square of their count.\n\nJust to summarize: the base case holds for n = 1, and assuming it holds for n = k, we've shown it must also hold for n = k + 1.

That is, prove that 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2n-1) = n\u00b2 for all positive integers n. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I need to prove by mathematical induction that the sum of the first n positive odd integers equals n squared. Hmm, okay, let me recall what mathematical induction involves. From what I remember, it's a two-step process: the base case and the inductive step. \n\nFirst, the base case. That means I need to check if the statement is true for n=1. So, the sum of the first 1 positive odd integer. Well, the first odd integer is 1, right? So, 1 equals 1 squared, which is 1. Okay, that works. So, the base case holds.\n\nNow, the inductive step. This is where I assume that the statement is true for some arbitrary positive integer k, and then I need to show that it's also true for k+1. So, let's assume that the sum of the first k positive odd integers is k squared. That is, 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k-1) = k\u00b2. \n\nNow, I need to show that the sum up to k+1 odd integers is (k+1) squared. So, that would be 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k-1) + (2(k+1)-1). Wait, what's 2(k+1)-1? Let me compute that. 2k + 2 -1 is 2k +1. So, the next odd integer after 2k-1 is 2k+1.\n\nSo, the sum up to k+1 terms would be the sum up to k terms plus (2k+1). From my inductive hypothesis, the sum up to k terms is k squared. So, the new sum is k\u00b2 + (2k +1). Let me write that down: k\u00b2 + 2k +1. Hmm, that looks familiar. Isn't that the expansion of (k +1) squared? Because (k +1) squared is k\u00b2 + 2k +1. Exactly!\n\nSo, the sum up to k+1 terms is (k +1) squared, which is what we needed to show. Therefore, by mathematical induction, the statement holds for all positive integers n.\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Base case: n=1, sum is 1, which is 1\u00b2. Correct. Inductive step: Assume it's true for n=k, so sum is k\u00b2. Then for n=k+1, sum is k\u00b2 + (2k+1) = k\u00b2 +2k +1 = (k+1)\u00b2. That seems right. Yeah, I think that works.\n</think>\n\nTo prove that the sum of the first \\( n \\) positive odd integers equals \\( n^2 \\) for all positive integers \\( n \\), we use mathematical induction.\n\n**Base Case:**\nFor \\( n = 1 \\), the sum is \\( 1 \\), which equals \\( 1^2 \\).

That is, prove that 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2n-1) = n\u00b2 for all positive integers n. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this problem to prove by mathematical induction that the sum of the first n positive odd integers equals n squared. That is, I need to show that 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2n - 1) = n\u00b2 for all positive integers n. Hmm, okay, induction seems like the way to go here. I remember that mathematical induction involves two main steps: the base case and the inductive step. \n\nLet me start with the base case because that's usually straightforward. So, for n = 1, the sum should be just 1. Plugging into the formula, 1 squared is also 1. So, 1 = 1, which checks out. That means the base case works. Good, that's the easy part done.\n\nNow, moving on to the inductive step. This is where I assume that the statement is true for some arbitrary positive integer k, and then I have to prove that it must also be true for k + 1. So, let me assume that 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k - 1) = k\u00b2. That's my induction hypothesis.\n\nNext, I need to show that 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k - 1) + (2(k + 1) - 1) = (k + 1)\u00b2. Let me write that out. So, the sum up to k terms is k\u00b2, and if I add the next odd number, which is 2(k + 1) - 1, that should give me (k + 1)\u00b2.\n\nWait, let me compute that next term: 2(k + 1) - 1 = 2k + 2 - 1 = 2k + 1. So, the next term is 2k + 1. Therefore, the sum up to k + 1 terms is k\u00b2 + (2k + 1). I need to show that this equals (k + 1)\u00b2.\n\nLet me compute (k + 1)\u00b2: that's k\u00b2 + 2k + 1. Hmm, interesting! So, k\u00b2 + (2k + 1) is exactly equal to (k + 1)\u00b2. Therefore, the sum up to k + 1 terms is (k + 1)\u00b2, which is what I needed to prove.\n\nWait a second, that seems too straightforward. Did I miss something? Let me double-check. So, assuming it's true for k, I add the next odd number, which is 2k + 1, and that's the same as (k + 1)\u00b2 minus k\u00b2, which is 2k + 1. Yep, that makes sense. So, the inductive step holds.\n\nBut, just to be thorough, maybe I should try an example with a specific number to make sure this works. Let's take k = 2. According to the formula, the sum should be 2\u00b2 = 4. Let's compute the sum: 1 + 3 = 4. That's correct. Now, let's check k = 3. The sum should be 3\u00b2 = 9. Calculating: 1 + 3 + 5 = 9. That's also correct. Maybe k = 4: 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16, which is 4\u00b2. Perfect, it works.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the base case holds, and the inductive step also works. Therefore, by mathematical induction, the sum of the first n positive odd integers is equal to n\u00b2 for all positive integers n. I think that covers it.\n\nWait, hold on. Just to ensure I haven't overlooked anything, let me think about the structure of the induction proof again. Sometimes, people make mistakes in setting up the inductive step. Let me make sure I correctly applied the formula. So, starting from the sum up to k, which is k\u00b2, and adding the (k + 1)th odd number, which is 2k + 1, resulting in k\u00b2 + 2k + 1, which factors into (k + 1)\u00b2. That seems correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to visualize the sum. The first n odd numbers: 1, 3, 5, ..., (2n - 1). If I pair them up, maybe I can see a pattern. But actually, pairing might not be necessary here since induction suffices.\n\nAlternatively, I remember that Gauss once added the first n odd numbers and noticed that the sum was a perfect square. This problem is similar to that. So, maybe there's another way to see it, but for the purposes of this proof, induction is the way to go.\n\nI think I'm confident that the proof is solid. Base case works, inductive step holds, and examples check out. So, I can conclude that the statement is true for all positive integers n.\n</think>\n\nTo prove by mathematical induction that for all positive integers \\( n \\), the sum of the first \\( n \\) positive odd integers equals \\( n^2 \\), we proceed as follows:\n\n**Base Case (\\( n = 1 \\))**:\nThe sum of the first 1 positive odd integer is \\( 1 \\). According to the formula, \\( 1^2 = 1 \\). Thus, the base case holds.\n\n**Inductive Step**:\nAssume that for some arbitrary positive integer \\( k \\), the sum of the first \\( k \\) positive odd integers is \\( k^2 \\). That is,\n\\[\n1 + 3 + 5 + \\dots + (2k - 1) = k^2\n\\]\nWe need to show that the sum of the first \\( k + 1 \\) positive odd integers is \\( (k + 1)^2 \\). \n\nConsider adding the next odd integer, which is \\( 2(k + 1) - 1 = 2k + 1 \\), to both sides of the induction hypothesis:\n\\[\n1 + 3 + 5 + \\dots + (2k - 1) + (2k + 1) = k^2 + (2k + 1)\n\\]\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\\[\nk^2 + 2k + 1 = (k + 1)^2\n\\]\nThus, the sum of the first \\( k + 1 \\) positive odd integers is \\( (k + 1)^2 \\).\n\nBy the principle of mathematical induction, the statement holds for all positive integers \\( n \\). Therefore, the sum of the first \\( n \\) positive odd integers is \\( n^2 \\).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe sum of the first \\( n \\) positive odd integers is indeed \\( n^2 \\) for all positive integers \\( n \\).

Hmm, okay, induction is a method where I prove the base case and then show that if it holds for some integer k, it holds for k+1. Let me start by recalling the formula for the sum of the first n odd integers. I think it's 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2n-1), right? And the claim is that this sum equals n\u00b2. Cool.\n\nFirst, I need to check the base case, which is usually n=1. Let's see, when n=1, the sum is just 1. And 1 squared is 1. So, 1=1, which is true. Okay, base case is verified.\n\nNext, I need to assume that the formula holds for some arbitrary positive integer k. That is, assume that 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k-1) = k\u00b2. This is my induction hypothesis.\n\nNow, I have to show that if the formula holds for k, it also holds for k+1. That means I need to show that the sum up to the (k+1)th odd integer is equal to (k+1) squared. So, the sum up to (k+1) would be 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k-1) + (2(k+1)-1). Simplifying that last term, 2(k+1)-1 is 2k + 2 -1, which is 2k+1.\n\nSo, the sum becomes [1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k-1)] + (2k+1). According to my induction hypothesis, the first part is k\u00b2. So, substituting that in, the sum is k\u00b2 + (2k+1).\n\nNow, I need to see if k\u00b2 + (2k+1) equals (k+1)\u00b2. Let me compute (k+1)\u00b2: that's k\u00b2 + 2k + 1. Wait, that's exactly what I have! So, k\u00b2 + 2k + 1 is indeed equal to (k+1)\u00b2. Therefore, the sum up to (k+1) terms is (k+1)\u00b2, which means the formula holds for k+1.\n\nSince both the base case and the induction step have been proven, by mathematical induction, the sum of the first n positive odd integers is equal to n\u00b2 for all positive integers n. I think that covers it. I didn't see any mistakes in my reasoning, but let me double-check quickly. Base case works, assumed k works, then k+1 follows from adding the next odd number and expanding the square. Yeah, that makes sense.\n</think>\n\nAlright, let's go through the proof step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Base Case**\n\nFirst, we verify the statement for \\( n = 1 \\).\n\nThe sum of the first 1 positive odd integer is:\n\\[ 1 \\]\n\nWe need to check if this equals \\( 1^2 \\):\n\\[ 1 = 1 \\]\nWhich is true.\n\n**Step 2: Induction Hypothesis**\n\nAssume that the statement is true for some arbitrary positive integer \\( k \\).

The base case is usually proving that the statement holds for n=1, and then the inductive step assumes it holds for some arbitrary n=k and proves it for n=k+1.\n\nLet me start with the base case.

This is my inductive hypothesis.\n\nNext, I need to show that if this assumption is true, then the statement must also be true for n=k+1. That means, I have to show that 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k-1) + (2(k+1)-1) = (k+1)\u00b2.\n\nWait, (2(k+1)-1) simplifies to 2k + 2 - 1, which is 2k +1. So, the sum up to n=k+1 is the sum up to n=k plus (2k+1). According to my inductive hypothesis, the sum up to n=k is k\u00b2.
