  "answer": "To prove that 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2n-1) = n\u00b2 for all positive integers n, I'll use mathematical induction.\n\nStep 1: Base Case\nFor n = 1, we need to verify that the formula holds.\nLeft side: The first odd integer is 1, so the sum is just 1.\nRight side: 1\u00b2 = 1\nSince 1 = 1, the base case is true.\n\nStep 2: Induction Hypothesis\nAssume that the statement is true for some positive integer k. That is, assume:\n1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k-1) = k\u00b2\n\nStep 3: Induction Step\nWe need to prove that the statement is true for n = k+1. That is, we need to show:\n1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k-1) + (2(k+1)-1) = (k+1)\u00b2\n\nStarting with the left side:\n1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k-1) + (2(k+1)-1) = 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k-1) + (2k+1)\n\nBy the induction hypothesis, we know that 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k-1) = k\u00b2\nSo we can substitute:\n1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k-1) + (2k+1) = k\u00b2 + (2k+1)\n\nNow we need to simplify the right side of what we want to prove:\n(k+1)\u00b2 = k\u00b2 + 2k + 1\n\nComparing our results:\nk\u00b2 + (2k+1) = k\u00b2 + 2k + 1\n\nThis is indeed true, confirming that if the statement holds for n = k, it also holds for n = k+1.\n\nStep 4: Conclusion\nBy the principle of mathematical induction, since we've shown the base case is true and the induction step works, the statement 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2n-1) = n\u00b2 is true for all positive integers n."
