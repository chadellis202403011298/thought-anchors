Each face of each cube is painted either red, blue, or yellow, with exactly two faces of each color on each cube. The cubes are placed in a row on a table. Looking at the cubes from the front, you see the colors [red, blue, yellow] from left to right. Looking at the cubes from the right side, you see the colors [yellow, red, blue] from front to back. What colors would you see when looking at the cubes from the top, reading from left to right? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I've got this cube problem here, and I need to figure out what colors I'll see when looking at the cubes from the top, reading left to right. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. There are three identical cubes. Each cube has six faces, and each face is painted either red, blue, or yellow. Importantly, each color appears exactly two times on each cube. So, for each cube, there are two red faces, two blue faces, and two yellow faces.\n\nThe cubes are placed in a row on a table. When looking at them from the front, the colors I see are red, blue, yellow from left to right. So, the front face of the first cube is red, the front face of the second cube is blue, and the front face of the third cube is yellow.\n\nAdditionally, when looking at the cubes from the right side, I see the colors yellow, red, blue from front to back. That means, if I look at the rightmost cube (the third cube) from the right side, the front face is yellow, the back face is red, and the right face is blue. Wait, hold on, that might not be quite right. Let me think about this.\n\nWhen looking at the cubes from the right, I see the right faces of each cube from front to back. So, the right face of the first cube (frontmost) is yellow, the right face of the second cube is red, and the right face of the third cube is blue. That makes more sense. So, from the right, it's yellow (first cube), red (second), blue (third).\n\nNow, the question is: what colors will I see when looking at the cubes from the top, reading from left to right?\n\nTo solve this, I think I need to figure out the orientation of each cube. Since each cube is identical and has the same color distribution, their orientations relative to each other might affect the top view.\n\nLet me start by considering the front view. The first cube has a red front face. The second cube has a blue front face, and the third has a yellow front face. So, each cube's front face is visible from the front, and their right faces are visible from the right.\n\nSince each cube has two faces of each color, the remaining four faces (excluding the front and right) must consist of the other colors, but I need to figure out how they are arranged.\n\nLet me visualize each cube:\n\nCube 1 (front: red, right: yellow)\nCube 2 (front: blue, right: red)\nCube 3 (front: yellow, right: blue)\n\nWait, no, from the right, we see yellow (first cube), red (second), blue (third). So:\n\nCube 1: Right face = yellow\nCube 2: Right face = red\nCube 3: Right face = blue\n\nSo, each cube's right face is known.\n\nNow, each cube has exactly two faces of each color. So, for each cube, the front and right faces are known, and the other four faces must consist of the remaining colors.\n\nLet me denote the top, bottom, left, and back faces for each cube.\n\nFor Cube 1:\n\nFront: red\nRight: yellow\nSo, remaining colors: blue and yellow have two each, but wait, no, each cube has exactly two of each color. Since front is red, right is yellow, the remaining colors (blue and yellow) must each have one more face, but wait, no, each color has exactly two faces. So, since front is red (one red face), and right is yellow (one yellow face), the other four faces must include one red, one blue, and one yellow? Wait, no, that can't be because each color must have exactly two faces on each cube.\n\nWait, correction: Each cube has exactly two faces of each color. So, for Cube 1, front is red (one red face), right is yellow (one yellow face). Therefore, the remaining four faces must include one more red, one more blue, and one more yellow? Wait, that doesn't add up because 1 (front red) + 1 (right yellow) + remaining four = total six faces. Each color must have two faces. So, for Cube 1:\n\nRed: front (1) + one more\nBlue: two faces\nYellow: right (1) + one more\n\nSo, the remaining four faces for Cube 1 must include one red, one blue, and one yellow, but that's only three faces. Wait, that's a problem. Hmm.\n\nWait, no, each color must have exactly two faces on each cube. So, if front is red (1), right is yellow (1), then the remaining four faces must consist of one red, two blue, and one yellow. That adds up to six faces: 1+2+1=4, but wait, no, 1 (front) + 1 (right) + 4 remaining = 6. So, the remaining four must include one red, two blue, and one yellow? That would total red: 2, blue: 2, yellow: 2. Yes, that works.\n\nSo, for Cube 1:\n\nFront: red\nRight: yellow\nRemaining: one red, two blue, one yellow.\n\nSimilarly, Cube 2:\n\nFront: blue\nRight: red\n\nSo, front is blue (1), right is red (1). Remaining four faces: one blue, two yellow, one red.\n\nCube 3:\n\nFront: yellow\nRight: blue\n\nFront is yellow (1), right is blue (1). Remaining four faces: one yellow, two red, one blue.\n\nWait, but each cube must have exactly two of each color, so Cube 1: red (front + one more), blue (two), yellow (right + one more). So, yes, that works.\n\nNow, to figure out the orientations, we need to determine which faces are top, bottom, left, and back for each cube.\n\nLet's start with Cube 1.\n\nCube 1:\n\nFront: red\nRight: yellow\nRemaining: one red, two blue, one yellow.\n\nWe need to assign the remaining colors to top, bottom, left, and back.\n\nBut we don't know the orientation yet, so we need to figure out where the top, bottom, left, and back faces are.\n\nSimilarly for Cube 2 and Cube 3.\n\nSince the cubes are placed in a row, their left and right faces are fixed relative to each other.\n\nWait, but from the front, the first cube's right face is yellow, and the second cube's right face is red, which is the front face of the second cube. Wait, no, the second cube's front face is blue, and its right face is red.\n\nWait, let's clarify the orientation.\n\nEach cube has a front, back, left, right, top, and bottom.\n\nWhen placed in a row, the left cube's right face is adjacent to the second cube's left face.\n\nSo, the right face of Cube 1 is the left face of Cube 2.\n\nBut from the right view, we see the right faces of each cube from front to back, which are yellow (Cube 1), red (Cube 2), blue (Cube 3).\n\nSo, the right face of Cube 1 is yellow, which is adjacent to the left face of Cube 2, which is red.\n\nSimilarly, the right face of Cube 2 is red, which is adjacent to the left face of Cube 3, which is blue.\n\nSo, the right face of Cube 1 is yellow, Cube 2's right face is red, and Cube 3's right face is blue.\n\nNow, considering the front view: Cube 1's front is red, Cube 2's front is blue, Cube 3's front is yellow.\n\nSo, let's try to assign the remaining faces for each cube.\n\nStarting with Cube 1:\n\nFront: red\nRight: yellow\nRemaining: one red, two blue, one yellow.\n\nWe need to assign top, bottom, left, back.\n\nBut we also know that the left face of Cube 1 is adjacent to the right face of Cube 0 (which doesn't exist), so the left face of Cube 1 is just the left face. Similarly, the right face of Cube 1 is yellow, which is adjacent to the left face of Cube 2, which is red.\n\nSo, the right face of Cube 1 is yellow, which is connected to the left face of Cube 2, which is red.\n\nSo, the right face of Cube 1 is yellow, and the left face of Cube 2 is red.\n\nNow, for Cube 1, the remaining faces are top, bottom, left, back.\n\nWe have one red, two blue, and one yellow to assign.\n\nBut we need to figure out where these go.\n\nSimilarly for Cube 2:\n\nFront: blue\nRight: red\nRemaining: one blue, two yellow, one red.\n\nAnd Cube 3:\n\nFront: yellow\nRight: blue\nRemaining: one yellow, two red, one blue.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I can try to figure out the orientations based on the right view.\n\nFrom the right view, the right faces are yellow, red, blue.\n\nSo, for Cube 1, right face is yellow.\n\nFor Cube 2, right face is red.\n\nFor Cube 3, right face is blue.\n\nNow, let's try to figure out the top view.\n\nFrom the top, we'll see the top faces of each cube, from left to right.\n\nSo, the top face of Cube 1, then Cube 2, then Cube 3.\n\nBut to know the top faces, we need to know their orientations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can figure out the top faces based on the front and right views.\n\nWait, perhaps using the fact that opposite faces are the same color.\n\nBut no, in this case, each color has exactly two faces, so opposite faces can't both be the same color unless they are on opposite sides.\n\nWait, but each cube has two faces of each color. So, for each cube, each color is on two opposite faces or adjacent faces.\n\nBut since each cube is identical, the arrangement could be either way.\n\nWait, but in this case, since each cube has two faces of each color, and we know the front and right faces, we can figure out the opposite faces.\n\nWait, for Cube 1:\n\nFront: red\nRight: yellow\nSo, the back face must be opposite to front, which is red, so back face is also red? But wait, each color has exactly two faces, so front and back can both be red.\n\nWait, but if front is red, back must be red as well, because they are opposite.\n\nSimilarly, right is yellow, so the left face must be yellow.\n\nWait, but from the right view, the right face of Cube 1 is yellow, which is adjacent to the left face of Cube 2, which is red.\n\nSo, Cube 1's right face is yellow, and Cube 2's left face is red.\n\nTherefore, Cube 1's left face is yellow.\n\nWait, no, Cube 1's left face is adjacent to nothing (since it's the first cube), so it's just the left face.\n\nSimilarly, Cube 2's left face is red, which is adjacent to Cube 1's right face, which is yellow.\n\nSo, Cube 1's right face is yellow, Cube 2's left face is red.\n\nTherefore, for Cube 1:\n\nFront: red\nRight: yellow\nLeft: ?\n\nSince Cube 1's left face is adjacent to nothing, it can be any color, but we have to figure out based on the remaining colors.\n\nWait, but each cube has exactly two of each color, so Cube 1 has two reds, two blues, two yellows.\n\nFront: red\nRight: yellow\nSo, remaining: one red, two blue, one yellow.\n\nBut Cube 1's left face is part of these.\n\nWait, but Cube 1's left face is a single face, so it can only be one color.\n\nSimilarly, the back face is opposite to front, so it's red.\n\nSo, back face: red.\n\nTherefore, for Cube 1:\n\nFront: red\nBack: red\nRight: yellow\nLeft: ?\n\nRemaining colors: blue and yellow.\n\nBut we have two blue faces and one yellow face left.\n\nWait, no, Cube 1 has two blue faces and one yellow face remaining (since front is red, right is yellow, back is red).\n\nWait, no, let's recount:\n\nCube 1:\n\nTotal: 6 faces\n\nFront: red (1)\nRight: yellow (1)\nBack: red (1) [opposite to front]\nLeft: ?\n\nRemaining: 6 - 3 = 3 faces.\n\nBut we have two blue and two yellow faces on each cube.\n\nWait, no, each cube has exactly two of each color.\n\nSo, Cube 1:\n\nRed: front and back (2)\nBlue: two faces (left and top or something)\nYellow: right and one more.\n\nWait, that's better.\n\nSo, Cube 1:\n\nFront: red\nBack: red\nRight: yellow\nLeft: ?\nTop: ?\nBottom: ?\n\nBut each color has exactly two faces.\n\nSo, for Cube 1:\n\nRed: front and back (2)\nYellow: right and one more\nBlue: two faces, which must be left and top or left and bottom, etc.\n\nWait, but we don't know the orientation yet.\n\nSimilarly, Cube 2:\n\nFront: blue\nBack: blue\nRight: red\nLeft: ?\nTop: ?\nBottom: ?\n\nCube 3:\n\nFront: yellow\nBack: yellow\nRight: blue\nLeft: ?\nTop: ?\nBottom: ?\n\nThis seems more manageable.\n\nSo, for Cube 1:\n\nFront: red\nBack: red\nRight: yellow\nLeft: ?\n\nSince the right face is yellow, the left face is adjacent to it, but since it's the first cube, the left face can be any color.\n\nBut we know that Cube 1 has two blue faces and two yellow faces.\n\nSince front and back are red, the remaining four faces (left, right, top, bottom) must consist of two blue and two yellow.\n\nWait, no, Cube 1 has:\n\nRed: front and back (2)\nYellow: right and one more (since right is yellow)\nBlue: two faces.\n\nSo, the remaining faces for Cube 1 are left, top, bottom, and one more yellow.\n\nWait, no, Cube 1 has:\n\nFront: red\nBack: red\nRight: yellow\nLeft: ?\nTop: ?\nBottom: ?\nRemaining colors: blue and yellow.\n\nWe need to assign two blue faces and one yellow face to left, top, bottom.\n\nWait, that can't be because each color must have exactly two faces.\n\nWait, I think I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me try a different approach.\n\nEach cube has exactly two of each color.\n\nSo, for Cube 1:\n\nFront: red\nBack: red (since opposite to front)\nRight: yellow\nLeft: ?\n\nSo, the left face must be another color.\n\nSince Cube 1 has two reds, two blues, and two yellows.\n\nFront and back: red (2)\nRight: yellow (1)\nSo, left face must be yellow (1), and the remaining top and bottom must be blue (2).\n\nTherefore, for Cube 1:\n\nFront: red\nBack: red\nRight: yellow\nLeft: yellow\nTop: blue\nBottom: blue\n\nSimilarly, Cube 2:\n\nFront: blue\nBack: blue\nRight: red\nLeft: ?\n\nCube 2 has two blues, two reds, and two yellows.\n\nFront: blue\nBack: blue\nRight: red\nLeft: ?\n\nLeft face must be another color. Since right face is red, left face can be any color.\n\nBut Cube 2 has two reds, so right is red, so left must be another color.\n\nWait, no, Cube 2 has front: blue, back: blue, right: red.\n\nSo, remaining colors: yellow.\n\nBut Cube 2 has two yellows, so the left face must be yellow, and the top and bottom must be the remaining color.\n\nWait, no, let's recount.\n\nCube 2:\n\nFront: blue\nBack: blue\nRight: red\nLeft: ?\n\nTotal colors: two blues, two reds, two yellows.\n\nUsed so far:\n\nFront: blue (1)\nBack: blue (1)\nRight: red (1)\nLeft: ?\n\nSo, remaining colors:\n\nBlue: 1 left\nRed: 1 left\nYellow: 2 left\n\nWait, that can't be right because each color must have exactly two.\n\nWait, Cube 2:\n\nFront: blue (1)\nBack: blue (1)\nRight: red (1)\nLeft: ?\n\nSo, remaining colors:\n\nBlue: 0 (since front and back are both blue)\nRed: 1 left\nYellow: 2 left\n\nWait, that can't be because each cube must have exactly two of each color.\n\nWait, I think I'm making a mistake here.\n\nEach cube has exactly two of each color, so Cube 2:\n\nFront: blue (1)\nBack: blue (1)\nRight: red (1)\nLeft: red (1) because it must have two reds.\n\nWait, but then left face is red.\n\nThen, the remaining top and bottom must be yellow.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, Cube 2:\n\nFront: blue\nBack: blue\nRight: red\nLeft: red\nTop: yellow\nBottom: yellow\n\nSimilarly, Cube 3:\n\nFront: yellow\nBack: yellow\nRight: blue\nLeft: ?\n\nCube 3 has two yellows, two blues, and two reds.\n\nFront: yellow (1)\nBack: yellow (1)\nRight: blue (1)\nLeft: ?\n\nSo, remaining colors:\n\nBlue: 1 left\nRed: 2 left\nYellow: 0 left\n\nWait, that can't be right.\n\nWait, no, Cube 3:\n\nFront: yellow\nBack: yellow\nRight: blue\nLeft: ?\n\nSo, front and back: yellow (2)\nRight: blue (1)\nLeft: ?\n\nRemaining colors:\n\nBlue: 1 left\nRed: 2 left\n\nBut each cube must have exactly two of each color.\n\nSo, Cube 3:\n\nFront: yellow\nBack: yellow\nRight: blue\nLeft: blue (to make two blues)\nTop: red\nBottom: red\n\nYes, that works.\n\nSo, now we have the orientations of each cube.\n\nCube 1:\n\nFront: red\nBack: red\nRight: yellow\nLeft: yellow\nTop: blue\nBottom: blue\n\nCube 2:\n\nFront: blue\nBack: blue\nRight: red\nLeft: red\nTop: yellow\nBottom: yellow\n\nCube 3:\n\nFront: yellow\nBack: yellow\nRight: blue\nLeft: blue\nTop: red\nBottom: red\n\nNow, when looking at the cubes from the top, reading left to right, we'll see the top faces of each cube.\n\nSo, Cube 1's top face is blue.\n\nCube 2's top face is yellow.\n\nCube 3's top face is red.\n\nTherefore, the top view from left to right is blue, yellow, red.\n\nWait, but let me double-check.\n\nCube"

    "solution": "Solve this problem step by step. End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: You have three identical cubes. Each face of each cube is painted either red, blue, or yellow, with exactly two faces of each color on each cube. The cubes are placed in a row on a table. Looking at the cubes from the front, you see the colors [red, blue, yellow] from left to right. Looking at the cubes from the right side, you see the colors [yellow, red, blue] from front to back. What colors would you see when looking at the cubes from the top, reading from left to right? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I've got this problem here about three identical cubes, each painted with exactly two faces of red, two of blue, and two of yellow. The cubes are placed in a row on a table. From the front view, the colors I see are red, blue, yellow from left to right. From the right side, looking at them front to back, the colors are yellow, red, blue. I need to figure out what colors I would see from the top, reading left to right.\n\nFirst, I need to visualize the setup. There are three cubes in a row. Let's label them Cube 1, Cube 2, and Cube 3 from left to right. When viewed from the front, Cube 1 shows red on the front face, Cube 2 shows blue, and Cube 3 shows yellow. So, each cube has its front face visible, and the other faces are hidden.\n\nNow, looking at them from the right side, the colors are yellow, red, blue. That means if I look at Cube 3 from the right, I see yellow. But wait, Cube 3 was already showing yellow from the front. Hmm, that might mean that the right face of Cube 3 is also yellow. But each cube only has two faces of each color, so if the front is yellow, the right face could also be yellow, but that would leave only one yellow face for the top and back, but each cube has two of each color. Wait, no, each cube has exactly two faces of each color, so if front is yellow, then another face is yellow, but which one?\n\nWait, maybe I need to think about the orientation of each cube. Each cube is identical, so their shapes are the same. Each cube has six faces: front, back, left, right, top, bottom. Each color is on exactly two faces. So for each cube, two red, two blue, and two yellow.\n\nFrom the front view, Cube 1 has red on the front. So front face of Cube 1 is red. Since each cube has two red faces, one is front, the other must be either top, bottom, left, or right.\n\nSimilarly, Cube 2 has blue on the front. So front face of Cube 2 is blue, and the other blue face is either top, bottom, left, or right.\n\nCube 3 has yellow on the front, so front face is yellow, and the other yellow face is on top, bottom, left, or right.\n\nNow, from the right side view, looking at the row from the right, the colors are yellow, red, blue. So for Cube 3, which is on the far right, when viewed from the right, it shows yellow. Since Cube 3's front is yellow, and now from the right, it's also yellow. That suggests that the right face of Cube 3 is yellow. Therefore, Cube 3 has front and right faces as yellow, which accounts for both of its yellow faces. So the top and bottom faces of Cube 3 must be the remaining colors, which are red and blue. But wait, each cube only has two faces of each color. Cube 3 has front and right as yellow, so top and bottom must be red and blue. But since each cube has two of each color, Cube 3's top and bottom are red and blue, but we don't know which is which yet.\n\nSimilarly, Cube 1 has front face red. From the right view, the rightmost cube (Cube 3) shows yellow from the front and yellow from the right. But when looking from the right, the colors are yellow, red, blue. So for Cube 1, which is on the far left when viewed from the right, it's the first cube in that view. So from the right, looking at Cube 1, it's showing red. Wait, that's confusing. Let me clarify.\n\nWhen looking from the right, the order is Cube 3, Cube 2, Cube 1. Because when you look from the right, the far right cube is Cube 3, then Cube 2, then Cube 1 on the far left. So from the right, Cube 3 is on the left side of the view, Cube 2 is in the middle, and Cube 1 is on the right side. So the colors from the right view are yellow (Cube 3's right face), red (Cube 2's right face), and blue (Cube 1's right face). Wait, no, the problem says \"Looking at the cubes from the right side, you see the colors [yellow, red, blue] from front to back.\" So front to back would mean starting from the front cube (Cube 1) to the back cube (Cube 3). But when viewed from the right, the front of the row is Cube 1, and the back is Cube 3. So from the right, looking at them front to back, the colors are yellow, red, blue. That means Cube 1's right face is yellow, Cube 2's right face is red, and Cube 3's right face is blue. Wait, that makes more sense.\n\nSo, from the right view:\n\n- Cube 1's right face is yellow.\n- Cube 2's right face is red.\n- Cube 3's right face is blue.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought Cube 3's right face was yellow because from the front it was yellow. But now, according to the right view, Cube 3's right face is blue. That changes things.\n\nSo let's correct that.\n\nFrom the front view:\n\n- Cube 1: front = red\n- Cube 2: front = blue\n- Cube 3: front = yellow\n\nFrom the right view:\n\n- Cube 1: right = yellow\n- Cube 2: right = red\n- Cube 3: right = blue\n\nSo each cube has two faces of each color. Let's go cube by cube.\n\nStarting with Cube 1.\n\nCube 1:\n\n- Front = red\n- Right = yellow\n\nSo Cube 1 has red and yellow on front and right. Therefore, the remaining faces (top, bottom, left) must be blue and... wait, Cube 1 has two blue faces as well. So since front is red, right is yellow, the other four faces (top, bottom, left, back) must include two blue and one red and one yellow? Wait, no. Each cube has exactly two faces of each color. So Cube 1 has two red, two blue, and two yellow. It already has front as red and right as yellow, so it needs one more red and two blues, but that would be three faces, which is impossible. Wait, no, each color has exactly two faces. So Cube 1 has front and one other face as red. It has right and one other face as yellow. And the remaining two faces must be blue.\n\nSo Cube 1:\n\n- Front: red\n- Right: yellow\n- Back: ?\n- Top: ?\n- Bottom: ?\n- Left: ?\n\nSince it has two reds, one is front, the other must be either back, top, bottom, or left.\n\nSimilarly, two yellows: front and right, so no more yellows.\n\nTwo blues: back, top, bottom, left. So two of these four faces must be blue.\n\nBut let's think about Cube 1's right face is yellow, so the left face is opposite to the right. But wait, in a cube, left and right are opposite faces. So if the right face is yellow, the left face is also yellow, but each cube can only have two yellow faces. Wait, that's a contradiction because if Cube 1's right face is yellow, the left face is also yellow, but that would mean two yellows on Cube 1, but Cube 1's front is red, so front and left are red and yellow? Wait, no, front is red, right is yellow, so left is opposite to right, so left is yellow as well, but that would mean two yellows on Cube 1: right and left. But each cube can only have two yellows. So that's fine. So Cube 1's left face is yellow, same as right.\n\nBut wait, from the front view, Cube 1's front is red, and from the right view, Cube 1's right is yellow. So Cube 1's left face is yellow, but when viewed from the front, the left face of Cube 1 is hidden. So the front view shows front, and the right view shows right, but the left face of Cube 1 is also yellow.\n\nSo Cube 1 has:\n\n- Front: red\n- Right: yellow\n- Left: yellow\n- So the remaining faces are top and back.\n\nSince each color has two faces, Cube 1 has two blues left. So top and back must both be blue. Therefore:\n\nCube 1:\n\n- Front: red\n- Back: blue\n- Top: blue\n- Left: yellow\n- Right: yellow\n- Bottom: ?\n\nWait, no, Cube 1 has six faces: front, back, left, right, top, bottom. We've assigned front, back, left, right, top. So only bottom is left. Since Cube 1's front is red, right is yellow, left is yellow, back is blue, top is blue. That leaves bottom as the remaining color, which must be red or yellow. But Cube 1 already has two yellows and two blues. It has front and left as red and yellow? Wait, no, Cube 1's front is red, left is yellow, right is yellow, so that's two yellows. Front is red, back is blue, top is blue. So that's two blues, two yellows, and one red. But each cube needs two reds. So Cube 1 is missing another red face.\n\nTherefore, Cube 1's bottom face must be red. So:\n\nCube 1:\n\n- Front: red\n- Back: blue\n- Top: blue\n- Left: yellow\n- Right: yellow\n- Bottom: red\n\nYes, that makes sense. Each color has two faces: red on front and bottom, blue on back and top, yellow on left and right.\n\nNow, Cube 2:\n\nFrom front view, Cube 2's front is blue.\n\nFrom the right view, Cube 2's right face is red.\n\nSo Cube 2:\n\n- Front: blue\n- Right: red\n\nEach color has two faces, so Cube 2 has two blues, two reds, and two yellows.\n\nSince front is blue, right is red, the remaining faces are back, left, top, bottom.\n\nWe need to assign the remaining colors.\n\nCube 2 has:\n\n- Front: blue\n- Right: red\n\nSo it needs one more blue and one more red, and two yellows.\n\nBut wait, Cube 2 has two blues, so one more blue. Two reds, so one more red. Two yellows, so two yellows on the remaining faces.\n\nSo the remaining faces: back, left, top, bottom.\n\nWe need to assign:\n\n- One more blue\n- One more red\n- Two yellows\n\nSo, let's see.\n\nCube 2's front is blue, right is red.\n\nLet's assume Cube 2's back is blue, then left, top, bottom must be red and yellow. But we need two yellows, so maybe top and bottom are yellow, and left is red.\n\nBut let's check if that works.\n\nCube 2:\n\n- Front: blue\n- Back: blue\n- Right: red\n- Left: red\n- Top: yellow\n- Bottom: yellow\n\nYes, that works. Each color has two faces.\n\nAlternatively, Cube 2's back could be something else, but let's see.\n\nAlternatively, Cube 2's back could be yellow, but then we need another blue, so perhaps top is blue, but then Cube 2's front is blue, back is yellow, top is blue, but that would mean three blues, which is not allowed. So Cube 2's back must be blue, leaving left, top, bottom as red and yellow.\n\nSince Cube 2 has right as red, left is opposite to right, so left is red as well? Wait, no, in a cube, left and right are opposite. So if Cube 2's right is red, the left is also red, but that would mean two reds on Cube 2: right and left. Then, front is blue, back is blue, top and bottom are yellow.\n\nYes, that works.\n\nSo Cube 2:\n\n- Front: blue\n- Back: blue\n- Left: red\n- Right: red\n- Top: yellow\n- Bottom: yellow\n\nNow, Cube 3:\n\nFrom front view, Cube 3's front is yellow.\n\nFrom the right view, Cube 3's right face is blue.\n\nSo Cube 3:\n\n- Front: yellow\n- Right: blue\n\nEach color has two faces, so Cube 3 needs one more yellow and one more blue, and two reds.\n\nSo remaining faces: back, left, top, bottom.\n\nWe need:\n\n- One more yellow\n- One more blue\n- Two reds\n\nSo let's assign.\n\nCube 3's front is yellow, right is blue.\n\nLet's say Cube 3's back is yellow, then left, top, bottom must be blue and red. But we need one more blue and two reds.\n\nWait, if Cube 3's back is yellow, then:\n\n- Front: yellow\n- Back: yellow\n- Right: blue\n- So we need one more blue on Cube 3, and two reds.\n\nSo remaining faces: left, top, bottom.\n\nAssign:\n\n- Left: blue\n- Top: red\n- Bottom: red\n\nYes, that works.\n\nSo Cube 3:\n\n- Front: yellow\n- Back: yellow\n- Right: blue\n- Left: blue\n- Top: red\n- Bottom: red\n\nWait, but Cube 3's right face is blue, and left is opposite to right, so left is blue as well. That gives two blues on Cube 3: left and right. Front and back are yellow. Then top and bottom are red. That works because each color has two faces.\n\nNow, let's recap the cubes:\n\nCube 1:\n\n- Front: red\n- Back: blue\n- Top: blue\n- Left: yellow\n- Right: yellow\n- Bottom: red\n\nCube 2:\n\n- Front: blue\n- Back: blue\n- Left: red\n- Right: red\n- Top: yellow\n- Bottom: yellow\n\nCube 3:\n\n- Front: yellow\n- Back: yellow\n- Left: blue\n- Right: blue\n- Top: red\n- Bottom: red\n\nNow, the question is: what colors do we see from the top, reading left to right?\n\nFrom the top view, we'll see the top faces of each cube in the order Cube 1, Cube 2, Cube 3.\n\nSo:\n\n- Cube 1's top face: blue\n- Cube 2's top face: yellow\n- Cube 3's top face: red\n\nTherefore, from the top, reading left to right, we see blue, yellow, red.\n\nWait, but let me double-check.\n\nCube 1's top is blue.\n\nCube 2's top is yellow.\n\nCube 3's top is red.\n\nSo the sequence is blue, yellow, red.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't mix up any colors.\n\nCube 1's top is blue because Cube 1's top is blue, as per Cube 1's configuration.\n\nCube 2's top is yellow, as per Cube 2's configuration.\n\nCube 3's top is red, as per Cube 3's configuration.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo the top view from left to right is blue, yellow, red.\n\nBut wait, the problem is about what colors would you see when looking at the cubes from the top, reading from left to right. So the answer is blue, yellow, red.\n\nBut let me make sure there's no mistake in Cube 3's configuration.\n\nCube 3's front is yellow, back is yellow, left is blue, right is blue, top is red, bottom is red.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, Cube 2's top is yellow, Cube 1's top is blue.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the answer is blue, yellow, red.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. The problem says each cube has exactly two faces of each color. Let me check each cube.\n\nCube 1:\n\n- Front: red\n- Back: blue\n- Top: blue\n- Left: yellow\n- Right: yellow\n- Bottom: red\n\nColors:\n\n- Red: front, bottom (2)\n- Blue: back, top (2)\n- Yellow: left, right (2)\n\nYes.\n\nCube 2:\n\n- Front: blue\n- Back: blue\n- Left: red\n- Right: red\n- Top: yellow\n- Bottom: yellow\n\nColors:\n\n- Blue: front, back (2)\n- Red: left, right (2)\n- Yellow: top, bottom (2)\n\nYes.\n\nCube 3:\n\n- Front: yellow\n- Back: yellow\n- Left: blue\n- Right: blue\n- Top: red\n- Bottom: red\n\nColors:\n\n- Yellow: front, back (2)\n- Blue: left, right (2)\n- Red: top, bottom (2)\n\nYes.\n\nAll correct.\n\nSo from the top, left to right: Cube 1's top is blue, Cube 2's top is yellow, Cube 3's top is red. So the sequence is blue, yellow, red.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"reading from left to right,\" which is the same as the front view order, which is red, blue, yellow. But from the top, it's different.\n\nYes, from the front: red, blue, yellow.\n\nFrom the right: yellow, red, blue.\n\nFrom the top: blue, yellow, red.\n\nSo the answer is blue, yellow, red.\n\nBut let me make sure that the orientations are correct.\n\nCube 1: Front is red, right is yellow, left is yellow, back is blue, top is blue, bottom is red.\n\nFrom the top, Cube 1 shows blue.\n\nCube 2: Front is blue, right is red, left is red, back is blue, top is yellow, bottom is yellow.\n\nFrom the top, Cube 2 shows yellow.\n\nCube 3: Front is yellow, right is blue, left is blue, back is yellow, top is red, bottom is red.\n\nFrom the top, Cube 3 shows red.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the answer is blue, yellow, red.\n</think>\n\nWhen viewed from the top, the colors observed from left to right are blue, yellow, and red.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Front and Right Views:**\n   - Front view (from left to right): Cube 1 (red), Cube 2 (blue), Cube 3 (yellow).\n   - Right view (from front to back): Cube 1 (yellow), Cube 2 (red), Cube 3 (blue).\n\n2. **Determine Each Cube's Faces:**\n   - **Cube 1:**\n     - Front: red\n     - Right: yellow (from right view)\n     - Therefore, left"

    "solution": "Solve this problem step by step. End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: You have three identical cubes. Each face of each cube is painted either red, blue, or yellow, with exactly two faces of each color on each cube. The cubes are placed in a row on a table. Looking at the cubes from the front, you see the colors [red, blue, yellow] from left to right. Looking at the cubes from the right side, you see the colors [yellow, red, blue] from front to back. What colors would you see when looking at the cubes from the top, reading from left to right? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this problem about three identical cubes, each with exactly two faces painted red, two blue, and two yellow. They\u2019re arranged in a row on a table. From the front, I see red, blue, yellow from left to right. From the right side, I see yellow, red, blue from front to back. I need to figure out what colors I would see from the top, reading left to right.\n\nFirst, I need to visualize the cubes and their orientations. Each cube has six faces: front, back, left, right, top, and bottom. Since each color has exactly two faces, each cube has two red, two blue, and two yellow faces.\n\nFrom the front, the colors are red, blue, yellow. So, the first cube (leftmost) has a red face on the front. The second cube has blue on the front, and the third has yellow on the front.\n\nFrom the right side, looking at the row from the right, the colors are yellow, red, blue from front to back. That means, looking at the right face of each cube, the first cube (rightmost) has yellow, the middle cube has red, and the leftmost cube has blue.\n\nWait, hold on. When looking from the right, front to back would mean that the rightmost cube is the first one we see, so the right face of the first cube (rightmost) is yellow, the second cube (middle) is red, and the third cube (leftmost) is blue. So, the right faces are yellow (rightmost), red (middle), blue (leftmost).\n\nNow, I need to figure out the orientation of each cube. Let me denote the cubes as Cube A (leftmost), Cube B (middle), and Cube C (rightmost).\n\nFrom the front:\n- Cube A: Front = Red\n- Cube B: Front = Blue\n- Cube C: Front = Yellow\n\nFrom the right:\n- Cube A (leftmost from the right view): Right face = Blue\n- Cube B: Right face = Red\n- Cube C (rightmost from the right view): Right face = Yellow\n\nWait, no. When looking from the right, the rightmost cube is Cube C, so the right face of Cube C is yellow. Then, moving back, Cube B's right face is red, and Cube A's right face is blue. So, from the right, front to back: Cube C (yellow), Cube B (red), Cube A (blue).\n\nNow, I need to figure out the top view. The top view would show the top faces of each cube, from left to right, which is Cube A, Cube B, Cube C.\n\nEach cube has two of each color, so I need to figure out the top faces.\n\nLet me consider Cube A first. Its front face is red, and its right face is blue. Since each cube has two red, two blue, and two yellow faces, the remaining faces are top and bottom, and the left and back.\n\nBut wait, each cube has front, back, left, right, top, bottom. So, for Cube A:\n\nFront = Red\nRight = Blue\nSo, the remaining faces are Left, Back, Top, Bottom. Each color must have exactly two faces. So, for Cube A, it has two red, two blue, and two yellow.\n\nSince Front is Red, and Right is Blue, the remaining colors must be Yellow on Back, Left, Top, and Bottom, but wait, each color only has two faces. So, for Cube A, Front and Right are Red and Blue. So, the remaining four faces (Left, Back, Top, Bottom) must have two Yellow and two of another color? No, wait, each color has exactly two faces on each cube. So, since Cube A has two Red, two Blue, and two Yellow, and Front is Red, Right is Blue, the remaining four faces (Left, Back, Top, Bottom) must consist of two Yellow and two of... Wait, but we've already used two Red and two Blue, so the remaining four faces must be two Yellow and two of another color? No, that can't be because each color has exactly two faces on each cube. So, Cube A must have:\n\n- Front: Red\n- Right: Blue\n- Then, the other four faces (Left, Back, Top, Bottom) must consist of two Yellow and two of another color. But wait, each color has exactly two faces on each cube. So, if Front is Red, Right is Blue, then Back must be Yellow because each color has two faces. Wait, no, because Back is opposite to Front, so if Front is Red, Back is also Red? No, because each cube has exactly two of each color. So, Front is Red, so Back can't be Red. Wait, that's a contradiction.\n\nWait, hold on. If each cube has exactly two faces of each color, then Front and Back can't both be Red because that would make four Red faces. So, Front is Red, so Back must be a different color. Similarly, Right is Blue, so Left must be a different color.\n\nLet me think again. For Cube A:\n\n- Front: Red\n- Right: Blue\n\nSince each color has exactly two faces, the remaining four faces (Left, Back, Top, Bottom) must have two Yellow and two of another color. But the other color can't be Red or Blue because each color is only two. So, the remaining faces must be two Yellow and two of, say, another color, but we only have three colors. Wait, no, each cube has exactly two of each color, so the remaining four faces must consist of two Yellow and two of another color, but we can't have another color because we've already used Red and Blue. So, this suggests that Cube A's Back and Left faces must be Yellow.\n\nWait, no, because each color only has two faces. So, if Front is Red, Back can't be Red, so Back must be another color. Similarly, Right is Blue, so Left must be another color.\n\nSo, for Cube A:\n\n- Front: Red\n- Right: Blue\n- So, Back: must be a different color. Since each color has two faces, and Front is Red, Back can't be Red. So, Back must be either Blue or Yellow.\n\nBut if Back is Blue, then Cube A would have three Blue faces: Front (Red), Right (Blue), Back (Blue). That's three Blue, which is more than two. So, that's not allowed.\n\nTherefore, Back must be Yellow. So:\n\n- Back: Yellow\n\nThen, the Left face must be the remaining color. Since Front is Red, Back is Yellow, Right is Blue, the Left face must be the remaining color, which is... Wait, we have three colors: Red, Blue, Yellow.\n\nWe've assigned:\n\n- Front: Red\n- Right: Blue\n- Back: Yellow\n\nSo, the Left face must be the remaining color, which is... Wait, all three colors have been used on the four faces (Front, Right, Back, Left). But each cube has exactly two of each color. So, this can't be. Therefore, my initial assumption must be wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps Cube A's Back is not Yellow. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nLet me try again.\n\nCube A:\n\n- Front: Red\n- Right: Blue\n\nEach color has exactly two faces on each cube.\n\nSo, the remaining four faces (Left, Back, Top, Bottom) must have two Yellow and two of another color. But since we only have three colors, the other color can't be introduced. So, perhaps the remaining four faces are two Yellow and two of the same color? But that would mean four faces of one color, which is not allowed.\n\nWait, no, each color has exactly two faces. So, the remaining four faces must consist of two Yellow and two of another color, but since we only have three colors, the other color can't be another color. So, this suggests that Cube A's Back and Left faces must be Yellow.\n\nWait, but then Cube A would have:\n\n- Front: Red\n- Right: Blue\n- Back: Yellow\n- Left: Yellow\n\nBut that's three Yellow faces, which is not allowed because each color has exactly two.\n\nSo, this is a problem. Therefore, my initial assumption must be wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps Cube A's Back is not Yellow. Maybe Cube A's Back is another color, but we have to ensure that each color only has two faces.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Since each cube has exactly two of each color, and Front is Red, Right is Blue, then the Back must be Yellow, because if Back were Red or Blue, we would have more than two of that color.\n\nSo, Back: Yellow\n\nThen, Left: ?\n\nSince we've used Red, Blue, Yellow on Front, Right, Back, the Left face must be the remaining color, which is... Wait, we've already used all three colors on the four faces, which is impossible because each color can only have two faces.\n\nTherefore, this suggests that my initial assumption about the right face of Cube A is incorrect.\n\nWait, from the right side, looking front to back, the colors are yellow, red, blue. So, for Cube C (rightmost), the right face is yellow. For Cube B (middle), the right face is red. For Cube A (leftmost), the right face is blue.\n\nWait, maybe I got that wrong. Let me clarify.\n\nWhen looking from the right, front to back, the order is Cube C (rightmost), then Cube B, then Cube A (leftmost). So, from the right, the first cube we see is Cube C, then Cube B, then Cube A.\n\nSo, the right face of Cube C is yellow, right face of Cube B is red, right face of Cube A is blue.\n\nSo, for Cube A, right face is blue.\n\nTherefore, for Cube A:\n\n- Front: Red\n- Right: Blue\n\nAs before.\n\nSo, Front: Red, Right: Blue, and each color has exactly two faces.\n\nSo, the remaining four faces (Left, Back, Top, Bottom) must have two Yellow and two of another color. But since we only have three colors, the other color can't be another color. So, this seems impossible.\n\nWait, perhaps the Back is another color, and the Left is Yellow, but then we have:\n\n- Front: Red\n- Right: Blue\n- Back: Yellow\n- Left: ?\n\nBut we've used Red, Blue, Yellow on Front, Right, Back. So, Left face must be... Wait, we can't have another color because each cube only has three colors.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I need to think about the cube's structure.\n\nEach cube has six faces: front, back, left, right, top, bottom.\n\nEach color has exactly two faces.\n\nSo, for Cube A:\n\n- Front: Red\n- Right: Blue\n\nTherefore, the other four faces (Left, Back, Top, Bottom) must consist of two Yellow and two of another color. But since each color can only have two faces, the other color can't be another color because we've already used Red and Blue. So, the other four faces must be two Yellow and two of... Wait, but we only have three colors, so perhaps the other four faces are two Yellow and two of the same color, but that would mean four faces of one color, which is not allowed.\n\nWait, this is impossible. Therefore, my initial assumption must be wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I misinterpreted the right view.\n\nFrom the right, the colors are yellow, red, blue from front to back. So, for Cube C (rightmost), the right face is yellow. For Cube B (middle), the right face is red. For Cube A (leftmost), the right face is blue.\n\nSo, Cube A's right face is blue, Cube B's right face is red, Cube C's right face is yellow.\n\nTherefore, for Cube A:\n\n- Front: Red\n- Right: Blue\n\nSo, the Back face must be opposite to Front, which is Red. But since each color has exactly two faces, Back can't be Red. Therefore, Back must be another color.\n\nSimilarly, the Left face must be another color.\n\nSo, let's see:\n\nCube A:\n\n- Front: Red\n- Right: Blue\n\nRemaining colors: Yellow.\n\nEach color has two faces, so we need two Yellow faces on Cube A.\n\nTherefore, the remaining four faces (Left, Back, Top, Bottom) must have two Yellow and two of another color, but since we only have three colors, the other color can't be another color. So, the remaining four faces must be two Yellow and two of the same color, but that would mean four faces of one color, which is not allowed.\n\nWait, this is impossible. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in assigning the right face of Cube A.\n\nWait, maybe Cube A's right face is not blue. Let me think again.\n\nFrom the right, front to back: Cube C (rightmost) has right face yellow, Cube B has right face red, Cube A has right face blue.\n\nTherefore, Cube A's right face is blue.\n\nBut then, Cube A's Front is Red, Right is Blue, so the Back must be Yellow because each color has two faces.\n\nWait, no, because if Front is Red, Back can't be Red, so Back must be another color. Similarly, Right is Blue, Left must be another color.\n\nSo, Cube A:\n\n- Front: Red\n- Right: Blue\n- Back: Yellow\n- Left: ?\n\nWe have three colors: Red, Blue, Yellow.\n\nEach color has two faces on each cube.\n\nSo, Front: Red (1), Back: Yellow (1). Right: Blue (1), Left: ?\n\nWe need two of each color.\n\nSo, Red: Front and Back? No, because Front is Red, and Back can't be Red because each color has two faces. So, Front is Red, so Back must be another color.\n\nWait, this is confusing.\n\nLet me try to assign Cube A's faces step by step.\n\nCube A:\n\n- Front: Red\n- Right: Blue\n\nSo, we've used two Red and two Blue. Wait, no, each color has exactly two faces on each cube.\n\nWait, each cube has two Red, two Blue, two Yellow. So, on Cube A, Front is Red, Right is Blue. That's one Red and one Blue.\n\nSo, remaining: one Red, one Blue, two Yellow.\n\nBut each color must have exactly two faces. So, Cube A needs one more Red, one more Blue, and two Yellow.\n\nSo, the remaining faces (Left, Back, Top, Bottom) must consist of one Red, one Blue, and two Yellow.\n\nBut the faces are four in number. So, we need to assign:\n\n- Left: ?\n- Back: ?\n- Top: ?\n- Bottom: ?\n\nWith the remaining colors: one Red, one Blue, two Yellow.\n\nBut how?\n\nEach face is a single color. So, we have to assign each of Left, Back, Top, Bottom to one of these colors, with two Yellow and one Red and one Blue.\n\nSo, possible assignments:\n\n- Left: Yellow\n- Back: Yellow\n- Top: Red\n- Bottom: Blue\n\nOr:\n\n- Left: Yellow\n- Back: Yellow\n- Top: Blue\n- Bottom: Red\n\nOr other permutations.\n\nBut we need to make sure that each color has exactly two faces on the cube.\n\nSo, if I assign:\n\n- Left: Yellow\n- Back: Yellow\n- Top: Red\n- Bottom: Blue\n\nThen, Cube A would have:\n\n- Front: Red\n- Right: Blue\n- Left: Yellow\n- Back: Yellow\n- Top: Red\n- Bottom: Blue\n\nSo, colors per cube:\n\n- Red: Front, Top\n- Blue: Right, Bottom\n- Yellow: Left, Back\n\nThat works because each color has exactly two faces.\n\nAlternatively, another arrangement could be:\n\n- Left: Yellow\n- Back: Yellow\n- Top: Blue\n- Bottom: Red\n\nThen:\n\n- Front: Red\n- Right: Blue\n- Left: Yellow\n- Back: Yellow\n- Top: Blue\n- Bottom: Red\n\nSo, Red: Front, Bottom\n\nBlue: Right, Top\n\nYellow: Left, Back\n\nThat also works.\n\nSo, Cube A could have two Yellow faces on Back and Left, and the remaining faces (Top and Bottom) being Red and Blue.\n\nSimilarly, for Cube B:\n\nFront: Blue\n\nFrom the front view, Cube B's Front is Blue.\n\nFrom the right view, Cube B's Right face is Red.\n\nSo, Cube B:\n\n- Front: Blue\n- Right: Red\n\nSimilarly, we have to assign the remaining faces: Left, Back, Top, Bottom.\n\nEach color has two faces.\n\nSo, on Cube B:\n\n- Front: Blue (1)\n- Right: Red (1)\n\nRemaining: one Blue, one Red, two Yellow.\n\nSo, similar to Cube A, the remaining four faces must have one Blue, one Red, and two Yellow.\n\nSo, possible assignments:\n\n- Left: Yellow\n- Back: Yellow\n- Top: Blue\n- Bottom: Red\n\nOr:\n\n- Left: Yellow\n- Back: Yellow\n- Top: Red\n- Bottom: Blue\n\nSo, let's choose one. Let's say:\n\nCube B:\n\n- Front: Blue\n- Right: Red\n- Left: Yellow\n- Back: Yellow\n- Top: Blue\n- Bottom: Red\n\nSo, colors:\n\n- Blue: Front, Top\n- Red: Right, Bottom\n- Yellow: Left, Back\n\nSimilarly, Cube C:\n\nFront: Yellow\n\nFrom the front view, Cube C's Front is Yellow.\n\nFrom the right view, Cube C's Right face is Yellow.\n\nSo, Cube C:\n\n- Front: Yellow\n- Right: Yellow\n\nTherefore, the remaining faces (Left, Back, Top, Bottom) must have two Blue and two Red.\n\nBecause each color has exactly two faces on each cube.\n\nSo, Cube C:\n\n- Front: Yellow (1)\n- Right: Yellow (2)\n\nTherefore, remaining faces: Left, Back, Top, Bottom must have two Blue and two Red.\n\nSo, possible assignments:\n\n- Left: Blue\n- Back: Blue\n- Top: Red\n- Bottom: Red\n\nOr:\n\n- Left: Blue\n- Back: Red\n- Top: Blue\n- Bottom: Red\n\nWait, but each color can only have two faces.\n\nSo, let's assign:\n\n- Left: Blue\n- Back: Blue\n- Top: Red\n- Bottom: Red\n\nThen, Cube C would have:\n\n- Front: Yellow\n- Right: Yellow\n- Left: Blue\n- Back: Blue\n- Top: Red\n- Bottom: Red\n\nSo, colors:\n\n- Yellow: Front, Right\n- Blue: Left, Back\n- Red: Top, Bottom\n\nThat works.\n\nNow, we have all three cubes with their front, right, and other faces assigned.\n\nNow, we need to figure out the top view, which would show the Top faces of each cube, from left to right: Cube A, Cube B, Cube C.\n\nSo, what are the Top faces of each cube?\n\nCube A: Top face is Red (from earlier assignment)\n\nCube B: Top face is Blue (from earlier assignment)\n\nCube C: Top face is Red (from earlier assignment"

    "solution": "Solve this problem step by step. End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: You have three identical cubes. Each face of each cube is painted either red, blue, or yellow, with exactly two faces of each color on each cube. The cubes are placed in a row on a table. Looking at the cubes from the front, you see the colors [red, blue, yellow] from left to right. Looking at the cubes from the right side, you see the colors [yellow, red, blue] from front to back. What colors would you see when looking at the cubes from the top, reading from left to right? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I've got this problem about three identical cubes, each with exactly two faces painted red, blue, and yellow. The cubes are placed in a row, and I have some information about how they look from the front and the right side. My goal is to figure out what colors I'll see from the top when looking at them from left to right.\n\nFirst, let me try to visualize the setup. There are three cubes in a row. From the front, they appear as red, blue, yellow. So, the front face of the first cube is red, the second is blue, and the third is yellow. That makes sense because each cube has two faces of each color, so the front face is one color, and the others are distributed accordingly.\n\nNow, looking at the cubes from the right side, the colors I see are yellow, red, blue from front to back. So, if I'm looking at the rightmost cube (the third one) from the right side, I see yellow. That must mean that the right face of the third cube is yellow. Then, looking at the second cube from the right, I see red, so the right face of the second cube is red. Similarly, looking at the first cube from the right, I see blue, so the right face of the first cube is blue.\n\nLet me try to sketch this out mentally. Each cube has six faces: front, back, left, right, top, and bottom. Since each cube has exactly two faces of each color, the front face is red for the first cube, blue for the second, and yellow for the third. That leaves the back, left, right, top, and bottom faces to be distributed with the remaining colors.\n\nFor the first cube (front face red), the back face must be one of the other colors, but since each cube has exactly two of each color, the back face could be blue or yellow. Similarly, the left, right, top, and bottom faces need to be arranged such that each color appears exactly twice.\n\nBut wait, I also have information from the right side view. The rightmost cube (third) has its right face yellow. So, the third cube's right face is yellow. Since the front face of the third cube is yellow, that means the top and bottom faces, as well as the back and left faces, need to be red and blue. But since each color must appear exactly twice, the top and bottom must be one color, and the back and left must be the other.\n\nSimilarly, the second cube from the right (second cube) has its right face red. So, the second cube's right face is red. Its front face is blue, so the back, left, top, and bottom must be red and yellow. Again, each color must appear exactly twice, so the top and bottom will be one color, and the back and left will be the other.\n\nThe first cube from the right (first cube) has its right face blue. Its front face is red, so the back, left, top, and bottom must be blue and yellow. Each color must appear twice, so top and bottom will be one, back and left will be the other.\n\nNow, I need to figure out how the top faces look when viewed from the top, reading left to right. So, I need to determine the color of the top face of each cube from left to right.\n\nLet me denote the cubes as Cube 1 (front red), Cube 2 (front blue), Cube 3 (front yellow).\n\nFrom the right side view:\n\n- Cube 3's right face is yellow.\n- Cube 2's right face is red.\n- Cube 1's right face is blue.\n\nSo, for each cube:\n\nCube 1: Front - red, Right - blue. Therefore, the back, left, top, bottom must be yellow and blue (since each color must have exactly two faces). But wait, front is red, right is blue. So, the back must be another color. Let's think:\n\nEach cube has exactly two of each color. So, Cube 1 has front (red), right (blue). Therefore, the remaining faces (back, left, top, bottom) must include two yellows and one red? Wait, no, because each color must have exactly two faces on each cube. So, Cube 1 has front red, right blue, so the remaining four faces (back, left, top, bottom) must include two reds and two blues? No, that can't be because each color can only have two faces on the entire cube. So, if front is red, right is blue, then the remaining four faces (back, left, top, bottom) must include two reds and two blues? Wait, no, because each cube must have exactly two of each color. So, Cube 1 has front (red), right (blue). Therefore, the other four faces must be two reds and two blues? No, that can't be because each color is only allowed two faces on the entire cube. So, if front is red, right is blue, then the remaining four faces can't have any more reds or blues. Wait, that's not possible because each cube must have exactly two of each color.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake. Each cube has six faces, and each color is used exactly twice. So, each cube has two red, two blue, and two yellow faces.\n\nSo, Cube 1: front is red, right is blue. Therefore, the remaining four faces (back, left, top, bottom) must consist of one red and one blue, but that would only give a total of two reds and two blues, but we need two of each. So, actually, Cube 1 has front (red), right (blue), so the remaining four faces must include one red and one blue, but that's only five faces. Wait, that can't be right. I must be confusing something.\n\nWait, no. Each cube has six faces. If front is red, right is blue, then the remaining four faces (back, left, top, bottom) must include the other two reds and two blues, but that's four faces. So, Cube 1: front (red), right (blue). Therefore, back, left, top, bottom must be two reds and two blues.\n\nBut how? Let's say Cube 1's front is red, right is blue. Then, the back, left, top, bottom must have two reds and two blues. So, perhaps back is red, left is blue, top is red, bottom is blue. Or some other combination.\n\nSimilarly, Cube 2: front is blue, right is red. So, back, left, top, bottom must have two blues and two reds.\n\nCube 3: front is yellow, right is yellow. Wait, no, from the right side view, the right face of Cube 3 is yellow. So, Cube 3's front is yellow, right is yellow. Therefore, the remaining four faces (back, left, top, bottom) must have two yellows and two other colors, but each cube can only have two of each color. So, Cube 3 has front (yellow), right (yellow). Therefore, the remaining four faces must be two reds and two blues.\n\nSo, for Cube 3: front (yellow), right (yellow). Back, left, top, bottom must be two reds and two blues.\n\nNow, let's think about the top view. When looking at the cubes from the top, we'll see the top faces of each cube from left to right, which are Cube 1's top, Cube 2's top, Cube 3's top.\n\nSo, I need to figure out what color each top face is.\n\nLet's start with Cube 1: front (red), right (blue). Remaining faces: back, left, top, bottom must be two reds and two blues.\n\nIf I can figure out the arrangement, I can determine the top face.\n\nSimilarly, Cube 2: front (blue), right (red). Remaining faces: back, left, top, bottom must be two blues and two reds.\n\nCube 3: front (yellow), right (yellow). Remaining faces: back, left, top, bottom must be two reds and two blues.\n\nI need to make sure that the cubes are placed in a way that the front, right, and top views are consistent.\n\nLet me try to assign colors to the top faces.\n\nStarting with Cube 1: front (red), right (blue). Let's assume that the top face is blue. Then, the bottom would be red, since each color has to be used twice. So, Cube 1: top (blue), bottom (red). Then, the back and left would be the other colors. So, back and left would be red and blue. But since front is red, right is blue, and top is blue, bottom is red, then back and left must be red and blue. Let's say back is red and left is blue.\n\nWait, but then Cube 1 would have front (red), right (blue), top (blue), bottom (red), back (red), left (blue). That would give three reds and three blues, which is not allowed because each color can only have two faces. So, that's a problem.\n\nTherefore, Cube 1 can't have top as blue because that would require three blues. So, maybe top is red. If top is red, then bottom is blue. So, Cube 1: front (red), right (blue), top (red), bottom (blue). Then, back and left must be blue and red. Let's say back is blue and left is red.\n\nBut then Cube 1 would have front (red), right (blue), top (red), bottom (blue), back (blue), left (red). That's two reds and two blues, which is correct.\n\nSimilarly, for Cube 2: front (blue), right (red). Let's try to figure out the top face.\n\nIf Cube 2's top is red, then bottom is blue. So, front (blue), right (red), top (red), bottom (blue). Then, back and left would be blue and red. Let's say back is red and left is blue. Then, Cube 2 would have front (blue), right (red), top (red), bottom (blue), back (red), left (blue). That's two blues and two reds, which is correct.\n\nCube 3: front (yellow), right (yellow). So, remaining faces: back, left, top, bottom must be two reds and two blues.\n\nLet's try to assign top as red. Then, bottom is blue. So, Cube 3: front (yellow), right (yellow), top (red), bottom (blue). Then, back and left must be blue and red. Let's say back is blue and left is red. So, Cube 3: front (yellow), right (yellow), top (red), bottom (blue), back (blue), left (red). That's two yellows, two reds, and two blues, which is correct.\n\nAlternatively, Cube 3 could have top as blue, but let's check if that works. If top is blue, then bottom is red. So, Cube 3: front (yellow), right (yellow), top (blue), bottom (red). Then, back and left must be red and blue. Let's say back is red and left is blue. Then, Cube 3 would have front (yellow), right (yellow), top (blue), bottom (red), back (red), left (blue). That's two yellows, two reds, two blues, which is also correct.\n\nBut we need to make sure that the arrangement is consistent with the way the cubes are placed. Let me think about the orientation of each cube.\n\nCube 1: front (red), right (blue), top (red), bottom (blue), back (blue), left (red). So, if we're looking at the top, the top face is red.\n\nCube 2: front (blue), right (red), top (red), bottom (blue), back (red), left (blue). So, top face is red.\n\nCube 3: front (yellow), right (yellow), top (red), bottom (blue), back (blue), left (red). So, top face is red.\n\nWait, but from the top view, all three cubes would show red. But let me check Cube 3's alternative arrangement where top is blue.\n\nCube 3: front (yellow), right (yellow), top (blue), bottom (red), back (red), left (blue). So, top face is blue.\n\nBut we need to see if this affects the other cubes.\n\nWait, but if Cube 3's top is blue, then the orientation might affect how the other cubes are placed relative to each other. However, since the cubes are placed in a row, their orientations are independent except for the front, right, and top views.\n\nBut I think the key is that each cube's top face is determined by its own arrangement, regardless of the others. So, both possibilities for Cube 3's top face are valid, but we need to see which one fits the overall arrangement.\n\nWait, but let's think about the right side view again. For Cube 3, the right face is yellow, which is consistent in both arrangements. Similarly, for Cube 2, the right face is red, which is also consistent.\n\nSo, both arrangements for Cube 3's top face are possible. However, the problem is asking for the colors seen from the top, reading left to right. So, if Cube 1's top is red, Cube 2's top is red, and Cube 3's top is red, the answer would be [red, red, red]. But that seems unlikely because each cube's top face is determined by its own arrangement, and perhaps there's a more logical arrangement.\n\nAlternatively, if Cube 3's top is blue, then the top view would be [red, red, blue]. Let me check if that's possible.\n\nWait, but let's think again about Cube 1. If Cube 1's top is red, then bottom is blue, back is blue, left is red. So, the cube is oriented with front (red), right (blue), top (red), bottom (blue), back (blue), left (red). That's acceptable.\n\nCube 2: front (blue), right (red), top (red), bottom (blue), back (red), left (blue). So, top is red.\n\nCube 3: front (yellow), right (yellow), top (blue), bottom (red), back (red), left (blue). So, top is blue.\n\nThis seems possible. But does this arrangement cause any conflict? Let me check the right side view again.\n\nFor Cube 3, right face is yellow, which is correct. For Cube 2, right face is red, which is correct. For Cube 1, right face is blue, which is correct.\n\nSo, the top view would be [red (Cube1), red (Cube2), blue (Cube3)]. So, the colors from left to right would be red, red, blue.\n\nBut wait, let me see if there's another way to arrange Cube 3's top face as red, making the top view all reds.\n\nCube 3: front (yellow), right (yellow), top (red), bottom (blue), back (blue), left (red). So, top is red. Then, the top view would be [red, red, red].\n\nBut is this arrangement possible? Let's see.\n\nCube 3: front (yellow), right (yellow), top (red), bottom (blue), back (blue), left (red). So, yes, that works because each color is used twice.\n\nSimilarly, Cube 2: front (blue), right (red), top (red), bottom (blue), back (red), left (blue). So, top is red.\n\nCube 1: front (red), right (blue), top (red), bottom (blue), back (blue), left (red). So, top is red.\n\nTherefore, both arrangements are possible. But the problem is asking for a specific answer, so perhaps there's a unique solution.\n\nWait, maybe I missed something. Let me think about the orientation of the cubes. When looking from the top, the cube's orientation might affect how the colors are seen. But since the cubes are placed in a row, their orientations are fixed relative to the table.\n\nWait, but the problem doesn't specify any constraints on the top view except what's derived from the front and right views. So, perhaps both arrangements are possible, but the problem expects a unique answer. Maybe I need to consider that each cube's top face is determined uniquely by the front and right views.\n\nWait, let me try another approach. Let's consider that each cube's top face must be a color different from its front and right faces, but that's not necessarily true because the top face could be the same as front or right.\n\nBut in Cube 1, front is red, right is blue, and top could be red or blue or yellow. But since each color has exactly two faces, and front and right are already red and blue, the top can't be yellow because that would require three yellows on the cube, which isn't allowed. So, Cube 1's top must be either red or blue.\n\nSimilarly, Cube 2: front is blue, right is red. So, top must be either blue or red.\n\nCube 3: front is yellow, right is yellow. So, top must be either red or blue.\n\nTherefore, Cube 1's top is red or blue.\n\nCube 2's top is red or blue.\n\nCube 3's top is red or blue.\n\nBut each color must be used exactly twice on each cube.\n\nSo, for Cube 1, if top is red, then bottom is blue (since front is red, right is blue, top is red, bottom is blue, back and left must be blue and red). Wait, but that would require Cube 1 to have three reds (front, top, and one more). No, wait, each color can only have two faces. So, Cube 1's front is red, right is blue, top is red, so that's two reds. Then, bottom must be blue, and back and left must be blue and red, but that would require three blues, which is not allowed.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.\n\nEach cube must have exactly two of each color. So, for Cube 1:\n\n- Front: red\n- Right: blue\n- Therefore, the remaining four faces (back, left, top, bottom) must include two reds and two blues.\n\nBut since front and right are already red and blue, the remaining four faces can't have any more reds or blues beyond two each. So, the remaining four faces must be two reds and two blues. Therefore, Cube 1's top and bottom, back, and left must be arranged such that two are red and two are blue.\n\nSimilarly, Cube 2:\n\n- Front: blue\n- Right: red\n- Remaining four faces: two blues and two reds.\n\nCube 3:\n\n- Front: yellow\n- Right: yellow\n- Remaining four faces: two reds and two blues.\n\nSo, for Cube 1:\n\nIf top is red, then bottom must be blue ("

    "solution": "Solve this problem step by step. End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: You have three identical cubes. Each face of each cube is painted either red, blue, or yellow, with exactly two faces of each color on each cube. The cubes are placed in a row on a table. Looking at the cubes from the front, you see the colors [red, blue, yellow] from left to right. Looking at the cubes from the right side, you see the colors [yellow, red, blue] from front to back. What colors would you see when looking at the cubes from the top, reading from left to right? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this problem with three identical cubes, each with exactly two faces painted red, two blue, and two yellow. The cubes are placed in a row on a table. When viewed from the front, the colors are red, blue, yellow from left to right. From the right side, the colors are yellow, red, blue from front to back. I need to figure out what colors I would see from the top, reading left to right.\n\nFirst, I should visualize the cubes. Each cube has six faces, and exactly two of each color: red, blue, and yellow. So, each cube has two red faces, two blue faces, and two yellow faces.\n\nWhen looking at the cubes from the front, the front faces show red, blue, and yellow. So, the left cube's front face is red, the middle cube's front face is blue, and the right cube's front face is yellow.\n\nNow, from the right side, the colors are yellow, red, blue from front to back. This means that when I look at the right side of the entire row, the front cube's right face is yellow, the middle cube's right face is red, and the right cube's right face is blue.\n\nI need to figure out how the cubes are oriented relative to each other. Since the cubes are identical and placed in a row, each cube must be positioned such that the front face is visible, and the right face of each cube is visible to the right side.\n\nLet me try to sketch this out mentally. Each cube is a standard cube, so each face is adjacent to four other faces (front, back, left, right, top, bottom). Since each cube has two red, two blue, and two yellow faces, each color is used exactly twice on each cube.\n\nFrom the front view, the front face colors are red, blue, yellow. So, the first cube's front is red, second is blue, third is yellow.\n\nFrom the right view, the right faces are yellow, red, blue. So, the first cube's right face is yellow, second cube's right face is red, third cube's right face is blue.\n\nNow, I need to figure out the orientation of each cube. Each cube can be rotated around the vertical axis (top to bottom), and also around the horizontal axis (front to back), which affects which faces are visible from the sides and top.\n\nLet me start with the first cube. Its front face is red, and its right face is yellow. So, if I imagine the cube, the front is red, and the right face is yellow. Since each cube has two red, two blue, and two yellow faces, the back face of the first cube must be another color. Since the front is red, the back is also red (because two red faces per cube). Wait, no, each cube has two of each color. So, if the front is red, the back must be another color. Wait, no, the back face is opposite the front. So, if front is red, back is another color. But since each cube has two red faces, the front and back can't both be red. So, actually, the front is red, and the back is a different color.\n\nWait, hold on. Each cube has two red, two blue, and two yellow faces. So, the front face is red, and the back face must be another color, but since there are two red faces, the other red face must be on another side.\n\nSo, the first cube has front face red. Since the right face is yellow, the cube must be rotated so that the right face is yellow. That means the cube is rotated 90 degrees to the right relative to the front face. So, if I look at the first cube from the front, the front is red, and the right face is yellow, then the top face would be blue or something else.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to assign coordinates. Let me assign the front face as the x-axis, right face as the y-axis, and top face as the z-axis.\n\nSo, for the first cube:\n\n- Front face: red (x+ direction)\n- Right face: yellow (y+ direction)\n- Then, the top face would be determined by the orientation.\n\nSince each cube has two red faces, front and back. So, front is red, back is another color. But since the cube has two red faces, and front is red, the back must also be red, but that's impossible because the back is opposite the front. Wait, no, each cube has two red faces, but they can be adjacent or opposite. Wait, no, in a cube, opposite faces are opposite each other. So, if the front is red, the back must be another color, but the cube has two red faces. So, the front and back can't both be red. Therefore, the two red faces must be adjacent. So, front is red, and one of the side faces is red.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the two red faces on each cube are adjacent, not opposite. So, front is red, and one of the side faces (left, right, top, bottom) is also red. Similarly for blue and yellow.\n\nSo, for the first cube, front is red, right is yellow. So, the right face is yellow, which is one of the two yellow faces on the cube. Therefore, the left face of the first cube must be another color. Since the cube has two yellow faces, one is on the right, the other must be on the left? No, because the left face is a different face. Wait, the cube has six faces: front, back, left, right, top, bottom.\n\nEach cube has two red, two blue, and two yellow faces. So, for the first cube, front is red, right is yellow. Therefore, the remaining faces are back, left, top, bottom. Among these, we have one red, two blue, and one yellow? Wait, no. Let's count:\n\n- Front: red\n- Right: yellow\n- So, remaining faces: back, left, top, bottom\n- Colors remaining: one red, two blue, one yellow\n\nWait, no, the cube has two red, two blue, and two yellow. So, if front is red, right is yellow, then the other red face must be on either back, left, top, or bottom. Similarly, the other yellow face must be on one of those.\n\nSo, for the first cube:\n\n- Front: red\n- Right: yellow\n- Therefore, the other yellow face must be on either left, back, top, or bottom.\n\nSimilarly, the other red face is on one of those.\n\nBut we also have to consider that the cube has two blue faces, which must be on two of the remaining faces.\n\nSo, let's say the first cube has front red, right yellow, and let's assume that the top face is blue. Then, the bottom face would be another color. Wait, but we need to figure out the orientation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to consider the cube's orientation relative to the front and right faces.\n\nGiven that front is red and right is yellow, the cube must be rotated such that the front is red and the right is yellow. So, the cube is rotated 90 degrees clockwise when viewed from above, making the right face yellow.\n\nIn this orientation, the top face would then be blue or another color.\n\nWait, let me think about the cube. If front is red and right is yellow, then the top face could be blue or another color. Let's say the top is blue; then, the bottom would be another color. But since the cube has two blue faces, the other blue face would be on the back or left.\n\nAlternatively, if the top is yellow, but we already have the right face as yellow, and the cube only has two yellow faces, so the top can't be yellow. So, the top must be blue.\n\nSo, for the first cube:\n\n- Front: red\n- Right: yellow\n- Top: blue\n- Therefore, the left face would be the remaining color. Since we have two blue faces, the top is blue, so the other blue face is on the left or back.\n\nWait, the cube has two blue faces. If top is blue, the other blue face must be on the left or back. Let's say the left face is blue. Then, the back face would be red, but front is red, and each cube can only have two red faces. So, front is red, and back would have to be another color. Wait, no, if front is red and the cube has two red faces, the other red face must be adjacent, not opposite.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let's try to map it out.\n\nEach cube has two red, two blue, and two yellow faces. The front is red, the right is yellow. So, the two red faces on the cube are front and another face. Since front is red, the other red face must be adjacent, so it's either the top, bottom, left, or right. But the right is already yellow, so the other red face must be top, bottom, or left.\n\nSimilarly, the two yellow faces are front's right (yellow) and another face, which could be left, back, top, or bottom.\n\nLet me try to assign:\n\nFirst cube:\n\n- Front: red\n- Right: yellow\n- Therefore, the other yellow face must be on either left, back, top, or bottom.\n\nSimilarly, the other red face must be on left, back, top, or bottom.\n\nAlso, the two blue faces must be on the remaining two faces.\n\nSo, let's suppose that the top face is blue. Then, the bottom face is another color. Since the cube has two blue faces, the top is blue, the other blue face must be on the left, back, or bottom.\n\nIf top is blue, then the other blue face could be on the left or back.\n\nLet me try:\n\n- Front: red\n- Right: yellow\n- Top: blue\n- Left: blue\n- Then, back: ?\n\nSo, front is red, right is yellow, top is blue, left is blue. Then, the back face would be red, but we can't have front and back both red because each cube only has two red faces. Wait, no, front and back are opposite faces. If front is red, back must be another color. So, front is red, back is, say, yellow? But we already have right face as yellow. The cube has two yellow faces: right and back? But then the back is yellow, but the cube only has two yellow faces, which are right and back.\n\nWait, but then the left face is blue, top is blue, so the bottom face would be the remaining color, which is red.\n\nWait, let's count:\n\n- Front: red\n- Back: yellow\n- Right: yellow\n- Left: blue\n- Top: blue\n- Bottom: red\n\nYes, that works. So, the first cube has front red, back yellow, right yellow, left blue, top blue, bottom red.\n\nNow, let's check the second cube.\n\nFrom the front, the second cube's front face is blue. From the right side, the second cube's right face is red.\n\nSo, the second cube has front blue and right red.\n\nSimilarly, the third cube has front yellow and right blue.\n\nSo, let's analyze the second cube.\n\nSecond cube:\n\n- Front: blue\n- Right: red\n\nSo, similar to the first cube, the cube has two blue faces, two red, and two yellow.\n\nFront is blue, right is red. Therefore, the other red face must be on another side, and the other blue face must be on another side.\n\nAlso, the two yellow faces must be on two other sides.\n\nLet me try to figure out the orientation.\n\nIf the front is blue and the right is red, then the cube must be rotated such that front is blue, right is red.\n\nSo, similar to the first cube, the cube is rotated so that front is blue, right is red.\n\nThen, the top face would be another color.\n\nLet me assume the top face is yellow. Then, the bottom face would be another color.\n\nBut let's check the colors.\n\nSince the cube has two yellow faces, if top is yellow, the other yellow face must be on the back or left.\n\nWait, let's try:\n\n- Front: blue\n- Right: red\n- Top: yellow\n- Then, the other yellow face must be on the back or left.\n\nIf top is yellow, then the bottom would be another color.\n\nAlso, the two blue faces are front and another face.\n\nIf front is blue, the other blue face could be on the back, left, or top/bottom.\n\nBut top is yellow, so the other blue face must be on the back or left.\n\nLet me try:\n\n- Front: blue\n- Right: red\n- Top: yellow\n- Back: blue\n- Left: yellow\n- Bottom: red\n\nWait, that would give:\n\n- Front: blue\n- Back: blue\n- Right: red\n- Left: yellow\n- Top: yellow\n- Bottom: red\n\nBut wait, the cube has two blue faces, so front and back are both blue. That's okay. Two red faces: right and bottom. Two yellow faces: left and top.\n\nYes, that works.\n\nSo, second cube:\n\n- Front: blue\n- Back: blue\n- Right: red\n- Left: yellow\n- Top: yellow\n- Bottom: red\n\nNow, let's check the third cube.\n\nThird cube:\n\n- Front: yellow\n- Right: blue\n\nSo, front is yellow, right is blue.\n\nAgain, the cube has two yellow, two blue, and two red faces.\n\nFront is yellow, right is blue.\n\nSo, the other yellow face must be on another side, and the other blue face must be on another side.\n\nLet me try to figure out the orientation.\n\nIf front is yellow, right is blue, then the cube must be rotated such that front is yellow, right is blue.\n\nSo, similar to the first cube, the cube is rotated so that front is yellow, right is blue.\n\nThen, the top face would be another color.\n\nLet me assume the top face is red.\n\nThen, the bottom face would be another color.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nSo, front: yellow\n\nRight: blue\n\nTop: red\n\nThen, the other yellow face must be on the left, back, or bottom.\n\nSimilarly, the other blue face must be on the left, back, or bottom.\n\nAlso, the two red faces: front is yellow, right is blue, so the other red faces must be on the left, back, top, or bottom.\n\nWait, front is yellow, so the other yellow face is on another side.\n\nLet me try:\n\n- Front: yellow\n- Right: blue\n- Top: red\n- Left: red\n- Back: yellow\n- Bottom: blue\n\nWait, let's check:\n\n- Front: yellow\n- Back: yellow\n- Right: blue\n- Left: red\n- Top: red\n- Bottom: blue\n\nYes, that works.\n\nSo, third cube:\n\n- Front: yellow\n- Back: yellow\n- Right: blue\n- Left: red\n- Top: red\n- Bottom: blue\n\nNow, let's summarize the orientations of all three cubes.\n\nFirst cube:\n\n- Front: red\n- Back: yellow\n- Right: yellow\n- Left: blue\n- Top: blue\n- Bottom: red\n\nSecond cube:\n\n- Front: blue\n- Back: blue\n- Right: red\n- Left: yellow\n- Top: yellow\n- Bottom: red\n\nThird cube:\n\n- Front: yellow\n- Back: yellow\n- Right: blue\n- Left: red\n- Top: red\n- Bottom: blue\n\nNow, I need to figure out what colors I would see from the top, reading from left to right.\n\nSo, from the top view, I need to look at the top faces of each cube, from left to right.\n\nBut wait, each cube is placed in a row, so the first cube is on the far left, second in the middle, third on the far right.\n\nFrom the top view, we should see the top face of each cube.\n\nBut wait, the cube's orientation might affect which top face is visible.\n\nWait, actually, when looking at the top of the entire arrangement, each cube's top face is determined by its own orientation.\n\nBut in reality, when looking from the top, each cube's top face is the top face of the cube itself, which is determined by its own orientation relative to the table.\n\nWait, but in the problem, it's mentioned that the cubes are placed in a row on a table, so the table is the horizontal surface, and the cubes are stacked vertically on top of each other? Or are they placed side by side on the table?\n\nWait, the problem says \"placed in a row on a table.\" So, they are probably placed side by side on the table, each on their own, not stacked. So, each cube is on the table, adjacent to each other, forming a row.\n\nTherefore, when looking from the top, I would see the top faces of each cube, from left to right.\n\nBut each cube's top face is determined by its own orientation.\n\nSo, for each cube, the top face is the face that's on top when looking from above.\n\nBut in our earlier analysis, we assigned the top face as a specific color, but actually, when a cube is placed on a table, the top face is the one opposite the bottom face.\n\nWait, no, the top face is the one facing upwards. So, the top face is the face that is not on the table.\n\nSo, for each cube, the top face is the one opposite the bottom face, which is on the table.\n\nTherefore, to find the top face of each cube, I need to determine which face is opposite the bottom face, which is on the table.\n\nWait, but in our earlier analysis, we assigned the top face as blue, yellow, or red, but perhaps that was incorrect because the top face is determined by the cube's orientation relative to the table.\n\nSo, perhaps I need to adjust my earlier analysis.\n\nLet me clarify.\n\nEach cube is placed on the table, so the bottom face is on the table, and the top face is opposite the bottom.\n\nTherefore, the top face is determined by the cube's orientation relative to the table.\n\nSo, for each cube, the bottom face is on the table, and the top face is the one opposite.\n\nTherefore, when I look at the cube from the top, I see the top face.\n\nSo, to figure out the top face of each cube, I need to determine which face is opposite the bottom face, which is on the table.\n\nBut in our earlier analysis, we assigned the top face as a specific color, but perhaps that was incorrect because the top face is determined by the cube's orientation.\n\nSo, let me re-examine each cube.\n\nFirst cube:\n\n- Front: red\n- Right: yellow\n- Left: blue\n- Top: blue\n- Bottom: red\n\nWait, in this case, the top face is blue, and the bottom is red.\n\nBut if the cube is placed on the table, the bottom face is on the table, so the bottom is red, and the top is blue.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSimilarly, second cube:\n\n- Front: blue"

    "solution": "Solve this problem step by step. End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: You have three identical cubes. Each face of each cube is painted either red, blue, or yellow, with exactly two faces of each color on each cube. The cubes are placed in a row on a table. Looking at the cubes from the front, you see the colors [red, blue, yellow] from left to right. Looking at the cubes from the right side, you see the colors [yellow, red, blue] from front to back. What colors would you see when looking at the cubes from the top, reading from left to right? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem with three identical cubes, each painted with red, blue, and yellow on their faces. Each cube has exactly two faces of each color. They're placed in a row on a table, and I need to figure out what colors I'll see from the top when looking at them from left to right.\n\nFirst, let me try to visualize the setup. The cubes are placed in a row, so each cube is next to the other. When looking at them from the front, I see red, blue, yellow from left to right. That means the front face of the first cube is red, the front face of the second is blue, and the front face of the third is yellow.\n\nThen, from the right side, I see yellow, red, blue from front to back. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. So, when looking at the row from the right, the front cube (which is the third cube in the row) shows yellow on its back face, the middle cube (second cube) shows red on its back face, and the last cube (first cube) shows blue on its back face.\n\nWait, no, actually, when looking from the right, the front to back view would correspond to the right faces of each cube. So the first cube (leftmost) would be the right face of the first cube, the second cube's right face, and the third cube's right face. But the description says from the right, you see yellow, red, blue from front to back. So, front to back would mean the front cube (third in the row) is yellow, the middle cube (second) is red, and the last cube (first) is blue. So that translates to the right faces of the cubes being yellow (third cube), red (second cube), and blue (first cube).\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n- Front view (left to right): Cube 1 front = red, Cube 2 front = blue, Cube 3 front = yellow.\n\n- Right view (front to back): Cube 3 right = yellow, Cube 2 right = red, Cube 1 right = blue.\n\nNow, I need to figure out the top view. The top view would show the top faces of each cube from left to right, which are Cube 1 top, Cube 2 top, Cube 3 top.\n\nEach cube has exactly two faces of each color, and since they're cubes, each cube has 6 faces. So each color appears twice on each cube.\n\nI think I need to figure out the arrangement of colors on each cube. Let's consider each cube one by one.\n\nStarting with Cube 1:\n\n- Front face: red (from front view)\n- Right face: blue (from right view)\n\nSo, on Cube 1, the front is red, and the right is blue. Since each cube has two faces of each color, and each color appears on exactly two faces, we need to figure out where the other faces are.\n\nBut wait, each cube has six faces: front, back, left, right, top, bottom. So for Cube 1:\n\n- Front: red\n- Right: blue\n- So, the other four faces (back, left, top, bottom) need to have one red, one blue, and two yellows? Wait, no, each color has exactly two faces on each cube. So each cube has two red, two blue, and two yellow faces.\n\nSo, for Cube 1:\n\n- Front: red\n- Right: blue\n- Therefore, it needs one more red and one more blue on the other faces.\n\nSimilarly, Cube 2:\n\n- Front: blue\n- Right: red\n- So, it needs one more blue and one more red on the other faces.\n\nCube 3:\n\n- Front: yellow\n- Right: yellow\n- Wait, but the right face of Cube 3 is yellow, as per the right view. So, for Cube 3:\n\n- Front: yellow\n- Right: yellow\n- Therefore, it must have two yellows on the front and right, and the remaining four faces (back, left, top, bottom) must have two reds and two blues.\n\nBut wait, each cube has exactly two faces of each color. So Cube 3 has two yellows on front and right, so the other four faces (back, left, top, bottom) must be one red and one blue each? No, wait, no. Each color must have exactly two faces on each cube. So Cube 3 has two yellows, so the remaining four faces must have two reds and two blues.\n\nSimilarly, Cube 1 has front: red, right: blue. So it has one red and one blue so far, so the remaining four faces (back, left, top, bottom) must have one red and one blue, and two yellows? Wait, no, each color must have exactly two faces. So Cube 1 has front: red (1), right: blue (1). Therefore, it needs one more red and one more blue on the other faces. So the remaining four faces (back, left, top, bottom) must have one red, one blue, and two yellows. Wait, but that would make Cube 1 have three yellows, which is more than two. So that's not possible.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Each cube has exactly two faces of each color. So Cube 1 has two reds, two blues, and two yellows. So front is red, right is blue. So the remaining four faces (back, left, top, bottom) must include one red and one blue, and two yellows. But that would mean Cube 1 has three yellows, which is impossible because each color is only two. So I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the right view. Let me double-check.\n\nThe right view is from the right side, so for Cube 1 (leftmost), the right face is the face that's on the right side when looking from the front. So Cube 1's right face is blue. Cube 2's right face is red, and Cube 3's right face is yellow.\n\nSo, for Cube 1:\n\n- Front: red\n- Right: blue\n\nTherefore, the remaining faces (back, left, top, bottom) must have one red and one blue, and two yellows. But that's three yellows, which is not allowed. So perhaps my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nWait, no, each cube has exactly two faces of each color, so Cube 1 has two reds, two blues, and two yellows. So if front is red and right is blue, the other four faces must be one red, one blue, and two yellows. But that adds up to four faces, with two yellows. So that's okay because two yellows are allowed.\n\nWait, but the remaining four faces can't have two yellows and one red and one blue, because that would make Cube 1 have two reds, two blues, and two yellows. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo for Cube 1:\n\n- Front: red\n- Right: blue\n- Then, the back, left, top, and bottom faces must include one red, one blue, and two yellows.\n\nSimilarly for Cube 2:\n\n- Front: blue\n- Right: red\n\nSo, it has front: blue, right: red. Therefore, the remaining four faces must include one blue, one red, and two yellows.\n\nCube 3:\n\n- Front: yellow\n- Right: yellow\n\nSo, it has two yellows on front and right. Therefore, the remaining four faces must include two reds and two blues.\n\nNow, the question is, what is the top view? So, the top faces of each cube when viewed from above, left to right.\n\nSo, I need to figure out what color is on the top face of each cube.\n\nLet me try to reconstruct each cube's orientation.\n\nStarting with Cube 1:\n\n- Front: red\n- Right: blue\n- So, if I imagine Cube 1 on the table, front face is red (facing me), right face is blue (to my right). So the back face would be opposite the front, which would be the color opposite red. But since each cube has two of each color, the back face could be any color, but considering the other constraints.\n\nWait, but each cube has two of each color, so the back face of Cube 1 can't be red, because front is red and each cube only has two reds. So the back face must be either blue or yellow.\n\nSimilarly, the left face of Cube 1 is to the left of its front face. So if front is red and right is blue, then left could be any color, but considering the top view.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to use the right view. From the right, Cube 1's right face is blue, so when looking from the right, the right face is blue. So, if I'm looking from the right, the front of Cube 1 is its left face. Wait, no, when looking from the right, the front of the row is Cube 3, so Cube 1 is on the far left.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about the cube's orientation. Let me try to assign coordinates to each face.\n\nLet's define the front face as positive x, right face as positive y, and top face as positive z.\n\nSo, for Cube 1:\n\n- Front (x+): red\n- Right (y+): blue\n\nTherefore, the back face (x-): opposite of front, which is not red, so it must be either blue or yellow.\n\nThe left face (y-): opposite of right, which is not blue, so it must be either red or yellow.\n\nThe top face (z+): ?\n\nThe bottom face (z-): ?\n\nSimilarly, for Cube 2:\n\n- Front (x+): blue\n- Right (y+): red\n\nSo, back (x-): opposite of front, which is not blue, so it's either red or yellow.\n\nLeft (y-): opposite of right, which is not red, so it's either blue or yellow.\n\nTop (z+): ?\n\nBottom (z-): ?\n\nCube 3:\n\n- Front (x+): yellow\n- Right (y+): yellow\n\nSo, back (x-): opposite of front, which is not yellow, so it's either red or blue.\n\nLeft (y-): opposite of right, which is not yellow, so it's either red or blue.\n\nTop (z+): ?\n\nBottom (z-): ?\n\nNow, considering the right view, which shows the right faces of each cube from front to back: Cube 3 right is yellow, Cube 2 right is red, Cube 1 right is blue.\n\nSo, Cube 1's right face is blue, which we've established.\n\nCube 2's right face is red.\n\nCube 3's right face is yellow.\n\nNow, let's try to figure out the top faces.\n\nWe need to determine the top face of each cube, which will be visible when looking from above.\n\nTo do this, perhaps we can use the fact that the top face must be consistent with the cube's orientation.\n\nLet me try to figure out Cube 1's top face.\n\nCube 1 has front: red (x+), right: blue (y+). So, if we imagine looking at Cube 1 from the front, the front is red, and the right is blue. So the top face could be either above the front or above the right.\n\nBut since the cube is on the table, the top face is above the front and right.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to consider that the top face is perpendicular to the table.\n\nSo, for Cube 1, the top face is in the positive z direction.\n\nSo, the top face is determined by the orientation of the cube. Since the front is red and the right is blue, the cube is oriented such that red is front, blue is right, so the top could be either the face that's above red or above blue.\n\nBut I think we need to figure out which color is on top.\n\nWait, maybe we can use the fact that each cube has two faces of each color. So, for Cube 1, front is red, right is blue. So, the top and bottom, left and back must be the remaining colors.\n\nBut Cube 1 has two reds, two blues, and two yellows.\n\nSo, front: red, right: blue, so the remaining four faces (back, left, top, bottom) must consist of one red, one blue, and two yellows.\n\nWait, but that would mean the top face could be either red, blue, or yellow.\n\nSimilarly for Cube 2 and Cube 3.\n\nBut we need a consistent way to figure this out.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use the fact that when looking from the right, the right face of each cube is a certain color, which might help determine the orientation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the right face of Cube 1 is blue, so if I'm looking from the right, the right face is blue, which means that the cube is oriented such that blue is to the right.\n\nSimilarly, for Cube 2, the right face is red, so from the right, red is to the right.\n\nAnd for Cube 3, the right face is yellow.\n\nWait, but from the right view, the right face of Cube 3 is yellow, which is the front face of Cube 3. So, when looking from the right, Cube 3's front face is yellow.\n\nSimilarly, Cube 2's right face is red, which is its front face? No, Cube 2's front face is blue, so its right face is red, which is different.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about the cube's orientation in 3D space.\n\nLet me try to define the orientation of each cube.\n\nStarting with Cube 1:\n\n- Front: red (x+)\n- Right: blue (y+)\n\nSo, the cube is oriented so that red is front, blue is right, and the left would be the opposite of right, which is not blue, so it's either red or yellow.\n\nBut since Cube 1 has two reds, and front is red, the left face can't be red again because that would make three reds. So the left face must be yellow.\n\nWait, but Cube 1 has two yellows, so if left is yellow, then the back face must be the remaining color.\n\nSo, Cube 1:\n\n- Front: red (x+)\n- Right: blue (y+)\n- Left: yellow (y-)\n- Therefore, back face (x-) must be blue, because Cube 1 has two blues, and right is blue, so back must be the other blue.\n\nWait, but that would make Cube 1 have front: red, right: blue, back: blue, left: yellow.\n\nThen, the top and bottom faces would be the remaining colors.\n\nBut Cube 1 has two yellows, so left is yellow, so the top and bottom must include one more yellow and the remaining colors.\n\nWait, no, Cube 1 has two yellows. So left is yellow, so the top and bottom must be one yellow and one blue or red.\n\nWait, let's count:\n\nCube 1 has:\n\n- Front: red (1)\n- Right: blue (1)\n- Left: yellow (1)\n- Back: blue (2)\n- So, remaining faces: top and bottom must be red and yellow.\n\nBecause Cube 1 has two reds, one in front, so top or bottom must be red.\n\nAnd two yellows, one in left, so top or bottom must be yellow.\n\nSo, top could be red or yellow, and bottom would be the other.\n\nBut how do we determine which is which?\n\nSimilarly for Cube 2.\n\nLet me try Cube 2:\n\n- Front: blue (x+)\n- Right: red (y+)\n\nSo, front is blue, right is red.\n\nTherefore, the left face is the opposite of right, which is not red, so it's either blue or yellow.\n\nBut Cube 2 has two blues, so front is blue, left can't be blue again because that would make three blues. So left must be yellow.\n\nTherefore, Cube 2:\n\n- Front: blue (x+)\n- Right: red (y+)\n- Left: yellow (y-)\n- Back face (x-): must be red, because Cube 2 has two reds, one on right, so back is the other red.\n\nThen, the top and bottom faces must be the remaining colors.\n\nCube 2 has:\n\n- Front: blue (1)\n- Right: red (1)\n- Left: yellow (1)\n- Back: red (2)\n- So, remaining faces: top and bottom must be blue and yellow.\n\nBecause Cube 2 has two blues, one on front, so top or bottom must be blue.\n\nAnd two yellows, one on left, so top or bottom must be yellow.\n\nAgain, how to determine which is which.\n\nNow, Cube 3:\n\n- Front: yellow (x+)\n- Right: yellow (y+)\n\nSo, front and right are both yellow.\n\nTherefore, the back and left faces must be the remaining colors, which are red and blue.\n\nSince each cube has two of each color, Cube 3 has two yellows on front and right, so the remaining four faces (back, left, top, bottom) must be two reds and two blues.\n\nSo, back and left must be one red and one blue, but we don't know which is which yet.\n\nNow, considering the top view, which shows the top faces of each cube from left to right.\n\nSo, for Cube 1, top face could be red or yellow.\n\nFor Cube 2, top face could be blue or yellow.\n\nFor Cube 3, top face could be red, blue, or yellow, but since Cube 3 has front and right as yellow, the top could be either red or blue.\n\nBut we need to figure out a consistent arrangement.\n\nLet me try to assume that the top face of Cube 1 is yellow.\n\nSo, Cube 1:\n\n- Top: yellow\n- Bottom: red (since it has two reds, one in front, one in bottom)\n\nSimilarly, Cube 2:\n\nIf top face is blue, then bottom is yellow.\n\nCube 3:\n\nIf top face is red, then bottom is blue.\n\nAlternatively, Cube 3 could have top face blue, making bottom red.\n\nBut let's see if this works.\n\nSo, Cube 1:\n\n- Front: red\n- Right: blue\n- Left: yellow\n- Back: blue\n- Top: yellow\n- Bottom: red\n\nCube 2:\n\n- Front: blue\n- Right: red\n- Left: yellow\n- Back: red\n- Top: blue\n- Bottom: yellow\n\nCube 3:\n\n- Front: yellow\n- Right: yellow\n- Back: red (let's say)\n- Left: blue\n- Top: red\n- Bottom: blue\n\nWait, but Cube 3 has two reds and two blues in back, left, top, bottom.\n\nIf back is red, left is blue, top is red, bottom is blue, that works.\n\nNow, let's check if each cube has exactly two of each color.\n\nCube 1:\n\n- Red: front and bottom (2)\n- Blue: right and back (2)\n"

    "seed": 6,
    "solution": "Solve this problem step by step. End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: You have three identical cubes. Each face of each cube is painted either red, blue, or yellow, with exactly two faces of each color on each cube. The cubes are placed in a row on a table. Looking at the cubes from the front, you see the colors [red, blue, yellow] from left to right. Looking at the cubes from the right side, you see the colors [yellow, red, blue] from front to back. What colors would you see when looking at the cubes from the top, reading from left to right? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I've got this problem with three identical cubes. Each cube has six faces, and each face is painted either red, blue, or yellow. The key detail is that each cube has exactly two faces of each color. So, two red, two blue, and two yellow faces on each cube.\n\nThe cubes are placed in a row on a table. When looking at them from the front, the sequence of colors we see is red, blue, yellow from left to right. That means the front face of the first cube is red, the front face of the second is blue, and the front face of the third is yellow.\n\nFrom the right side, looking at the cubes from the right, we see yellow, red, blue from front to back. Hmm, that's a bit tricky. Let me think about how that works. So, if we're looking from the right, the rightmost cube's right face is yellow, the middle cube's right face is red, and the leftmost cube's right face is blue. Wait, no, actually, when looking from the right, the first cube we see is the rightmost one, right? So the rightmost cube's right face is yellow, the middle cube's right face is red, and the leftmost cube's right face is blue. So, the right faces are yellow, red, blue for the three cubes respectively.\n\nOur goal is to figure out what colors we would see when looking at the cubes from the top, reading from left to right. So, we need to determine the top faces of each cube in the order from left to right.\n\nFirst, let's visualize the setup. We have three cubes in a row: let's call them Cube A (leftmost), Cube B (middle), and Cube C (rightmost). From the front, Cube A shows red on its front face, Cube B shows blue, and Cube C shows yellow.\n\nFrom the right, Cube C's right face is yellow, Cube B's right face is red, and Cube A's right face is blue.\n\nEach cube has two of each color, so we need to make sure that the faces we've identified so far don't conflict with that.\n\nLet's start by noting down the front and right faces:\n\n- Cube A:\n  - Front: Red\n  - Right: Blue\n\n- Cube B:\n  - Front: Blue\n  - Right: Red\n\n- Cube C:\n  - Front: Yellow\n  - Right: Yellow\n\nWait, hold on. Cube C's front is yellow, and its right face is also yellow. But each cube has exactly two faces of each color. So, if Cube C's front and right faces are both yellow, that accounts for two yellow faces. That leaves the other four faces (top, bottom, left, back) to be split between red and blue, each having two faces.\n\nBut wait, Cube C's right face is yellow, which is its right face. So, from the front, we see front face as yellow, and from the right, we see the right face as yellow. So, that uses up two yellow faces for Cube C. Therefore, the top, bottom, left, and back faces must be red and blue, each with two faces.\n\nSimilarly, for Cube A:\n\n- Front: Red\n- Right: Blue\n\nSo, that's one red and one blue face. Since each cube has two of each color, the remaining faces (top, bottom, back, left) must have one red and one blue each.\n\nSame for Cube B:\n\n- Front: Blue\n- Right: Red\n\nSo, one blue and one red face. The remaining faces (top, bottom, left, back) must have one red and one blue each.\n\nNow, the challenge is to figure out the top faces. Let's try to deduce the top faces by considering the possible orientations.\n\nLet's start with Cube C, the rightmost cube.\n\nCube C:\n\n- Front: Yellow\n- Right: Yellow\n- So, the top, bottom, left, and back faces must be two red and two blue.\n\nLooking at Cube C from the front, the front face is yellow, so the top face could be either red or blue. Similarly, the left face could be red or blue.\n\nBut let's think about Cube B, the middle cube. From the right, Cube B's right face is red. So, the right face of Cube B is red. But Cube B's front face is blue.\n\nSo, Cube B's front is blue, right is red. Therefore, the top, bottom, left, and back faces must have one blue and one red each.\n\nSimilarly, for Cube A, front is red, right is blue. So, the top, bottom, left, and back must have one red and one blue each.\n\nLet me try to assign possible colors to the top faces.\n\nStarting with Cube C:\n\nCube C's front is yellow, right is yellow. So, the remaining faces (top, bottom, left, back) are two red and two blue.\n\nLet's consider the top face of Cube C. If Cube C's top face is red, then the bottom must be blue, and the left and back would have to be split between the remaining colors.\n\nBut let's think about Cube B. Cube B's right face is red. So, the right face of Cube B is red. That means when looking from the right, we see Cube C's right face (yellow), Cube B's right face (red), and Cube A's right face (blue).\n\nNow, considering Cube B's orientation: front is blue, right is red. So, from the front, it shows blue, and from the right, it shows red. So, the top face of Cube B could be either red or blue, but let's see.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think about the relative positions.\n\nLet me try to sketch a mental image.\n\nFrom the front:\n\nCube A: Front=Red, Right=Blue\n\nCube B: Front=Blue, Right=Red\n\nCube C: Front=Yellow, Right=Yellow\n\nSo, let's think about Cube A. Front=Red, Right=Blue. So, from the front, it's red; from the right, it's blue.\n\nTherefore, Cube A's top face can't be red because front is red. Wait, no, the top face is separate from the front and right. So, the front is red, right is blue, but the top could be either.\n\nWait, no, the front, right, back, and left are the four vertical faces. The top and bottom are the two horizontal faces.\n\nSo, each cube has six faces: front, back, left, right, top, bottom.\n\nEach cube has two of each color: red, blue, yellow.\n\nSo, for Cube A:\n\nFront=Red\n\nRight=Blue\n\nSo, that's one Red and one Blue face used.\n\nTherefore, the remaining four faces (Back, Left, Top, Bottom) must be one Red and one Blue each.\n\nSimilarly, Cube B:\n\nFront=Blue\n\nRight=Red\n\nSo, one Blue and one Red used.\n\nRemaining four faces (Back, Left, Top, Bottom) must be one Red and one Blue each.\n\nCube C:\n\nFront=Yellow\n\nRight=Yellow\n\nSo, two Yellow faces used.\n\nRemaining four faces (Back, Left, Top, Bottom) must be two Red and two Blue.\n\nNow, the key is to figure out the orientations so that the colors from the top, when viewed left to right, give the correct sequence.\n\nBut how? Let's think about the possible orientations.\n\nLet me try to assign the top faces.\n\nLet's start with Cube A.\n\nCube A:\n\nFront=Red\n\nRight=Blue\n\nSo, Front is Red, Right is Blue.\n\nTherefore, the Top and Bottom must be one Red and one Blue each, and the Back and Left must also be one Red and one Blue each.\n\nBut how are they oriented?\n\nLet me think about the standard way cubes are oriented. The front face is facing us, the right face is to the right, the left face is to the left, the back face is behind, the top face is up, and the bottom face is down.\n\nSo, if Cube A's Front is Red, Right is Blue, then the Back would be opposite to Front, so Back would be opposite color? Wait, no, the Back could be any color, but it has to comply with the two faces per color.\n\nWait, no, the Back face is just another face; it doesn't have to be opposite in color. It's just that each color has exactly two faces.\n\nSo, for Cube A, Front=Red, Right=Blue. Therefore, the Back, Left, Top, Bottom must include one Red and one Blue each.\n\nSimilarly for Cube B and Cube C.\n\nNow, let's think about Cube C.\n\nCube C:\n\nFront=Yellow\n\nRight=Yellow\n\nSo, Front and Right are Yellow.\n\nTherefore, the Back, Left, Top, Bottom must be two Red and two Blue.\n\nNow, let's consider the orientation of each cube.\n\nFrom the front, Cube A is Red, so the Front is Red. From the right, Cube A's Right is Blue. So, if we imagine looking at Cube A from the front, the Right face is Blue.\n\nSimilarly, for Cube B: Front is Blue, Right is Red.\n\nFor Cube C: Front is Yellow, Right is Yellow.\n\nNow, to figure out the top faces, let's think about how the cubes are arranged.\n\nSince they are placed in a row, the orientation of each cube's top face depends on their placement.\n\nBut without knowing the exact arrangement in height, it's a bit tricky. However, we can deduce based on the constraints.\n\nLet me try to think of the cubes as being placed on a table, each on top of the previous one? Or side by side on the table? The problem says \"placed in a row on a table,\" so probably side by side.\n\nBut when viewed from the top, the top face of each cube is visible.\n\nSo, from the top, we need to see the top faces of Cube A, Cube B, Cube C from left to right.\n\nBut to find that, we need to figure out what color is on top of each cube.\n\nLet me try to assign possible top colors.\n\nStarting with Cube A.\n\nCube A:\n\nFront=Red\n\nRight=Blue\n\nSo, Front=Red, Right=Blue.\n\nTherefore, the Back, Left, Top, Bottom must be one Red and one Blue each.\n\nLet's assume that the Back is opposite to the Front, but in terms of color, not necessarily. So, Front=Red, Back could be any color, but we have to have two of each color.\n\nSo, for Cube A:\n\nFaces:\n\nFront=Red\n\nRight=Blue\n\nBack=?\n\nLeft=?\n\nTop=?\n\nBottom=?\n\nColors used so far: Red (Front), Blue (Right). So, remaining colors for Back, Left, Top, Bottom: one Red and one Blue.\n\nSimilarly for Cube B:\n\nFront=Blue\n\nRight=Red\n\nSo, remaining colors: one Red and one Blue for Back, Left, Top, Bottom.\n\nCube C:\n\nFront=Yellow\n\nRight=Yellow\n\nSo, remaining colors: two Red and two Blue for Back, Left, Top, Bottom.\n\nNow, let's try to figure out the orientation of each cube.\n\nLet me consider Cube A.\n\nIf Cube A's Front is Red and Right is Blue, then the Back could be opposite to Front, but not necessarily. However, the Back face can't be Red because we only have two Reds, and Front is already Red. So, Back can't be Red because Front is Red, and each color has exactly two faces.\n\nWait, no, each color has exactly two faces on the entire cube. So, for Cube A, since Front is Red, Back can't be Red because that would make three Reds. Therefore, Back must be a different color.\n\nWait, that's an important point. Each cube has exactly two faces of each color. So, if Cube A's Front is Red, then Back cannot be Red because that would make two Reds on the vertical faces, but the Front and Back would both be Red, making two Reds. Wait, no, each color has exactly two faces on the entire cube. So, if Front is Red, Back can't be Red because that would make two Reds on the Back and Front, but each color has exactly two faces.\n\nWait, no, each color has exactly two faces on the entire cube. So, if Front is Red, Back can't be Red because that would make three Reds (Front, Back, and maybe another face). Wait, no, the cube has six faces, with two of each color. So, if Front is Red, Back can't be Red because that would make two Reds on the vertical faces, but the cube has two Reds total.\n\nWait, no, the cube has six faces, two of each color. So, if Front is Red, Back can't be Red because that would make two Reds on the vertical faces, but the cube has two Reds in total. So, Front=Red, Back\u2260Red.\n\nSimilarly, if Front is Red, then Back must be a different color, either Blue or Yellow.\n\nBut in this case, Cube A's Front is Red, Right is Blue.\n\nSo, Front=Red, Right=Blue.\n\nTherefore, the Back, Left, Top, Bottom must be one Red and one Blue each.\n\nBut since Front is Red, Back can't be Red. Therefore, Back must be Blue.\n\nSo, Back=Blue.\n\nThen, the remaining faces: Left, Top, Bottom must have one Red and one Blue each.\n\nWait, but we have four faces left: Left, Top, Bottom, and Back. We've assigned Back=Blue.\n\nSo, Front=Red, Right=Blue, Back=Blue.\n\nWait, that's two Blues on the vertical faces, but each cube can only have two of each color. So, Front=Red, Right=Blue, Back=Blue.\n\nThat would be two Blues on the vertical faces, which is allowed because each color has exactly two faces on the cube.\n\nTherefore, Cube A:\n\nFront=Red\n\nRight=Blue\n\nBack=Blue\n\nLeft=?\n\nTop=?\n\nBottom=?\n\nNow, the remaining faces: Left, Top, Bottom.\n\nWe have used two Reds (Front and Back=Blue? Wait, no, Front=Red, Back=Blue. So, Reds used: Front=Red. Blues used: Right=Blue, Back=Blue. So, Reds remaining: one (Top or Bottom). Blues remaining: none.\n\nWait, that can't be. Because each cube has two Reds and two Blues.\n\nWait, Front=Red, Right=Blue, Back=Blue.\n\nSo, Reds: Front=Red, so one Red used. Need one more Red on either Left, Top, or Bottom.\n\nBlues: Right=Blue, Back=Blue, so two Blues used. So, no more Blues can be used on Left, Top, or Bottom.\n\nTherefore, Left, Top, Bottom must be:\n\nLeft=Red\n\nTop=Blue? No, can't because Blues are already used up.\n\nWait, that can't be. Let me re-express.\n\nCube A:\n\nFaces:\n\nFront=Red\n\nRight=Blue\n\nBack=Blue\n\nLeft=?\n\nTop=?\n\nBottom=?\n\nColors used:\n\nRed: Front\n\nBlue: Right, Back\n\nYellow: None\n\nSo, remaining colors: Yellow must be on Left, Top, or Bottom. But each cube has two Yellow faces, but Cube A's Front, Right, Back are non-Yellow. So, Yellow must be on Left, Top, or Bottom.\n\nBut wait, each cube has two Yellow faces. So, if Cube A's Front, Right, Back are Red, Blue, Blue, then the Yellow faces must be on Left, Top, and Bottom? No, wait, each color has exactly two faces. So, if Yellow is on Left, Top, and Bottom, that's three Yellow faces, which is more than allowed.\n\nTherefore, my earlier assumption is wrong. Let's backtrack.\n\nCube A:\n\nFront=Red\n\nRight=Blue\n\nSo, Front=Red, Right=Blue.\n\nSince each color has two faces, and each cube has six faces, we have two Reds, two Blues, and two Yellows.\n\nSo, Front=Red, Right=Blue.\n\nTherefore, the remaining faces (Back, Left, Top, Bottom) must be one Red and one Blue each, but also considering the Yellows.\n\nWait, no, the Yellows are separate. Each cube has two Yellows, so two of the remaining four faces must be Yellow.\n\nSo, for Cube A:\n\nFront=Red\n\nRight=Blue\n\nSo, remaining faces: Back, Left, Top, Bottom.\n\nThese must include:\n\n- One Red (since two Reds in total, one used on Front)\n\n- One Blue (since two Blues in total, one used on Right)\n\n- Two Yellows.\n\nSo, the remaining four faces must be one Red, one Blue, and two Yellows.\n\nTherefore, Cube A:\n\nBack, Left, Top, Bottom: one Red, one Blue, two Yellows.\n\nSimilarly, for Cube B:\n\nFront=Blue\n\nRight=Red\n\nSo, remaining faces: Back, Left, Top, Bottom.\n\nMust include one Red, one Blue, and two Yellows.\n\nCube C:\n\nFront=Yellow\n\nRight=Yellow\n\nSo, remaining faces: Back, Left, Top, Bottom.\n\nMust include two Reds and two Blues.\n\nNow, let's try to figure out Cube A's Back, Left, Top, Bottom.\n\nWe have:\n\nCube A:\n\nFront=Red\n\nRight=Blue\n\nBack, Left, Top, Bottom: one Red, one Blue, two Yellows.\n\nSimilarly for Cube B.\n\nLet me try to assign the Back, Left, Top, Bottom for Cube A.\n\nLet's assume that Cube A's Back is Yellow.\n\nSo, Back=Yellow.\n\nThen, remaining faces: Left, Top, Bottom must be one Red, one Blue, and one Yellow.\n\nBut since each color has exactly two faces, and we've already used one Yellow on Back, we need one more Yellow on either Left, Top, or Bottom.\n\nSo, let's say Back=Yellow, Left=Yellow.\n\nThen, Top and Bottom must be one Red and one Blue.\n\nBut let's check:\n\nCube A:\n\nFront=Red\n\nRight=Blue\n\nBack=Yellow\n\nLeft=Yellow\n\nTop=?\n\nBottom=?\n\nSo, Top and Bottom must be Red and Blue.\n\nSo, let's say Top=Red, Bottom=Blue.\n\nTherefore, Cube A's faces:\n\nFront=Red\n\nRight=Blue\n\nBack=Yellow\n\nLeft=Yellow\n\nTop=Red\n\nBottom=Blue\n\nNow, let's check if this works.\n\nEach color:\n\nRed: Front, Top (two)\n\nBlue: Right, Bottom (two)\n\nYellow: Back, Left (two)\n\nPerfect.\n\nSo, Cube A's orientation is:\n\nFront=Red\n\nRight=Blue\n\nBack=Yellow\n\nLeft=Yellow\n\nTop=Red\n\nBottom=Blue\n\nNow, let's move to Cube B.\n\nCube B:\n\nFront=Blue\n\nRight=Red\n\nSo, Front=Blue, Right=Red.\n\nRemaining faces: Back, Left, Top, Bottom.\n\nMust include one Red, one Blue, and two Yellows.\n\nSo, similar to Cube A, let's assign Back=Yellow.\n\nThen, Left=Yellow.\n\nThen, Top and Bottom must be Red and Blue.\n\nSo, let's say Top=Red, Bottom=Blue.\n\nTherefore, Cube B's faces:\n\n"

    "solution": "Solve this problem step by step. End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: You have three identical cubes. Each face of each cube is painted either red, blue, or yellow, with exactly two faces of each color on each cube. The cubes are placed in a row on a table. Looking at the cubes from the front, you see the colors [red, blue, yellow] from left to right. Looking at the cubes from the right side, you see the colors [yellow, red, blue] from front to back. What colors would you see when looking at the cubes from the top, reading from left to right? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this problem here with three identical cubes. Each cube has exactly two faces painted red, two blue, and two yellow. They're placed in a row on a table. When viewed from the front, the colors are red, blue, yellow from left to right. From the right side, looking front to back, the colors are yellow, red, blue. I need to figure out what colors I'll see from the top, reading left to right.\n\nFirst, I should probably visualize the setup. There are three cubes in a row. Let me label them Cube 1, Cube 2, and Cube 3 from left to right. So, from the front view, Cube 1 is red, Cube 2 is blue, and Cube 3 is yellow.\n\nNow, each cube has two red, two blue, and two yellow faces. That means each cube has six faces, with exactly two of each color. So, for each cube, each color is used on two adjacent faces or opposite faces, but since they're cubes, opposite faces can't be adjacent.\n\nWait, but each cube is identical, so the arrangement of colors on each cube must be the same. Hmm, that's an important point. So, the way the colors are arranged on each cube is the same for all three cubes.\n\nLet me think about how the colors are arranged on a single cube. Since each cube has two red, two blue, and two yellow faces, and all cubes are identical, the arrangement must be consistent across all three.\n\nNow, looking at the front view, each cube shows a different color on their front face. So, Cube 1's front is red, Cube 2's front is blue, and Cube 3's front is yellow. That means from the front, each cube's front face is a different color.\n\nSimilarly, when viewed from the right, the colors are yellow, red, blue from front to back. So, the right face of Cube 1 (from the front) is yellow, the right face of Cube 2 is red, and the right face of Cube 3 is blue.\n\nWait, but when looking from the right, the front to back view would be the front face of the rightmost cube, then the front face of the middle cube, then the front face of the leftmost cube. Wait, no, actually, when looking from the right, the first cube you see is the rightmost one, so Cube 3's front face is yellow, then Cube 2's front face is red, and Cube 1's front face is blue. But the problem says the right view is yellow, red, blue from front to back, which would correspond to Cube 3, Cube 2, Cube 1.\n\nBut wait, the front view is Cube 1: red, Cube 2: blue, Cube 3: yellow.\n\nSo, from the front, Cube 1 is red (front face), Cube 2 is blue (front face), Cube 3 is yellow (front face).\n\nFrom the right, looking front to back, you see Cube 3's front face (yellow), Cube 2's front face (blue), and Cube 1's front face (red). But the problem states that from the right, the colors are yellow, red, blue. That matches Cube 3, Cube 2, Cube 1.\n\nWait, no, actually, when looking from the right, the order would be the rightmost cube's front face first, then the one to its left, etc. So, from the right, you see Cube 3's front face (yellow), then Cube 2's front face (blue), then Cube 1's front face (red). But the problem says the right view is yellow, red, blue. So that doesn't match. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, maybe when looking from the right, the front to back view is from the perspective of someone standing to the right of the row of cubes, looking back. So, the first cube they see is Cube 1, then Cube 2, then Cube 3. But the problem says from the right, it's yellow, red, blue front to back. So, that would mean Cube 1's right face is yellow, Cube 2's right face is red, and Cube 3's right face is blue.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense because each cube's right face is adjacent to the next cube. So, if Cube 1's right face is yellow, then Cube 2's left face is yellow. But Cube 2's front face is blue, so that's possible.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to sketch this.\n\nEach cube has front, back, left, right, top, and bottom faces.\n\nFrom the front view, Cube 1's front is red, Cube 2's front is blue, Cube 3's front is yellow.\n\nFrom the right view, looking front to back, the colors are yellow, red, blue. So, the rightmost cube (Cube 3) is showing its front face as yellow, then Cube 2's front face is red, and Cube 1's front face is blue. Wait, but that's the same as the front view. That can't be right because the front view is red, blue, yellow.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the right view. When looking from the right, the first cube you see is Cube 1, then Cube 2, then Cube 3. So, the order from front to back would be Cube 1's front face, Cube 2's front face, Cube 3's front face. But the problem says from the right, it's yellow, red, blue. So, that would mean Cube 1's front is yellow, Cube 2's front is red, Cube 3's front is blue. But that contradicts the front view which is red, blue, yellow.\n\nThis suggests that the front face of each cube is different from their right face. So, let's try to figure out the orientation of each cube.\n\nEach cube has front, back, left, right, top, and bottom. Since each cube is identical, the arrangement of colors is the same for each.\n\nLet me consider Cube 1 first. Its front face is red. Let's denote the front face as F, back as B, left as L, right as R, top as T, and bottom as Bot.\n\nSo, for Cube 1:\n\nF = red\n\nWe know that each cube has exactly two of each color. So, red, blue, yellow each have two faces.\n\nSo, for Cube 1, F is red, so one of the other faces must be red. Since each cube has two red faces, the other red face must be either L, R, T, or Bot.\n\nSimilarly, Cube 2's front is blue, so its F is blue, and the other blue face is either L, R, T, or Bot.\n\nCube 3's front is yellow, so F is yellow, and the other yellow face is either L, R, T, or Bot.\n\nNow, from the right view, looking front to back, the colors are yellow, red, blue. So, from the right, the first cube (Cube 1) is showing its R face as yellow, Cube 2's R face as red, and Cube 3's R face as blue.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, from the right view:\n\nCube 1's right face is yellow.\n\nCube 2's right face is red.\n\nCube 3's right face is blue.\n\nSo, for each cube:\n\nCube 1:\n\nF = red\n\nR = yellow\n\nSo, the other faces must be blue and yellow. Wait, no, each color has two faces. So, for Cube 1, F is red, R is yellow. So, the remaining colors are blue and yellow? Wait, no, because each cube has two of each color. So, Cube 1 has two red, two blue, and two yellow.\n\nSo, F is red, R is yellow. So, the remaining faces are L, B, T, Bot. We have two red, two blue, two yellow. So, Cube 1's F and R are red and yellow, so the remaining four faces must have one red, two blue, and one yellow? Wait, no, because each color has exactly two faces. So, Cube 1 has two red, two blue, two yellow.\n\nSo, F is red, R is yellow. Therefore, the other four faces (L, B, T, Bot) must include one red, two blue, and one yellow.\n\nBut wait, no, because F is red, R is yellow, so the remaining four faces (L, B, T, Bot) must include one red, two blue, and one yellow. Because each color has two faces.\n\nSo, for Cube 1:\n\nF = red\n\nR = yellow\n\nSo, among L, B, T, Bot, we have one red, two blue, and one yellow.\n\nSimilarly, for Cube 2:\n\nF = blue\n\nFrom the right view, R = red.\n\nSo, F = blue, R = red.\n\nThus, the remaining faces (L, B, T, Bot) must include one blue, two red, and one yellow.\n\nWait, no, because each cube has two of each color. So, Cube 2 has F=blue, R=red. So, the remaining four faces (L, B, T, Bot) must include one blue, two red, and one yellow.\n\nWait, but that's not possible because each color must have exactly two faces. So, Cube 2 has F=blue, R=red. So, the other four faces must include one blue, two red, and one yellow? That would give Cube 2 a total of two blue (F and one other), two red (R and one other), and one yellow. But that's not allowed because each color must have exactly two.\n\nWait, I must be making a mistake here. Let me think again.\n\nEach cube has exactly two faces of each color. So, for Cube 2, F=blue, so it has one more blue face among L, B, T, Bot. Similarly, R=red, so it has one more red face among L, B, T, Bot. The remaining two faces must be yellow.\n\nWait, no, because each color has two faces. So, Cube 2 has F=blue, R=red. Therefore, the remaining two faces must be yellow, because it already has one blue and one red, so it needs one more of each, and two yellows.\n\nWait, but that would mean Cube 2 has F=blue, R=red, and the other four faces must include one blue, one red, and two yellows.\n\nWait, but that's impossible because the remaining four faces can only accommodate four colors, but each color has only two faces in total.\n\nWait, no, each cube has six faces, with two of each color. So, for Cube 2, F=blue, R=red. So, the remaining four faces (L, B, T, Bot) must include one blue, one red, and two yellows.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, Cube 2 has:\n\nF=blue\n\nR=red\n\nAnd among L, B, T, Bot: one blue, one red, and two yellows.\n\nSimilarly, Cube 3:\n\nFrom the front view, F=yellow.\n\nFrom the right view, R=blue.\n\nSo, F=yellow, R=blue.\n\nThus, the remaining four faces (L, B, T, Bot) must include one yellow, one blue, and two reds.\n\nWait, but each color must have exactly two faces. So, Cube 3 has F=yellow, R=blue. Therefore, the remaining four faces must include one yellow, one blue, and two reds.\n\nYes, that works.\n\nSo, let's summarize:\n\nCube 1:\n\nF=red\n\nR=yellow\n\nSo, remaining faces (L, B, T, Bot) must include one red, two blue, and one yellow.\n\nCube 2:\n\nF=blue\n\nR=red\n\nRemaining faces (L, B, T, Bot) must include one blue, one red, and two yellows.\n\nCube 3:\n\nF=yellow\n\nR=blue\n\nRemaining faces (L, B, T, Bot) must include one yellow, one blue, and two reds.\n\nNow, I need to figure out the orientation of each cube so that when viewed from the top, the colors from left to right are the required ones.\n\nBut wait, the problem is asking for the top view, reading left to right. So, the top face of each cube, from Cube 1 to Cube 3, what colors would we see?\n\nTo find that, I need to determine the top face of each cube. Since the cubes are placed in a row, their top faces are all horizontal, but the orientation of each cube's top face relative to the row can vary.\n\nWait, but the problem doesn't specify whether the cubes are stacked vertically or placed side by side on the table. It says they're placed in a row on a table. So, they're likely placed side by side, each on their own, so their top faces are all in the same horizontal plane.\n\nWait, no, if they're placed in a row on a table, each cube is likely sitting on the table, so their bottom faces are on the table, and their top faces are facing upwards. So, from the top view, looking down, we see the top faces of each cube from left to right.\n\nSo, the top faces of Cube 1, Cube 2, Cube 3 from left to right.\n\nSo, I need to determine what colors are on the top faces of each cube.\n\nTo do that, I need to figure out the orientation of each cube, particularly which face is the top.\n\nBut since the cubes are placed on the table, their bottom face is on the table, so their top face is opposite their bottom face.\n\nBut without knowing the orientation, it's tricky. However, perhaps we can deduce the top faces based on the front and right views.\n\nLet me try to figure out the possible orientations.\n\nStarting with Cube 1:\n\nCube 1:\n\nF=red\n\nR=yellow\n\nSo, the front face is red, right face is yellow.\n\nThe remaining faces (L, B, T, Bot) must have one red, two blue, and one yellow.\n\nSimilarly, for Cube 2:\n\nF=blue\n\nR=red\n\nRemaining faces (L, B, T, Bot) must have one blue, one red, and two yellows.\n\nCube 3:\n\nF=yellow\n\nR=blue\n\nRemaining faces (L, B, T, Bot) must have one yellow, one blue, and two reds.\n\nNow, let's try to figure out the left and back faces for each cube.\n\nStarting with Cube 1:\n\nCube 1:\n\nF=red\n\nR=yellow\n\nSo, the remaining faces: L, B, T, Bot.\n\nWe have one red, two blue, one yellow.\n\nSo, possible arrangement:\n\nSuppose the left face is blue, then back face is blue, top is red, bottom is yellow.\n\nBut we need to make sure that the arrangement is consistent with the cube being a cube, so opposite faces are opposite.\n\nWait, but without knowing the exact arrangement, it's tricky. Maybe I can assume that for Cube 1, the left face is blue, back face is blue, top is red, and bottom is yellow.\n\nBut that would make Cube 1 have F=red, R=yellow, L=blue, B=blue, T=red, Bot=yellow.\n\nWait, but each color can only have two faces. So, red has F and T, which is two. Blue has L and B, which is two. Yellow has R and Bot, which is two. That works.\n\nSo, Cube 1's top face is red.\n\nSimilarly, for Cube 2:\n\nF=blue\n\nR=red\n\nRemaining faces: L, B, T, Bot must have one blue, one red, two yellows.\n\nSo, possible arrangement:\n\nLet me suppose that L=yellow, B=yellow, T=blue, Bot=red.\n\nSo, Cube 2:\n\nF=blue\n\nR=red\n\nL=yellow\n\nB=yellow\n\nT=blue\n\nBot=red\n\nBut then, blue has F and T, which is two. Red has R and Bot, which is two. Yellow has L and B, which is two. That works.\n\nSo, Cube 2's top face is blue.\n\nSimilarly, for Cube 3:\n\nF=yellow\n\nR=blue\n\nRemaining faces: L, B, T, Bot must have one yellow, one blue, two reds.\n\nSo, possible arrangement:\n\nSuppose L=red, B=red, T=yellow, Bot=blue.\n\nThus, Cube 3:\n\nF=yellow\n\nR=blue\n\nL=red\n\nB=red\n\nT=yellow\n\nBot=blue\n\nSo, yellow has F and T, two. Blue has R and Bot, two. Red has L and B, two. That works.\n\nSo, Cube 3's top face is yellow.\n\nTherefore, from the top view, left to right, we have Cube 1's top face (red), Cube 2's top face (blue), Cube 3's top face (yellow). So, the colors would be red, blue, yellow.\n\nWait, but that's the same as the front view. That seems a bit too coincidental. Let me check if this is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the top faces are arranged differently.\n\nWait, but based on the cube orientations I assumed, that's the case.\n\nBut let me think again. If Cube 1 has F=red, R=yellow, and I assumed L=blue, B=blue, T=red, Bot=yellow.\n\nCube 2 has F=blue, R=red, and I assumed L=yellow, B=yellow, T=blue, Bot=red.\n\nCube 3 has F=yellow, R=blue, and I assumed L=red, B=red, T=yellow, Bot=blue.\n\nSo, top faces: Cube1=red, Cube2=blue, Cube3=yellow.\n\nThus, from the top, reading left to right: red, blue, yellow.\n\nBut wait, that's the same as the front view. Is that possible? It seems so, but let me check if there's another possible arrangement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the top faces are arranged differently.\n\nWait, perhaps for Cube 1, the top face is blue, and the bottom is yellow.\n\nBut no, because Cube 1's R=yellow, so if T=blue, then Bot would be the opposite of T, which would be yellow. But then, yellow would have R and Bot, which is two. So, that works.\n\nSimilarly, Cube 2: if T=red, then Bot=blue, but then red would have R=red and T=red, which is two. But then, Cube 2's F=blue, R=red, L=yellow, B=yellow, T=red, Bot=blue. So, that's possible.\n\nWait, but then Cube 2's top face is red, which would make the top view different.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to clarify.\n\nEach cube"

    "solution": "Solve this problem step by step. End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: You have three identical cubes. Each face of each cube is painted either red, blue, or yellow, with exactly two faces of each color on each cube. The cubes are placed in a row on a table. Looking at the cubes from the front, you see the colors [red, blue, yellow] from left to right. Looking at the cubes from the right side, you see the colors [yellow, red, blue] from front to back. What colors would you see when looking at the cubes from the top, reading from left to right? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I've got this problem about three identical cubes, each painted with red, blue, and yellow. Each cube has exactly two faces of each color. They\u2019re placed in a row, and from the front, I see red, blue, yellow from left to right. From the right side, looking at them front to back, I see yellow, red, blue. I need to figure out what colors I'll see from the top, reading left to right.\n\nFirst, let me try to visualize each cube. Each cube has six faces, and each color (red, blue, yellow) appears exactly twice. So, each color has two faces on each cube.\n\nStarting with the front view: the first cube has a red face facing me, the second has blue, and the third has yellow. So, front face of cube 1 is red, cube 2 is blue, cube 3 is yellow.\n\nFrom the right side, looking at them front to back, I see yellow, red, blue. So, cube 1 (on the left) is being viewed from the right, which means the right face of cube 1 is yellow. Cube 2's right face is red, and cube 3's right face is blue.\n\nLet me denote each cube's front, right, back, left, top, and bottom faces.\n\nLet\u2019s name the cubes as Cube A, Cube B, Cube C from left to right.\n\nFrom front view:\n- Cube A's front face: red\n- Cube B's front face: blue\n- Cube C's front face: yellow\n\nFrom right view:\n- Cube A's right face: yellow\n- Cube B's right face: red\n- Cube C's right face: blue\n\nNow, each cube has exactly two faces of each color. So, for Cube A, front is red, right is yellow. Therefore, the remaining four faces (back, left, top, bottom) must include one red and one blue each, since each color is used exactly twice on the cube.\n\nWait, but Cube A already has front (red) and right (yellow). So, it needs another red and another blue on the remaining faces. Similarly, Cube B has front (blue) and right (red). So, it needs another blue and another yellow. Cube C has front (yellow) and right (blue). So, it needs another yellow and another red.\n\nLet me try to assign the colors for each cube.\n\nStarting with Cube A:\n- Front: red\n- Right: yellow\nSo, remaining faces: back, left, top, bottom.\nWe need one red and one blue. Let's say back is blue and left is red. But wait, that might not work because from the right view, Cube A's right face is yellow, but if the left face is red, that might affect the top view. Alternatively, maybe back is red and left is blue.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think systematically.\n\nEach cube has front, back, left, right, top, bottom.\n\nEach color is used exactly twice on each cube.\n\nFor Cube A:\n- Front: red\n- Right: yellow\nTherefore, the other four faces (back, left, top, bottom) must include one red and one blue each.\n\nSo, let's say back is blue, left is red, top is blue, bottom is red. But that would make two blues on the back and top, and two reds on left and bottom. That works because each color is used twice.\n\nBut let's see if that affects the other cubes.\n\nCube B:\n- Front: blue\n- Right: red\nSo, the other four faces need one blue and one yellow each.\n\nIf Cube B's front is blue and right is red, then back could be yellow, left could be blue, top could be yellow, bottom could be red. But wait, that would give Cube B's left as blue and back as yellow. But then, from the top view, the left face of Cube B would be blue, and the back face of Cube B would be yellow.\n\nCube C:\n- Front: yellow\n- Right: blue\nSo, the other four faces need one yellow and one red each.\n\nIf Cube C's front is yellow and right is blue, then back could be red, left could be yellow, top could be red, bottom could be blue. But that would give Cube C's left as yellow and back as red.\n\nNow, let's consider the top view. From the top, we look at the top faces of each cube.\n\nCube A's top face: blue (from earlier assignment)\nCube B's top face: yellow\nCube C's top face: red\n\nSo, from the top, left to right, it would be blue, yellow, red.\n\nWait, but let me double-check.\n\nCube A's top: blue\nCube B's top: yellow\nCube C's top: red\n\nYes, that seems to fit.\n\nBut let me make sure that each cube has exactly two of each color.\n\nCube A:\n- Front: red\n- Right: yellow\n- Back: blue\n- Left: red\n- Top: blue\n- Bottom: red\n\nWait, that's three reds (front, left, bottom) and two blues (back, top). That's not correct because each color should have exactly two faces. So, that's a problem.\n\nAh, I see, I made a mistake. Each cube must have exactly two of each color. So, Cube A can't have three reds.\n\nLet me try again.\n\nCube A:\n- Front: red\n- Right: yellow\nSo, remaining four faces: back, left, top, bottom.\n\nWe need one more red and one more blue.\n\nSo, let's say back is blue, left is red, top is blue, bottom is red. But that gives two blues (back, top) and two reds (front, left, bottom). Wait, no, front is red, left is red, bottom is red\u2014that's three reds. That's not allowed.\n\nSo, perhaps back is red, left is blue, top is red, bottom is blue. But then front is red, back is red\u2014two reds, left is blue, top is red\u2014wait, that's three reds again.\n\nHmm, this is tricky.\n\nMaybe Cube A's back is red, left is blue, top is yellow, bottom is blue. But then Cube A's front is red, right is yellow, back is red, left is blue, top is yellow, bottom is blue. That gives two reds (front, back), two blues (left, bottom), and two yellows (right, top). Yes, that works.\n\nSo, Cube A:\n- Front: red\n- Right: yellow\n- Back: red\n- Left: blue\n- Top: yellow\n- Bottom: blue\n\nCube B:\n- Front: blue\n- Right: red\nSo, remaining four faces: back, left, top, bottom.\n\nNeed one more blue and one more yellow.\n\nIf Cube B's back is yellow, left is blue, top is yellow, bottom is blue.\n\nSo, Cube B:\n- Front: blue\n- Right: red\n- Back: yellow\n- Left: blue\n- Top: yellow\n- Bottom: blue\n\nWait, that's three blues (front, left, bottom) and two yellows (back, top). But each color should have exactly two faces. So, that's a problem because Cube B would have three blues.\n\nWait, no, Cube B has front: blue, left: blue, bottom: blue\u2014three blues. That's not allowed. So, that's incorrect.\n\nAlternative approach: Cube B needs two blues and two yellows. It already has front: blue, right: red. So, the remaining four faces (back, left, top, bottom) need one more blue and one more yellow.\n\nWait, no. Each cube has exactly two of each color. So, Cube B has front: blue, so it needs one more blue. It also has right: red, so it needs one more red. Wait, no, each color must have exactly two faces on each cube. So, Cube B has front: blue, so it needs one more blue. It also has right: red, so it needs one more red.\n\nBut the problem is that from the right view, Cube B's right face is red, which is already accounted for. So, the remaining four faces (back, left, top, bottom) must include one blue and one yellow each.\n\nSo, let's assign:\n\nCube B:\n- Front: blue\n- Right: red\n- Back: yellow\n- Left: blue\n- Top: yellow\n- Bottom: red\n\nBut then Cube B has front: blue, left: blue\u2014two blues, back: yellow, top: yellow\u2014two yellows, right: red, bottom: red\u2014two reds. Yes, that works.\n\nSo, Cube B:\n- Front: blue\n- Right: red\n- Back: yellow\n- Left: blue\n- Top: yellow\n- Bottom: red\n\nNow, Cube C:\n- Front: yellow\n- Right: blue\nSo, remaining four faces: back, left, top, bottom.\n\nNeed one more yellow and one more red.\n\nSo, back: red, left: yellow, top: red, bottom: yellow.\n\nThus, Cube C:\n- Front: yellow\n- Right: blue\n- Back: red\n- Left: yellow\n- Top: red\n- Bottom: yellow\n\nNow, let's check each cube:\n\nCube A:\n- Front: red\n- Right: yellow\n- Back: red\n- Left: blue\n- Top: yellow\n- Bottom: blue\n\nColors: two reds, two blues, two yellows. Correct.\n\nCube B:\n- Front: blue\n- Right: red\n- Back: yellow\n- Left: blue\n- Top: yellow\n- Bottom: red\n\nColors: two blues, two reds, two yellows. Correct.\n\nCube C:\n- Front: yellow\n- Right: blue\n- Back: red\n- Left: yellow\n- Top: red\n- Bottom: yellow\n\nColors: two yellows, two reds, two blues. Correct.\n\nNow, let's verify the right view.\n\nFrom the right, looking front to back:\n\nCube A's right face: yellow\nCube B's right face: red\nCube C's right face: blue\n\nYes, that matches the given right view: yellow, red, blue.\n\nNow, let's check the top view.\n\nFrom the top, looking at the top faces of each cube.\n\nCube A's top: yellow\nCube B's top: yellow\nCube C's top: red\n\nWait, that can't be right because the top faces are:\n\nCube A: top is yellow\nCube B: top is yellow\nCube C: top is red\n\nSo, from the top, left to right: yellow, yellow, red.\n\nBut that seems odd because the problem says from the front, it's red, blue, yellow, and from the right, it's yellow, red, blue. So, maybe that's correct, but let me double-check.\n\nWait, according to my assignments:\n\nCube A's top: yellow\nCube B's top: yellow\nCube C's top: red\n\nSo, from the top, it would be yellow, yellow, red.\n\nBut the problem might be expecting a different arrangement. Let me see if I can find another configuration.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Cube A's top is blue, Cube B's top is red, Cube C's top is blue. Let me see if that works.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nCube A:\n- Front: red\n- Right: yellow\nSo, remaining faces: back, left, top, bottom. Need one red and one blue.\n\nIf back is blue, left is red, top is blue, bottom is red.\n\nBut as before, that would give Cube A three reds (front, left, bottom). So, that's not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, back is red, left is blue, top is blue, bottom is red.\n\nCube A:\n- Front: red\n- Right: yellow\n- Back: red\n- Left: blue\n- Top: blue\n- Bottom: red\n\nWait, that's two reds (front, back, bottom) which is three. Not allowed.\n\nHmm, perhaps Cube A's top is red, bottom is blue, back is blue, left is red.\n\nCube A:\n- Front: red\n- Right: yellow\n- Back: blue\n- Left: red\n- Top: red\n- Bottom: blue\n\nBut that's three reds again. Not allowed.\n\nWait, maybe Cube A's top is blue, bottom is red, back is red, left is blue.\n\nCube A:\n- Front: red\n- Right: yellow\n- Back: red\n- Left: blue\n- Top: blue\n- Bottom: red\n\nAgain, three reds. Not allowed.\n\nThis seems tricky. Maybe I need to adjust Cube B and Cube C accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, let's try assigning Cube A's top as blue, and see how that affects the others.\n\nCube A:\n- Front: red\n- Right: yellow\n- Back: blue\n- Left: blue\n- Top: blue\n- Bottom: red\n\nWait, that's two blues (back, left, top) and two reds (front, bottom). But front is red, left is blue, back is blue, top is blue, bottom is red. So, Cube A has three blues. Not allowed.\n\nThis is frustrating. Maybe I need to approach it differently.\n\nLet me consider that from the top, the colors I see must be the top faces of each cube. So, I need to determine what each cube's top face is.\n\nGiven that each cube has exactly two of each color, and considering the front and right views, perhaps I can deduce the top faces.\n\nLet me try to outline the possible faces for each cube.\n\nCube A:\n- Front: red\n- Right: yellow\nSo, remaining faces: back, left, top, bottom. Need one red and one blue.\n\nLet\u2019s suppose Cube A's back is blue, left is red, top is blue, bottom is red.\n\nBut as before, that gives Cube A three reds. So, that's not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, Cube A's back is red, left is blue, top is blue, bottom is red.\n\nAgain, Cube A would have two reds (front, back, bottom) which is three. Not allowed.\n\nWait, maybe Cube A's top is yellow, bottom is blue, back is blue, left is red.\n\nCube A:\n- Front: red\n- Right: yellow\n- Back: blue\n- Left: red\n- Top: yellow\n- Bottom: blue\n\nThat gives Cube A two reds (front, left), two blues (back, bottom), and two yellows (right, top). Yes, that works.\n\nSo, Cube A:\n- Front: red\n- Right: yellow\n- Back: blue\n- Left: red\n- Top: yellow\n- Bottom: blue\n\nCube B:\n- Front: blue\n- Right: red\nSo, remaining faces: back, left, top, bottom. Need one blue and one yellow.\n\nIf Cube B's back is yellow, left is blue, top is yellow, bottom is blue.\n\nCube B:\n- Front: blue\n- Right: red\n- Back: yellow\n- Left: blue\n- Top: yellow\n- Bottom: blue\n\nBut that gives Cube B three blues (front, left, bottom) and two yellows (back, top). That's not allowed because each color must have exactly two faces.\n\nSo, let's adjust Cube B.\n\nCube B:\n- Front: blue\n- Right: red\n- Back: blue\n- Left: yellow\n- Top: yellow\n- Bottom: red\n\nWait, Cube B would have front: blue, back: blue\u2014two blues, left: yellow, top: yellow\u2014two yellows, right: red, bottom: red\u2014two reds. Yes, that works.\n\nSo, Cube B:\n- Front: blue\n- Right: red\n- Back: blue\n- Left: yellow\n- Top: yellow\n- Bottom: red\n\nCube C:\n- Front: yellow\n- Right: blue\nSo, remaining faces: back, left, top, bottom. Need one yellow and one red.\n\nIf Cube C's back is red, left is yellow, top is red, bottom is yellow.\n\nCube C:\n- Front: yellow\n- Right: blue\n- Back: red\n- Left: yellow\n- Top: red\n- Bottom: yellow\n\nNow, check each cube:\n\nCube A:\n- Front: red\n- Right: yellow\n- Back: blue\n- Left: red\n- Top: yellow\n- Bottom: blue\n\nColors: two reds, two blues, two yellows. Correct.\n\nCube B:\n- Front: blue\n- Right: red\n- Back: blue\n- Left: yellow\n- Top: yellow\n- Bottom: red\n\nColors: two blues, two reds, two yellows. Correct.\n\nCube C:\n- Front: yellow\n- Right: blue\n- Back: red\n- Left: yellow\n- Top: red\n- Bottom: yellow\n\nColors: two yellows, two reds, two blues. Correct.\n\nNow, let's verify the right view.\n\nFrom the right, looking front to back:\n\nCube A's right face: yellow\nCube B's right face: red\nCube C's right face: blue\n\nYes, that matches the given right view: yellow, red, blue.\n\nNow, let's check the top view.\n\nFrom the top, looking at the top faces:\n\nCube A's top: yellow\nCube B's top: yellow\nCube C's top: red\n\nSo, from the top, left to right: yellow, yellow, red.\n\nBut that seems to be the result, but let me see if there's another configuration.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Cube C's top is blue, but I don't see how that would work.\n\nWait, in Cube C's current configuration, top is red because back is red, left is yellow, top is red.\n\nAlternatively, could Cube C's top be blue?\n\nLet me try adjusting Cube C.\n\nIf Cube C's top is blue, then perhaps:\n\nCube C:\n- Front: yellow\n- Right: blue\n- Back: red\n- Left: yellow\n- Top: blue\n- Bottom: red\n\nBut that would give Cube C two yellows (front, left, top) which is three. Not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, Cube C's top is blue, back is blue, left is red, top is blue.\n\nCube C:\n- Front: yellow\n- Right: blue\n- Back: blue\n- Left: red\n- Top: blue\n- Bottom: red\n\nBut that gives Cube C three blues (back, top, front is yellow, right is blue, left is red, bottom is red). So, two blues, two reds, and two yellows? Wait, no. Front is yellow, right is blue, back is blue, left is red, top is blue, bottom is red. So, blues: back, right, top\u2014three blues. Not allowed.\n\nHmm, so perhaps the top view must be yellow, yellow, red.\n\nBut let me confirm.\n\nFrom the top:\n\nCube A's top: yellow\nCube B's top: yellow\nCube C's top: red\n\nYes, that's the only way it"

    "solution": "Solve this problem step by step. End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: You have three identical cubes. Each face of each cube is painted either red, blue, or yellow, with exactly two faces of each color on each cube. The cubes are placed in a row on a table. Looking at the cubes from the front, you see the colors [red, blue, yellow] from left to right. Looking at the cubes from the right side, you see the colors [yellow, red, blue] from front to back. What colors would you see when looking at the cubes from the top, reading from left to right? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this problem about three identical cubes, each painted with exactly two faces of each color: red, blue, and yellow. The cubes are placed in a row, and from the front, they look like red, blue, yellow from left to right. From the right side, they look like yellow, red, blue from front to back. I need to figure out what colors I would see from the top, reading left to right.\n\nFirst, I need to visualize the cubes. Each cube has six faces: front, back, left, right, top, and bottom. Since each color appears exactly two times on each cube, each color is used twice across all six faces. So, for each cube, two faces are red, two are blue, and two are yellow.\n\nGiven that, I can start by labeling the cubes. Let's call them Cube 1, Cube 2, and Cube 3 from left to right. From the front view, Cube 1's front face is red, Cube 2's front face is blue, and Cube 3's front face is yellow.\n\nNow, from the right side, the view is yellow, red, blue from front to back. That means, looking at Cube 3 from the right side (which is the rightmost cube), the front face is yellow, and the right face is red. Similarly, looking at Cube 2 from the right side, the front face is blue, and the right face is yellow. Wait, no, that might not be accurate. Let me think again.\n\nWhen looking at the cubes from the right side, the colors are yellow, red, blue from front to back. So, the front cube (Cube 3) from the right side shows yellow, then Cube 2 shows red, and Cube 1 shows blue. So, for Cube 3, its right face is yellow, and its back face (since we're looking from the right, the front face is yellow, and the back face is opposite to the front). Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me try to break it down step by step.\n\n1. Front View: Cube 1 (left) is red, Cube 2 is blue, Cube 3 is yellow.\n2. Right View: From the right, we see Cube 3's front face as yellow, Cube 2's front face as red, and Cube 1's front face as blue.\n\nBut wait, from the right side, the front face of Cube 3 is yellow, so its back face is the opposite. Similarly, Cube 2's front face from the right is red, so its back face is blue, and Cube 1's front face from the right is blue, so its back face is red.\n\nWait, no. When looking from the right, each cube's front face is the face that is closest to the viewer. So for Cube 3 (the rightmost cube), its front face is yellow, so its right face is the one facing away from the viewer, which is the opposite face. But each cube has front, back, left, right, top, and bottom. So, if the front is yellow, the back is opposite. Similarly, if the right face is something, it's fixed.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider each cube's orientation. Let me assign variables to each face.\n\nLet's denote each cube's faces as follows:\n\n- Front (F)\n- Back (B)\n- Left (L)\n- Right (R)\n- Top (T)\n- Bottom (Bot)\n\nEach cube has two faces of each color: R, B, Y.\n\nGiven that, from the front view:\n\n- Cube 1: F = R\n- Cube 2: F = B\n- Cube 3: F = Y\n\nFrom the right view:\n\n- When looking from the right, the first cube we see is Cube 3, then Cube 2, then Cube 1.\n\nWait, no. When looking from the right, the rightmost cube is Cube 3, and as we look from the right, we see Cube 3's front face first, then Cube 2's front face, then Cube 1's front face.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. When you look at a row of objects from the right, the rightmost object is the one closest to you, so you see its front face first, then the next one, etc.\n\nSo, from the right, the order is Cube 3, Cube 2, Cube 1.\n\nSo, the colors seen from the right are:\n\n- Cube 3's front face: Y\n- Cube 2's front face: R\n- Cube 1's front face: B\n\nTherefore, for Cube 3:\n\n- Front (F) = Y\n\nFor Cube 2:\n\n- Front (F) = R\n\nFor Cube 1:\n\n- Front (F) = B\n\nBut wait, that contradicts the front view, where Cube 1's front is R, Cube 2's front is B, and Cube 3's front is Y. So from the right, Cube 3's front is Y, Cube 2's front is R, and Cube 1's front is B.\n\nSo, the front faces are consistent with the front view.\n\nNow, from the right view, the front face of Cube 3 is Y, so the back face of Cube 3 is opposite. Since each cube has two Y faces, one is front (Y), the other is back (Y opposite). Wait, but each color has exactly two faces, so if Cube 3's front is Y, its back must also be Y, but that would mean four Y faces, which is not allowed. Wait, no, each cube has exactly two of each color. So, for each cube, two Y, two R, two B.\n\nTherefore, if Cube 3's front is Y, then its back must be a different color, but it can't be Y again. Wait, no, because each color has exactly two faces. So, if Cube 3's front is Y, then its back must also be Y? But that would mean four Y faces, which is impossible since each cube has only two Y faces. Therefore, I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, each cube has exactly two faces of each color, so for each color, two faces. So, if Cube 3's front is Y, then its back cannot be Y; it must be another color, say B or R. But then, how does that affect the right view?\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try again.\n\nEach cube has two R, two B, and two Y faces.\n\nFrom the front view:\n\n- Cube 1: Front = R\n- Cube 2: Front = B\n- Cube 3: Front = Y\n\nFrom the right view:\n\n- Cube 3's front face (from the right) is Y\n- Cube 2's front face (from the right) is R\n- Cube 1's front face (from the right) is B\n\nBut wait, Cube 1's front face from the front view is R, and from the right view, it's B. That suggests that Cube 1's front face is R when viewed from the front, but when viewed from the right, it's B. That can't be, because the front face of Cube 1 is R, and its right face is adjacent.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the orientation of each cube. Each cube can be rotated, so the front face is R, but the right face could be any color, depending on the cube's rotation.\n\nWait, but the problem says the cubes are placed in a row on a table. So, they are likely all oriented in the same way, but maybe not. Alternatively, each cube could be rotated differently.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should draw it out.\n\nLet me try to assign the front faces first.\n\nFront faces:\n\n- Cube 1: Front = R\n- Cube 2: Front = B\n- Cube 3: Front = Y\n\nNow, from the right view, looking at Cube 3 first (the rightmost cube), we see Y as its front face. So, Cube 3's front face is Y, as seen from the right. But in the front view, Cube 3's front face is Y. That suggests that Cube 3 is oriented the same way as viewed from the front and the right. Therefore, Cube 3's front face is Y, and its right face is some color.\n\nBut each cube has two Y faces. So, if Cube 3's front is Y, its back must be another color, but since each cube has exactly two Y faces, the back cannot be Y. So, Cube 3's front is Y, and its back is, say, B or R.\n\nSimilarly, Cube 2's front face from the front view is B, but from the right view, its front face is R. So, Cube 2's front face is B from the front, but when viewed from the right, it's R. That suggests that Cube 2 is rotated such that its right face is R when viewed from the right.\n\nSimilarly, Cube 1's front face is R from the front, but from the right view, it's B. So, Cube 1's front face is R, but when viewed from the right, its front face is B, meaning its right face is B.\n\nWait, that's confusing. Let me try to assign the right faces.\n\nFrom the right view:\n\n- Cube 3's front face is Y, so its right face is the opposite of its back face. Since front is Y, the back is another color, say B or R.\n\nBut each cube has two Y faces. So, Cube 3's front is Y, and its back must be another color. Let's say Cube 3's back is B. Then, Cube 3's right face would be opposite to its left face.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to assign all faces step by step.\n\nLet me consider each cube separately.\n\nCube 1:\n\n- Front (F1) = R\n- Back (B1) = ?\n- Left (L1) = ?\n- Right (R1) = ?\n- Top (T1) = ?\n- Bottom (Bot1) = ?\n\nCube 2:\n\n- Front (F2) = B\n- Back (B2) = ?\n- Left (L2) = ?\n- Right (R2) = ?\n- Top (T2) = ?\n- Bottom (Bot2) = ?\n\nCube 3:\n\n- Front (F3) = Y\n- Back (B3) = ?\n- Left (L3) = ?\n- Right (R3) = ?\n- Top (T3) = ?\n- Bottom (Bot3) = ?\n\nFrom the right view, we see:\n\n- Cube 3's front face is Y\n- Cube 2's front face is R\n- Cube 1's front face is B\n\nSo, for Cube 3:\n\n- F3 = Y (from front view)\n- From right view, F3 = Y (same as front view), so its right face R3 is the face opposite to its left face.\n\nBut I need to figure out the colors of the right faces.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the fact that each cube has exactly two of each color.\n\nSo, for each cube, two R, two B, two Y.\n\nStarting with Cube 3:\n\n- F3 = Y\n- So, Y is used once. It needs another Y face.\n\nSince each cube has two Y faces, the other Y face must be on the opposite side of Y. So, if F3 is Y, then B3 must be Y? But wait, that would mean two Y faces on Cube 3, which is allowed, but then the back face is Y.\n\nWait, but that would mean when looking from the right, the back face is Y, but we see the front face as Y. So, that's possible.\n\nBut let's check Cube 3.\n\nCube 3:\n\n- F3 = Y\n- B3 = Y (since two Y faces)\n- So, Y is done for Cube 3.\n\nNow, the remaining faces: L3, R3, T3, Bot3 must be R and B, each exactly two.\n\nSince Cube 3 has two R and two B left.\n\nSimilarly for Cube 2:\n\n- F2 = B\n- So, B is used once. It needs another B face.\n\nSo, B2 = B? But then, front and back are both B, which is allowed because each cube has two B faces.\n\nWait, but if Cube 2's front is B, and back is B, then its front and back are both B, which is allowed.\n\nSimilarly, Cube 1:\n\n- F1 = R\n- So, R is used once. It needs another R face.\n\nSo, R1 = R, but that would mean front and right are both R? Wait, no, because if Cube 1's front is R, and its right face is R, that would mean two R faces on Cube 1, which is allowed.\n\nBut let's proceed step by step.\n\nCube 3:\n\n- F3 = Y\n- B3 = Y\n- Now, L3, R3, T3, Bot3 must be R and B, each two.\n\nSo, let's assign L3 and R3 to be R and B.\n\nSimilarly, Cube 2:\n\n- F2 = B\n- B2 = B\n- L2, R2, T2, Bot2 must be R and Y, but wait, Y is already used on Cube 3.\n\nWait, no, each cube has its own colors. Each cube has two R, two B, two Y.\n\nSo, for Cube 2:\n\n- F2 = B\n- B2 = B\n- So, two B faces used.\n\nRemaining faces: L2, R2, T2, Bot2 must be R and Y, each two.\n\nSimilarly, Cube 1:\n\n- F1 = R\n- R1 = R\n- So, two R faces used.\n\nRemaining faces: L1, B1, T1, Bot1 must be B and Y, each two.\n\nNow, going back to the right view.\n\nFrom the right, we see:\n\n- Cube 3's front face is Y\n- Cube 2's front face is R\n- Cube 1's front face is B\n\nSo, for Cube 3:\n\n- From the right, F3 = Y, which is consistent.\n\nFor Cube 2:\n\n- From the right, F2 = R, but in reality, Cube 2's front face is B, so how can it look like R from the right?\n\nThis suggests that Cube 2 is rotated such that its right face is R when viewed from the right.\n\nSimilarly, Cube 1's front face is R, but from the right, it looks like B, so its right face is B.\n\nWait, that can't be. If Cube 1's front face is R, and its right face is B, then when viewed from the right, the front face is B, which is the face that's on the right side of Cube 1.\n\nSimilarly, Cube 2's front face is B, but from the right, it looks like R, so its right face is R.\n\nCube 3's front face is Y, and from the right, it's Y, so its right face is Y.\n\nBut wait, Cube 3's right face is Y, which is consistent.\n\nSo, let's assign:\n\nCube 3:\n\n- F3 = Y\n- B3 = Y\n- R3 = Y? Wait, no, each cube can only have two Y faces. So, F3 and B3 are both Y, so R3 and L3 must be R and B.\n\nSimilarly, Cube 2:\n\n- F2 = B\n- B2 = B\n- R2 = R (from right view)\n- So, L2 = ?\n\nCube 1:\n\n- F1 = R\n- R1 = B (from right view)\n- So, L1 = ?\n\nNow, let's try to assign the remaining faces.\n\nCube 3:\n\n- F3 = Y\n- B3 = Y\n- R3 = R\n- L3 = B\n\nBecause each cube has two R, two B, two Y.\n\nSo, Cube 3:\n\n- F3 = Y\n- B3 = Y\n- R3 = R\n- L3 = B\n- T3 = ?\n- Bot3 = ?\n\nBut each cube has exactly two of each color, so T3 and Bot3 must be R and B, but Cube 3 already has two R and two B in F, B, R, L.\n\nWait, no. Cube 3 has F=Y, B=Y, R=R, L=B, so that's two Y, one R, one B. Wait, that's only one R and one B. So, it needs another R and another B for T and Bot.\n\nTherefore, T3 and Bot3 must be R and B.\n\nBut let's think about the top view. When looking from the top, the colors we see are T3, T2, T1 from left to right.\n\nSo, we need to figure out T3, T2, T1.\n\nSimilarly for Cube 3, T3 and Bot3 must be R and B, but which is which?\n\nLet's assume T3 = R and Bot3 = B.\n\nBut let's check Cube 2.\n\nCube 2:\n\n- F2 = B\n- B2 = B\n- R2 = R (from right view)\n- So, L2 must be Y, because Cube 2 has two Y faces.\n\nWait, Cube 2's front is B, back is B, right is R, so L2 must be Y.\n\nTherefore, Cube 2:\n\n- F2 = B\n- B2 = B\n- R2 = R\n- L2 = Y\n- T2 = ?\n- Bot2 = ?\n\nEach cube has two of each color, so T2 and Bot2 must be R and Y, but Cube 2 already has two Y (L2 and T2/Bot2) and two B (F2 and B2). Wait, no, Cube 2 has:\n\n- F2 = B\n- B2 = B\n- R2 = R\n- L2 = Y\n- So, remaining faces T2 and Bot2 must be R and Y.\n\nBut each cube has two Y, two R, two B.\n\nSo, T2 and Bot2 must be R and Y.\n\nSimilarly, Cube 1:\n\n- F1 = R\n- R1 = B (from right view)\n- So, L1 must be Y, because Cube 1 has two Y faces.\n\nTherefore, Cube 1:\n\n- F1 = R\n- R1 = B\n- L1 = Y\n- So, remaining faces T1 and Bot1 must be B and Y.\n\nBut Cube 1 has two B and two Y.\n\nSo, T1 and Bot1 must be B and Y.\n\nNow, let's summarize:\n\nCube 1:\n\n- F1 = R\n- R1 = B\n- L1 = Y\n- So, T1 and Bot1 must be B and Y.\n\nCube 2:\n\n- F2 = B\n- B2 = B\n- R2 = R\n- L2 = Y\n- So, T2 and Bot"
