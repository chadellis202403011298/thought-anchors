  "question": "A marine biologist is studying the population growth of a specific type of algae in a controlled tank environment. She collects the following data points showing the percentage of the tank's surface covered by the algae over time:\n\nDay 0: 5%\nDay 2: 8%\nDay 4: 12.8%\nDay 6: 20.5%\nDay 8: 32.8%\n\nThe biologist wants to create a simple mathematical model to predict the coverage on Day 10. Which of the following models best represents the growth pattern in this data, and what would be the predicted coverage on Day 10?\n\nA) Linear model: Coverage increases by a constant amount each day\nB) Exponential model: Coverage increases by a constant percentage each day\nC) Logarithmic model: Growth rate slows down over time\nD) Power model: Coverage is proportional to time raised to a power",
  "answer": "To determine the best model for this algae growth data, I'll analyze the pattern of change between consecutive measurements.\n\nFirst, let's calculate how the coverage changes between each measurement:\n\nFrom Day 0 to Day 2: 8% - 5% = 3% increase (or 60% relative increase)\nFrom Day 2 to Day 4: 12.8% - 8% = 4.8% increase (or 60% relative increase)\nFrom Day 4 to Day 6: 20.5% - 12.8% = 7.7% increase (or approximately 60% relative increase)\nFrom Day 6 to Day 8: 32.8% - 20.5% = 12.3% increase (or approximately 60% relative increase)\n\nNotice that while the absolute increase grows larger each time (3%, then 4.8%, then 7.7%, then 12.3%), the relative increase remains approximately constant at 60% every 2 days. This is a key characteristic of exponential growth, where the population increases by a constant percentage over equal time intervals.\n\nThis pattern clearly fits option B: Exponential model, where coverage increases by a constant percentage each day.\n\nTo calculate the predicted coverage on Day 10, I'll use the formula for exponential growth: P(t) = P\u2080 \u00d7 (1 + r)^t\n\nWhile we could calculate the daily growth rate, I'll work with the 2-day growth rate since our data points are spaced 2 days apart:\n\nIf we start with 5% at Day 0 and grow by approximately 60% every 2 days, then:\nDay 10 coverage = 5% \u00d7 (1.6)^5 = 5% \u00d7 10.486 = 52.4%\n\nTherefore, according to the exponential model, the predicted algae coverage on Day 10 would be approximately 52.4% of the tank's surface."
