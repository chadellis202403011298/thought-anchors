When the system is 'Off', there is a 30% chance it transitions to 'Heating' in a given hour (otherwise it stays 'Off'). When the system is 'Heating', there is a 40% chance it transitions to 'Maintaining' in a given hour (otherwise it stays 'Heating'). When the system is 'Maintaining', there is a 20% chance it transitions to 'Off' in a given hour (otherwise it stays 'Maintaining'). If the system is currently in the 'Heating' state, what is the probability that it will be in the 'Maintaining' state exactly 2 hours from now? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I've got this problem about a home water heating system that can be in three states: 'Off', 'Heating', and 'Maintaining'. The system transitions between these states with certain probabilities each hour. The question is asking, if the system is currently in the 'Heating' state, what's the probability it will be in the 'Maintaining' state exactly 2 hours from now?\n\nLet me try to break this down. First, I need to understand the transition probabilities between each state. The problem gives me:\n\n- When the system is 'Off':\n  - 30% chance to transition to 'Heating'.\n  - 70% chance to stay 'Off'.\n\n- When the system is 'Heating':\n  - 40% chance to transition to 'Maintaining'.\n  - 60% chance to stay 'Heating'.\n\n- When the system is 'Maintaining':\n  - 20% chance to transition to 'Off'.\n  - 80% chance to stay 'Maintaining'.\n\nSo, the system can be modeled as a Markov chain with three states: Off (O), Heating (H), and Maintaining (M). Each hour, the system transitions based on these probabilities.\n\nSince we're starting in the 'Heating' state, I need to find the probability that after 2 hours, the system is in 'Maintaining'. To do this, I think I should model the state transitions step by step for each hour and see all possible paths that lead to 'Maintaining' in 2 hours.\n\nLet me denote the states as O, H, M for simplicity. Starting at H, we need to compute the state after 1 hour and then after 2 hours.\n\nFirst, after 1 hour:\n\nFrom H, the system can either stay in H or transition to M. The probability of staying in H is 60%, and transitioning to M is 40%.\n\nSo, after 1 hour:\n- P(H1) = 0.6\n- P(M1) = 0.4\n\nNow, moving to the second hour. Let's consider each possible state after the first hour and compute the probabilities for each state after the second hour.\n\nCase 1: After 1 hour, the system is in H (with probability 0.6). From H, the same transitions apply:\n- 60% chance to stay in H\n- 40% chance to go to M\n\nSo, from H1:\n- P(H2 | H1) = 0.6 * 0.6 = 0.36\n- P(M2 | H1) = 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.24\n\nCase 2: After 1 hour, the system is in M (with probability 0.4). From M, the transitions are:\n- 20% chance to go to O\n- 80% chance to stay in M\n\nSo, from M1:\n- P(O2 | M1) = 0.4 * 0.2 = 0.08\n- P(M2 | M1) = 0.4 * 0.8 = 0.32\n\nNow, to find the total probability of being in M after 2 hours, I need to sum the probabilities of all paths that end in M after 2 hours.\n\nLooking at Case 1: From H1, transitioning to M2 with probability 0.24.\nLooking at Case 2: From M1, staying in M2 with probability 0.32.\n\nSo, total P(M2) = 0.24 + 0.32 = 0.56\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me double-check.\n\nAfter 1 hour:\n- H1: 0.6\n- M1: 0.4\n\nAfter 2 hours:\n- From H1: 0.6 * 0.6 = 0.36 in H2; 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.24 in M2\n- From M1: 0.4 * 0.2 = 0.08 in O2; 0.4 * 0.8 = 0.32 in M2\n\nSo, M2 is the sum of transitions to M from H1 and M1:\n0.24 + 0.32 = 0.56\n\nSo, the probability is 0.56, which is 56%.\n\nI think that's it. Let me see if there's another way to approach this, maybe using matrices or something, but for only 2 hours, enumerating the possibilities seems straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, I can set up the transition matrix and compute the state after 2 steps.\n\nThe transition matrix P is:\n\nFrom \\ To | O   H   M\n--------|-----|-----|-----\nO       | 0.7 0.3  0.0\nH       | 0.0 0.6  0.4\nM       | 0.2 0.0  0.8\n\nStarting state vector S0 = [0, 1, 0] (since we're starting in H).\n\nAfter 1 hour, S1 = S0 * P = [0, 0.6, 0.4]\n\nAfter 2 hours, S2 = S1 * P = [0.6*0.7 + 0.4*0.2, 0.6*0.3 + 0.4*0.0, 0.6*0.4 + 0.4*0.8]\n\nWait, no, that's not the right multiplication. Wait, the state vector is a row vector, so it's S1 * P.\n\nBut actually, the multiplication is:\n\nS1 = [0, 0.6, 0.4]\n\nMultiply by P:\n\nO1 = 0*0.7 + 0.6*0 + 0.4*0.2 = 0.08\nH1 = 0*0.3 + 0.6*0.6 + 0.4*0.0 = 0.36\nM1 = 0*0.0 + 0.6*0.4 + 0.4*0.8 = 0.24 + 0.32 = 0.56\n\nWait, but that's after 2 hours? No, S1 is after 1 hour, and S2 is after 2 hours.\n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\nIf S0 is [0,1,0], then S1 = S0 * P = [0, 0.6, 0.4] (after 1 hour)\nThen S2 = S1 * P = [0.6*0.7 + 0.4*0.2, 0.6*0.3 + 0.4*0.0, 0.6*0.4 + 0.4*0.8] = [0.42 + 0.08, 0.18, 0.24 + 0.32] = [0.5, 0.18, 0.56]\n\nSo, the probability of being in M after 2 hours is 0.56, which matches my earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 0.56, which is 56%.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe probability that the system will be in the 'Maintaining' state exactly 2 hours from now is 56%.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Define the Transition Probabilities:**\n   - From 'Off' (O):\n     - 30% to 'Heating' (H)\n     - 70% to stay in 'Off' (O)\n   - From 'Heating' (H):\n     - 40% to 'Maintaining' (M)\n     - 60% to stay in 'Heating' (H)\n   - From 'Maintaining' (M):\n     - 20% to 'Off' (O)\n     - 80% to stay in 'Maintaining' (M)\n\n2. **Model as a Markov Chain:**\n   - States: O, H, M\n   - Transition matrix P:\n     ```\n     From\\To | O    H     M\n     ------|-----|-----|-----\n     O      | 0.7  0.3   0.0\n     H      | 0.0  0.6   0.4\n     M      | 0.2  0.0   0.8\n     ```\n\n3. **Initial State Vector:**\n   - Starting in 'Heating' (H): S\u2080 = [0, 1, 0]\n\n4. **Compute State After 1 Hour (S\u2081):**\n   - S\u2081 = S\u2080 * P = [0*0.7 + 1*0 + 0*0.2, 0*0.3 + 1*0.6 + 0*0.0, 0*0.0 + 1*0.4 + 0*0.8] = [0, 0.6, 0.4]\n\n5. **Compute State After 2 Hours (S\u2082):**\n   - S\u2082 = S\u2081 * P = [0.6*0.7 + 0.4*0.2, 0.6*0.3 + 0.4*0.0, 0.6*0.4 + 0.4*0.8] = [0.5, 0.18, 0.56]\n\n6. **Probability of Being in 'Maintaining' After 2 Hours:**\n   - P(M\u2082) = 0.56 or 56%\n\n**Answer:** The probability is 56%.\n\nDONE."

The system transitions between these states with certain probabilities each hour. The question is asking, if the system is currently in the Heating state, what's the probability it will be in the Maintaining state exactly 2 hours from now?\n\nHmm, okay, let me break this down. First, I need to understand the transition probabilities between the states.\n\nWhen the system is Off:\n- 30% chance to transition to Heating\n- 70% chance to stay Off\n\nWhen it's Heating:\n- 40% chance to transition to Maintaining\n- 60% chance to stay Heating\n\nAnd when it's Maintaining:\n- 20% chance to transition to Off\n- 80% chance to stay Maintaining\n\nSo, the system can be modeled as a Markov chain with three states: Off (O), Heating (H), and Maintaining (M). The transition matrix would look something like this:\n\n```\n          O     H     M\nO        0.7   0.3    0.0\nH        0.0   0.6    0.4\nM        0.2   0.0    0.8\n```\n\nWait, no. Hold on. When in Off, it can only go to Heating or stay Off. So, the transition from O to H is 0.3, and O to O is 0.7. From H, it can go to M with 0.4 or stay H with 0.6. From M, it can go to O with 0.2 or stay M with 0.8.\n\nSo the transition matrix \\( P \\) is:\n\n\\[\nP = \\begin{pmatrix}\n0.7 & 0.3 & 0.0 \\\\\n0.0 & 0.6 & 0.4 \\\\\n0.2 & 0.0 & 0.8 \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nRight. Now, the initial state is Heating, which is state H. We need to find the probability that exactly 2 hours from now, the system is in Maintaining state M.\n\nSo, to find the probability after 2 hours, I can compute the state distribution after 2 steps, starting from H.\n\nIn a Markov chain, the state distribution after \\( n \\) steps can be found by raising the transition matrix \\( P \\) to the \\( n \\)-th power and multiplying it by the initial state vector.\n\nLet me denote the initial state vector as \\( \\pi_0 \\). Since we're starting in H, \\( \\pi_0 = [0, 1, 0] \\).\n\nThen, the state distribution after 1 hour is \\( \\pi_1 = \\pi_0 \\times P \\).\n\nAfter 2 hours, it's \\( \\pi_2 = \\pi_1 \\times P = \\pi_0 \\times P^2 \\).\n\nSo, I need to compute \\( P^2 \\) and then multiply it by \\( \\pi_0 \\).\n\nLet me compute \\( P^2 \\).\n\nFirst, \\( P^2 = P \\times P \\).\n\nLet me compute each element of the resulting matrix.\n\nThe element \\( (i,j) \\) of \\( P^2 \\) is the sum over \\( k \\) of \\( P(i,k) \\times P(k,j) \\).\n\nSo, let's compute each row step by step.\n\nFirst row of \\( P^2 \\):\n\n- \\( (O, O) \\): \\( P(O,O) \\times P(O,O) + P(O,M) \\times P(M,O) \\)\nWait, no. Wait, in matrix multiplication, each element is the dot product of the corresponding row of the first matrix and column of the second matrix.\n\nWait, actually, in \\( P^2 \\), which is \\( P \\times P \\), the element \\( (i,j) \\) is the sum over \\( k \\) of \\( P(i,k) \\times P(k,j) \\).\n\nSo, let's compute each element:\n\n1. \\( (O, O) \\): \\( P(O,O) \\times P(O,O) + P(O,M) \\times P(M,O) \\)\nBut wait, in the transition matrix, \\( P(M,O) \\) is 0.2, right? Because from M, 20% chance to go to O.\n\nWait, no. Wait, let me clarify.\n\nWait, in the transition matrix, each row is the current state, and each column is the next state.\n\nSo, \\( P(i,k) \\) is the probability of going from state \\( i \\) to state \\( k \\).\n\nSo, for \\( P^2(O,O) \\), it's the probability of going from O to O in two steps. That can happen either by staying O both times or going from O to H and then H to O.\n\nWait, no, in two steps: from O to O in two steps. So, first step: O can go to O or H. If it goes to O, then the second step is O again. If it goes to H, then from H, it can go to H or M, but to get back to O, from H, it can only go to M or stay H, so actually, from O, going to H, and then from H, you can't go back to O in one step. So, actually, the only way to get from O to O in two steps is to stay O both times.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, from O, in the first step, it can go to O or H. If it goes to H, then in the second step, from H, it can go to M or stay H. So, to get back to O in two steps, you have to go from O to H, and then from H to O. But from H, you can't go to O directly. From H, you can go to M or stay H. So, actually, you can't get from H to O in one step. Therefore, the only way to get back to O in two steps is to stay in O both times.\n\nSimilarly, from O to H in two steps: either go O to O to H, or O to H to H.\n\nWait, no, O to H can happen in one step or two steps.\n\nWait, let me be precise.\n\nTo compute \\( P^2 \\), each element \\( (i,j) \\) is the sum over \\( k \\) of \\( P(i,k) \\times P(k,j) \\).\n\nSo, for \\( P^2(O,O) \\):\n\n\\( P(O,O) \\times P(O,O) + P(O,M) \\times P(M,O) \\)\n\nBut \\( P(M,O) \\) is 0.2, and \\( P(O,M) \\) is 0.0, because from O, you can't go directly to M. So, \\( P(O,M) = 0 \\).\n\nThus, \\( P^2(O,O) = 0.7 \\times 0.7 + 0.3 \\times 0.2 = 0.49 + 0.06 = 0.55 \\).\n\nSimilarly, \\( P^2(O,H) \\):\n\n\\( P(O,O) \\times P(O,H) + P(O,M) \\times P(M,H) \\)\n\nBut \\( P(M,H) = 0 \\), since from M, you can only go to O or stay M.\n\nSo, \\( P^2(O,H) = 0.7 \\times 0.3 + 0.3 \\times 0 = 0.21 + 0 = 0.21 \\).\n\n\\( P^2(O,M) \\):\n\n\\( P(O,O) \\times P(O,M) + P(O,H) \\times P(H,M) \\)\n\n\\( P(O,M) = 0 \\), so:\n\n\\( 0.7 \\times 0 + 0.3 \\times 0.4 = 0 + 0.12 = 0.12 \\).\n\nSo, first row of \\( P^2 \\) is [0.55, 0.21, 0.12].\n\nNow, second row: starting from H.\n\n\\( P^2(H,O) \\):\n\n\\( P(H,O) \\times P(O,O) + P(H,M) \\times P(M,O) \\)\n\nBut \\( P(H,O) = 0 \\), and \\( P(M,O) = 0.2 \\).\n\nSo, \\( 0 \\times 0.7 + 0.4 \\times 0.2 = 0 + 0.08 = 0.08 \\).\n\n\\( P^2(H,H) \\):\n\n\\( P(H,O) \\times P(O,H) + P(H,M) \\times P(M,H) \\)\n\nAgain, \\( P(H,O) = 0 \\), \\( P(M,H) = 0 \\).\n\nSo, \\( 0 \\times 0.3 + 0.4 \\times 0 = 0 + 0 = 0 \\).\n\n\\( P^2(H,M) \\):\n\n\\( P(H,O) \\times P(O,M) + P(H,M) \\times P(M,M) \\)\n\n\\( P(H,O) = 0 \\), \\( P(M,M) = 0.8 \\).\n\nSo, \\( 0 \\times 0 + 0.4 \\times 0.8 = 0 + 0.32 = 0.32 \\).\n\nSo, second row of \\( P^2 \\) is [0.08, 0, 0.32].\n\nThird row: starting from M.\n\n\\( P^2(M,O) \\):\n\n\\( P(M,O) \\times P(O,O) + P(M,M) \\times P(M,O) \\)\n\n\\( P(M,O) = 0.2 \\), \\( P(M,M) = 0.8 \\).\n\nSo, \\( 0.2 \\times 0.7 + 0.8 \\times 0.2 = 0.14 + 0.16 = 0.30 \\).\n\n\\( P^2(M,H) \\):\n\n\\( P(M,O) \\times P(O,H) + P(M,M) \\times P(M,H) \\)\n\n\\( P(M,H) = 0 \\), so:\n\n\\( 0.2 \\times 0.3 + 0.8 \\times 0 = 0.06 + 0 = 0.06 \\).\n\n\\( P^2(M,M) \\):\n\n\\( P(M,O) \\times P(O,M) + P(M,M) \\times P(M,M) \\)\n\n\\( P(M,O) = 0.2 \\), \\( P(O,M) = 0 \\), \\( P(M,M) = 0.8 \\).\n\nSo, \\( 0.2 \\times 0 + 0.8 \\times 0.8 = 0 + 0.64 = 0.64 \\).\n\nThus, third row of \\( P^2 \\) is [0.30, 0.06, 0.64].\n\nSo, putting it all together, \\( P^2 \\) is:\n\n\\[\nP^2 = \\begin{pmatrix}\n0.55 & 0.21 & 0.12 \\\\\n0.08 & 0.00 & 0.32 \\\\\n0.30 & 0.06 & 0.64 \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nNow, the initial state vector \\( \\pi_0 \\) is [0, 1, 0].\n\nSo, \\( \\pi_2 = \\pi_0 \\times P^2 \\).\n\nLet me compute that.\n\nMultiplying \\( \\pi_0 \\) (row vector) by \\( P^2 \\):\n\n\\( \\pi_2(O) = 0 \\times 0.55 + 1 \\times 0.08 + 0 \\times 0.30 = 0 + 0.08 + 0 = 0.08 \\)\n\n\\( \\pi_2(H) = 0 \\times 0.21 + 1 \\times 0.00 + 0 \\times 0.06 = 0 + 0 + 0 = 0 \\)\n\n\\( \\pi_2(M) = 0 \\times 0.12 + 1 \\times 0.32 + 0 \\times 0.64 = 0 + 0.32 + 0 = 0.32 \\)\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because if we start in H, after two steps, the probability of being in M is 0.32? Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, no, actually, I think I made a mistake in the multiplication. Because \\( \\pi_0 \\) is a row vector, and \\( P^2 \\) is a matrix, so the multiplication should be:\n\n\\( \\pi_2 = \\pi_0 \\times P^2 \\)\n\nWhich is:\n\n\\( [0, 1, 0] \\times P^2 \\)\n\nSo, the first element is:\n\n0*0.55 + 1*0.08 + 0*0.30 = 0 + 0.08 + 0 = 0.08\n\nSecond element:\n\n0*0.21 + 1*0.00 + 0*0.06 = 0 + 0 + 0 = 0\n\nThird element:\n\n0*0.12 + 1*0.32 + 0*0.64 = 0 + 0.32 + 0 = 0.32\n\nSo yes, that seems correct. So, after two hours, the probability of being in Maintaining is 0.32, which is 32%.\n\nWait, but let me think about this intuitively. Starting from Heating, in the first hour, there's a 40% chance to go to Maintaining. Then, from Maintaining, in the next hour, there's a 20% chance to go back to Off, and 80% to stay in Maintaining.\n\nSo, the probability of being in Maintaining after two hours can be calculated by considering all possible paths:\n\n1. Heating -> Maintaining -> Maintaining\n\nProbability: 0.4 (H to M) * 0.8 (M to M) = 0.32\n\n2. Heating -> Maintaining -> Off\n\nProbability: 0.4 * 0.2 = 0.08\n\n3. Heating -> Heating -> Maintaining\n\nProbability: 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.24\n\n4. Heating -> Heating -> Heating\n\nProbability: 0.6 * 0.6 = 0.36\n\nWait, but these are all possible paths after two steps. However, we need the probability of being in Maintaining, which is the sum of the probabilities of the paths that end in M.\n\nSo, path 1: H -> M -> M: contributes 0.32\n\nPath 3: H -> H -> M: contributes 0.24\n\nSo total probability is 0.32 + 0.24 = 0.56\n\nWait, that's conflicting with the previous result of 0.32. Hmm, so where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, no. Actually, in the Markov chain, the probability after two steps is the sum over all possible paths that end in M.\n\nBut in my initial calculation using \\( P^2 \\), I got 0.32 for M. But when I think about it as summing the probabilities of the paths, I get 0.56.\n\nThis discrepancy suggests I made a mistake in computing \\( P^2 \\).\n\nLet me double-check the \\( P^2 \\) computation.\n\nEarlier, I computed \\( P^2 \\) as:\n\n\\[\nP^2 = \\begin{pmatrix}\n0.55 & 0.21 & 0.12 \\\\\n0.08 & 0.00 & 0.32 \\\\\n0.30 & 0.06 & 0.64 \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nBut when I compute \\( P^2 \\) again, let's see:\n\nCompute \\( P^2 \\) step by step.\n\nFirst, the rows and columns:\n\n- Row 1: From O\n- Row 2: From H\n- Row 3: From M\n\nColumns: O, H, M.\n\nCompute each element:\n\n1. \\( (O, O) \\):\n\n\\( P(O,O) * P(O,O) + P(O,M) * P(M,O) \\)\n\n= 0.7*0.7 + 0.0*0.2 = 0.49 + 0 = 0.49\n\nWait, no. Wait, in \\( P^2 \\), \\( (O, O) \\) is the probability of going from O to O in two steps. That can happen by:\n\n- Staying O both times: 0.7 * 0.7 = 0.49\n\n- Going O -> H -> O: but from H, you can't go back to O in one step, so this path is impossible.\n\nTherefore, \\( P^2(O, O) = 0.49 \\)\n\nSimilarly, \\( P^2(O, H) \\):\n\n= P(O, O)*P(O, H) + P(O, M)*P(M, H)\n\n= 0.7*0.3 + 0.0*0.0 = 0.21 + 0 = 0.21\n\n\\( P^2(O, M) \\):\n\n= P(O, O)*P(O, M) + P(O, H)*P(H, M)\n\n= 0.7*0.0 + 0.3*0.4 = 0 + 0.12 = 0.12\n\nSo, first row: [0.49, 0.21, 0.12]\n\nSecond row: From H.\n\n\\( P^2(H, O) \\):\n\n= P(H, O)*P(O, O) + P(H, M)*P(M, O)\n\n= 0.0*0.7 + 0.4*0.2 = 0 + 0.08 = 0.08\n\n\\( P^2(H, H) \\):\n\n= P(H, O)*P(O, H) + P(H, M)*P(M, H)\n\n= 0.0*0.3 + 0.4*0.0 = 0 + 0 = 0\n\n\\( P^2(H, M) \\):\n\n= P(H, O)*P(O, M) + P(H, M)*P(M, M)\n\n= 0.0*0.0 + 0.4*0.8 = 0 + 0.32 = 0.32\n\nSo, second row: [0.08, 0, 0.32]\n\nThird row: From M.\n\n\\( P^2(M, O) \\):\n\n= P(M, O)*P(O, O) + P(M, M)*P(M, O)\n\n= 0.2*0.7 + 0.8*0.2 = 0"

When the system is 'Off', there is a 30% chance it transitions to 'Heating' in a given hour (otherwise it stays 'Off'). When the system is 'Heating', there is a 40% chance it transitions to 'Maintaining' in a given hour (otherwise it stays 'Heating'). When the system is 'Maintaining', there is a 20% chance it transitions to 'Off' in a given hour (otherwise it stays 'Maintaining'). If the system is currently in the 'Heating' state, what is the probability that it will be in the 'Maintaining' state exactly 2 hours from now? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out the probability that a home water heating system will be in the 'Maintaining' state exactly 2 hours from now, given that it's currently in the 'Heating' state. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should probably outline the transition probabilities for each state. The system can be in three states: 'Off', 'Heating', or 'Maintaining'. The transitions are as follows:\n\n1. **From 'Off':**\n   - 30% chance to transition to 'Heating' in the next hour.\n   - 70% chance to stay in 'Off'.\n\n2. **From 'Heating':**\n   - 40% chance to transition to 'Maintaining' in the next hour.\n   - 60% chance to stay in 'Heating'.\n\n3. **From 'Maintaining':**\n   - 20% chance to transition to 'Off' in the next hour.\n   - 80% chance to stay in 'Maintaining'.\n\nOkay, so right now, the system is in 'Heating'. I need to find the probability that it's in 'Maintaining' exactly 2 hours from now. That means I have to consider what happens in the first hour and then in the second hour.\n\nLet me think about this as a Markov chain problem. Each state transition can be represented as a matrix, but since I'm dealing with two steps, maybe I can compute the state probabilities step by step.\n\nStarting at time t=0, the system is in 'Heating' (H). I need to find the state at t=2.\n\n**First Hour (t=1):**\n\nFrom 'Heating' (H), the system can either stay in 'Heating' or transition to 'Maintaining' with probabilities 60% and 40%, respectively.\n\nSo, at t=1, the probabilities are:\n- P(H at t=1) = 0.6\n- P(M at t=1) = 0.4\n\n**Second Hour (t=2):**\n\nNow, from t=1, the system could be either in 'Heating' or 'Maintaining'. I need to consider both possibilities.\n\n1. **If the system is in 'Heating' at t=1 (probability 0.6):**\n   - From 'Heating', again, 40% chance to go to 'Maintaining' and 60% to stay in 'Heating'.\n   \n   So, the contribution to 'Maintaining' at t=2 from this path is 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.24.\n\n2. **If the system is in 'Maintaining' at t=1 (probability 0.4):**\n   - From 'Maintaining', 20% chance to go to 'Off' and 80% chance to stay in 'Maintaining'.\n   \n   However, 'Off' is not 'Maintaining', so this path doesn't contribute to 'Maintaining' at t=2. It only contributes to 'Off'.\n\nWait, but I need to track 'Maintaining' specifically. So, only the transition from 'Heating' to 'Maintaining' in the second hour contributes to 'Maintaining' at t=2.\n\nSo, the total probability P(M at t=2) is the sum of the probabilities of being in 'Heating' at t=1 and then transitioning to 'Maintaining' in the second hour.\n\nThat is:\n\nP(M at t=2) = P(H at t=1) * P(H\u2192M) = 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.24.\n\nWait, is that all? Let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider all possible paths over two hours.\n\nAt t=0: H\n\nAt t=1: can be H or M\n\nAt t=2: from each state at t=1, transition to possible states.\n\nBut since we're only interested in 'Maintaining' at t=2, we can consider only the paths that end in 'Maintaining'.\n\nSo, the only way to be in 'Maintaining' at t=2 is:\n\nt=0: H \u2192 t=1: H \u2192 t=2: M\n\nOr\n\nt=0: H \u2192 t=1: M \u2192 t=2: M\n\nWait, but from 'Maintaining', it can either stay in 'Maintaining' or go to 'Off'. So, from 'Maintaining' at t=1, the system can stay in 'Maintaining' with 80% probability or go to 'Off' with 20%. So, the probability of being in 'Maintaining' at t=2 via this path is P(M at t=1) * 0.8.\n\nBut wait, the question is about being in 'Maintaining' at t=2, so only the transitions into 'Maintaining' count.\n\nSo, actually, the two paths contributing to 'Maintaining' at t=2 are:\n\n1. H \u2192 H \u2192 M\n\n2. H \u2192 M \u2192 M\n\nBut wait, from 'M' at t=1, the system can stay in 'M' with 80% chance, so the second path is H \u2192 M (t=1) and then M \u2192 M (t=2), contributing 0.4 * 0.8 = 0.32.\n\nBut wait, the first path is H \u2192 H (t=1) and then H \u2192 M (t=2), which is 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.24.\n\nSo, total P(M at t=2) = 0.24 + 0.32 = 0.56.\n\nWait, that contradicts my earlier conclusion. Hmm.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify.\n\nAt t=1, the system can be in H or M.\n\nAt t=2, from H, it can go to M or stay in H.\n\nFrom M, it can go to Off or stay in M.\n\nBut we're interested in being in M at t=2, so we need to consider all the ways the system can be in M at t=2.\n\nSo, the two paths are:\n\n1. H \u2192 H \u2192 M\n\n2. H \u2192 M \u2192 M\n\nEach of these contributes to being in M at t=2.\n\nSo, the probability is:\n\nP(H at t=1) * P(H\u2192M) + P(M at t=1) * P(M\u2192M)\n\n= 0.6 * 0.4 + 0.4 * 0.8\n\n= 0.24 + 0.32\n\n= 0.56\n\nSo, the probability is 0.56, or 56%.\n\nWait, that seems higher than my initial thought. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should model this as a transition matrix and compute the state probabilities after two steps.\n\nLet me denote the states as O (Off), H (Heating), M (Maintaining).\n\nThe transition matrix P is:\n\nFrom \\ To | O      H       M\n---------------------------------\nO        | 0.7    0.3     0.0\nH        | 0.0    0.6     0.4\nM        | 0.2    0.0     0.8\n\nSo, starting from H, the initial state vector is [0, 1, 0].\n\nAfter one hour, the state vector is:\n\n[0, 0.6, 0.4]\n\nAfter two hours, we multiply this vector by the transition matrix again.\n\nSo:\n\nFirst, the second hour:\n\nFrom H: 0.6 * [0, 0.6, 0.4] = 0.6 * [0, 0.6, 0.4] = [0, 0.36, 0.24]\n\nFrom M: 0.4 * [0, 0.6, 0.4] = [0, 0.24, 0.16]\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Actually, the state vector after the first hour is [0, 0.6, 0.4]. Then, to get the state after the second hour, we multiply this by P.\n\nSo:\n\nP_second = P * P_initial\n\nWait, no, P is the transition matrix, so to compute the next state, it's P_current * P.\n\nSo, P_initial = [0, 1, 0]\n\nP_after_1 = P_initial * P\n\n= [0*0.7 + 1*0 + 0*0.2, 0*0.3 + 1*0.6 + 0*0, 0*0.0 + 1*0.4 + 0*0.8]\n\n= [0, 0.6, 0.4]\n\nThen, P_after_2 = P_after_1 * P\n\n= [0*0.7 + 0.6*0 + 0.4*0.2, 0*0.3 + 0.6*0.6 + 0.4*0, 0*0.0 + 0.6*0.4 + 0.4*0.8]\n\nCompute each component:\n\nFirst component (Off):\n\n0*0.7 + 0.6*0 + 0.4*0.2 = 0 + 0 + 0.08 = 0.08\n\nSecond component (Heating):\n\n0*0.3 + 0.6*0.6 + 0.4*0 = 0 + 0.36 + 0 = 0.36\n\nThird component (Maintaining):\n\n0*0.0 + 0.6*0.4 + 0.4*0.8 = 0 + 0.24 + 0.32 = 0.56\n\nSo, the state vector after two hours is [0.08, 0.36, 0.56].\n\nTherefore, the probability of being in 'Maintaining' exactly two hours from now is 0.56.\n\nSo, the answer is 0.56, or 56%.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 0.56, and then I doubted myself, but the matrix method confirms it.\n\nSo, I think 0.56 is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe probability that the system will be in the 'Maintaining' state exactly 2 hours from now is 0.56.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Define Transition Probabilities:**\n   - From 'Off': 30% to 'Heating', 70% stay.\n   - From 'Heating': 40% to 'Maintaining', 60% stay.\n   - From 'Maintaining': 20% to 'Off', 80% stay.\n\n2. **Initial State:** The system is currently in 'Heating' (H).\n\n3. **First Hour (t=1):**\n   - From 'Heating', it transitions to 'Maintaining' with 40% (0.4) or stays in 'Heating' with 60% (0.6).\n   - Probabilities at t=1: H=0.6, M=0.4.\n\n4. **Second Hour (t=2):**\n   - From 'Heating' (t=1): 40% to 'Maintaining' (0.6*0.4=0.24).\n   - From 'Maintaining' (t=1): 80% stay in 'Maintaining' (0.4*0.8=0.32).\n   - Total 'Maintaining' at t=2: 0.24 + 0.32 = 0.56.\n\n5. **Verification Using Transition Matrix:**\n   - Transition matrix applied twice confirms the result: [0.08, 0.36, 0.56], with 'Maintaining' at 0.56.\n\n**Answer:** The probability is 0.56.\n\nDONE."

If the system is currently in the 'Heating' state, what is the probability that it will be in the 'Maintaining' state exactly 2 hours from now? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out the probability that a home water heating system will be in the 'Maintaining' state exactly 2 hours from now, given that it's currently in the 'Heating' state. The system can be in one of three states: Off, Heating, or Maintaining. Each state has different transition probabilities to the other states each hour.\n\nFirst, let's summarize the transition probabilities:\n\n- **From Off**:\n  - 30% chance to transition to Heating.\n  - 70% chance to stay Off.\n\n- **From Heating**:\n  - 40% chance to transition to Maintaining.\n  - 60% chance to stay Heating.\n\n- **From Maintaining**:\n  - 20% chance to transition to Off.\n  - 80% chance to stay Maintaining.\n\nGiven that the system is currently in the Heating state, I need to find the probability it will be in Maintaining after 2 hours. Since each hour is independent, I can model this as a Markov chain with transitions happening each hour.\n\nLet me denote the states as follows:\n- O: Off\n- H: Heating\n- M: Maintaining\n\nI'll represent the states as a vector, where each element corresponds to the probability of being in that state. Since we're dealing with probabilities, they should sum to 1.\n\nStarting at time 0 (current state), the system is in H, so the initial probability vector is [0, 1, 0].\n\nNow, each hour, the system transitions according to the given probabilities. So, for each hour, I can multiply the current probability vector by a transition matrix.\n\nThe transition matrix P looks like this:\n\n```\n          O     H      M\nO      0.7    0.3     0.0\nH      0.0    0.6     0.4\nM      0.2    0.0     0.8\n```\n\nWait, actually, in the transition matrix, each row represents the current state, and each column represents the next state. So, row 1 is from O, row 2 from H, and row 3 from M.\n\nSo, to correct that:\n\n```\n          O      H      M\nO      0.7    0.3     0.0\nH      0.0    0.6     0.4\nM      0.2    0.0     0.8\n```\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSince the system starts at H, the initial probability vector is [0, 1, 0]. After one hour, the probability vector will be:\n\n[0, 1, 0] * P = [0*0.7 + 1*0.0 + 0*0.2, 0*0.3 + 1*0.6 + 0*0.0, 0*0.0 + 1*0.4 + 0*0.8] = [0, 0.6, 0.4]\n\nSo after 1 hour, the probabilities are: O=0, H=0.6, M=0.4.\n\nNow, after 2 hours, we'll apply the transition matrix again.\n\nSo, the vector after 1 hour is [0, 0.6, 0.4]. Multiplying by P:\n\nFirst element (O):\n0*0.7 + 0.6*0.0 + 0.4*0.2 = 0 + 0 + 0.08 = 0.08\n\nSecond element (H):\n0*0.3 + 0.6*0.6 + 0.4*0.0 = 0 + 0.36 + 0 = 0.36\n\nThird element (M):\n0*0.0 + 0.6*0.4 + 0.4*0.8 = 0 + 0.24 + 0.32 = 0.56\n\nSo, after 2 hours, the probability vector is [0.08, 0.36, 0.56].\n\nTherefore, the probability of being in Maintaining (M) exactly 2 hours from now is 0.56, which is 56%.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting at H: [0,1,0]\n\nAfter 1 hour:\n- From H, 60% stay in H, 40% go to M.\nSo, [0, 0.6, 0.4]. That seems correct.\n\nAfter 2 hours:\n- From H: 0.6 * 0.6 = 0.36 stays in H.\n- From H: 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.24 goes to M.\n- From M: 0.4 * 0.8 = 0.32 stays in M.\n- From M: 0.4 * 0.2 = 0.08 goes to O.\n\nSo, O: 0.08, H: 0.36, M: 0.24 + 0.32 = 0.56. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the probability is 0.56, which is 56%.\n\nBut wait, the question asks for exactly 2 hours from now. So, yes, after two transitions, it's 0.56.\n\nAlternatively, I could model this using state transitions step by step.\n\nAt time 0: H\n\nAfter 1 hour: 60% H, 40% M.\n\nAfter 2 hours:\n\nFrom the 60% in H:\n- 60% of that 60% = 36% stay in H.\n- 40% of that 60% = 24% go to M.\n\nFrom the 40% in M:\n- 80% of that 40% = 32% stay in M.\n- 20% of that 40% = 8% go to O.\n\nSo total probabilities:\n- O: 8%\n- H: 36%\n- M: 24% + 32% = 56%\n\nYes, that's consistent with the earlier result.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 0.56 or 56%.\n</think>\n\nThe probability that the system will be in the 'Maintaining' state exactly 2 hours from now is 56%.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Understand the Transition Probabilities:**\n   - **Off (O):** 30% chance to transition to Heating (H), 70% chance to stay Off.\n   - **Heating (H):** 40% chance to transition to Maintaining (M), 60% chance to stay Heating.\n   - **Maintaining (M):** 20% chance to transition to Off (O), 80% chance to stay Maintaining.\n\n2. **Construct the Transition Matrix:**\n   ```\n       O      H      M\n   O  0.7    0.3     0.0\n   H  0.0    0.6     0.4\n   M  0.2    0.0     0.8\n   ```\n\n3. **Initial State Vector:**\n   - Starting in Heating (H), so the initial probabilities are [0, 1, 0].\n\n4. **Calculate State Probabilities After 1 Hour:**\n   - Multiply initial vector by the transition matrix:\n     ```\n     [0, 1, 0] * P = [0, 0.6, 0.4]\n     ```\n   - Probabilities: O=0, H=60%, M=40%.\n\n5. **Calculate State Probabilities After 2 Hours:**\n   - Multiply the probabilities after 1 hour by the transition matrix:\n     ```\n     [0, 0.6, 0.4] * P = [0.08, 0.36, 0.56]\n     ```\n   - Probabilities: O=8%, H=36%, M=56%.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The probability of being in Maintaining (M) exactly 2 hours from now is 56%.\n\n**Answer:** The probability is 0.56 or 56%, so the system has a 56% chance of being in the 'Maintaining' state exactly 2 hours from now.\n\nDONE."

If the system is currently in the 'Heating' state, what is the probability that it will be in the 'Maintaining' state exactly 2 hours from now? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this problem about a home water heating system that can be in three states: Off, Heating, or Maintaining. The system transitions between these states with certain probabilities each hour. The question is, if the system is currently in the Heating state, what's the probability it will be in the Maintaining state exactly two hours from now?\n\nOkay, let's break this down. First, I need to understand the transition probabilities. The system can be in one of three states, and each state has its own transition probabilities.\n\n1. **Off State:**\n   - 30% chance to transition to Heating.\n   - 70% chance to stay Off.\n\n2. **Heating State:**\n   - 40% chance to transition to Maintaining.\n   - 60% chance to stay Heating.\n\n3. **Maintaining State:**\n   - 20% chance to transition to Off.\n   - 80% chance to stay Maintaining.\n\nSo, starting from Heating, I need to find the probability that two hours from now it's in Maintaining. Since each transition is independent each hour, I can model this as a Markov chain with transitions happening each hour.\n\nTo approach this, I think I can use state transitions over two steps. Let me represent the possible states and their probabilities at each hour.\n\nLet's denote:\n- \\( P(t) \\) as the probability of being in state 'Off' at time \\( t \\).\n- \\( Q(t) \\) as the probability of being in state 'Heating' at time \\( t \\).\n- \\( R(t) \\) as the probability of being in state 'Maintaining' at time \\( t \\).\n\nGiven that the system starts in Heating, so at \\( t = 0 \\):\n- \\( P(0) = 0 \\)\n- \\( Q(0) = 1 \\)\n- \\( R(0) = 0 \\)\n\nNow, for each subsequent hour, I can write equations based on the transition probabilities.\n\nLet's compute \\( t = 1 \\) first.\n\n**At \\( t = 1 \\):**\n- From Off: 30% chance to Heating, 70% to stay Off.\n- From Heating: 40% to Maintaining, 60% to stay Heating.\n- From Maintaining: 20% to Off, 80% to stay Maintaining.\n\nBut at \\( t = 0 \\), \\( P(0) = 0 \\), so the contribution from Off at \\( t = 1 \\) is 0. Similarly, \\( R(0) = 0 \\), so there's no contribution from Maintaining at \\( t = 1 \\).\n\nSo, \\( P(1) = 0 \\times 0.30 + 1 \\times 0 + 0 \\times 0.20 = 0 \\)\nWait, that seems off. Actually, maybe I should model the transitions correctly.\n\nWait, no, the transitions are from the current state to the next state. So, to compute \\( P(1) \\), it's the sum of all possible ways to get to Off at \\( t = 1 \\).\n\nWhich can come from:\n- From Off: 70% stay Off.\n- From Heating: 0% transition to Off.\n- From Maintaining: 20% transition to Off.\n\nBut at \\( t = 0 \\), the system is Heating, so only the transitions from Heating contribute to \\( P(1) \\). Specifically, from Heating, the chance to stay Heating is 60%, so the chance to transition to Off is 0%.\n\nWait, no. Wait, from Heating, the system can transition to Maintaining or stay Heating. It cannot transition to Off directly. So, to reach Off at \\( t = 1 \\), the only way is if the system was in Maintaining at \\( t = 0 \\) and then transitions to Off. But at \\( t = 0 \\), the system is in Heating, so \\( R(0) = 0 \\). Therefore, \\( P(1) = 0 \\).\n\nSimilarly, \\( Q(1) \\) can come from:\n- From Off: 30% transition to Heating.\n- From Heating: 60% stay Heating.\n- From Maintaining: 0% transition to Heating.\n\nBut again, at \\( t = 0 \\), Off and Maintaining are 0, so \\( Q(1) = 0 \\times 0.30 + 1 \\times 0.60 + 0 \\times 0 = 0.60 \\).\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, \\( Q(1) = 0.60 \\).\n\nSimilarly, \\( R(1) \\) can come from:\n- From Off: 0% transition to Maintaining.\n- From Heating: 40% transition to Maintaining.\n- From Maintaining: 0% transition to Maintaining (since from Maintaining, it can only stay or go to Off).\n\nBut at \\( t = 0 \\), Off is 0, so \\( R(1) = 0 \\times 0 + 1 \\times 0.40 + 0 \\times 0 = 0.40 \\).\n\nSo, at \\( t = 1 \\):\n- \\( P(1) = 0 \\)\n- \\( Q(1) = 0.60 \\)\n- \\( R(1) = 0.40 \\)\n\nNow, moving to \\( t = 2 \\):\n\nCompute \\( P(2) \\), \\( Q(2) \\), and \\( R(2) \\).\n\nStarting with \\( P(2) \\): the probability to be in Off at \\( t = 2 \\).\n\nThis can come from:\n- From Off at \\( t = 1 \\): 70% stay Off.\n- From Heating at \\( t = 1 \\): 0% transition to Off.\n- From Maintaining at \\( t = 1 \\): 20% transition to Off.\n\nBut at \\( t = 1 \\), \\( P(1) = 0 \\), \\( Q(1) = 0.60 \\), \\( R(1) = 0.40 \\).\n\nSo, \\( P(2) = 0 \\times 0.70 + 0.60 \\times 0 + 0.40 \\times 0.20 = 0 + 0 + 0.08 = 0.08 \\).\n\nNext, \\( Q(2) \\): probability to be in Heating at \\( t = 2 \\).\n\nThis can come from:\n- From Off at \\( t = 1 \\): 30% transition to Heating.\n- From Heating at \\( t = 1 \\): 60% stay Heating.\n- From Maintaining at \\( t = 1 \\): 0% transition to Heating.\n\nSo, \\( Q(2) = 0 \\times 0.30 + 0.60 \\times 0.60 + 0.40 \\times 0 = 0 + 0.36 + 0 = 0.36 \\).\n\nFinally, \\( R(2) \\): probability to be in Maintaining at \\( t = 2 \\).\n\nThis can come from:\n- From Off at \\( t = 1 \\): 0% transition to Maintaining.\n- From Heating at \\( t = 1 \\): 40% transition to Maintaining.\n- From Maintaining at \\( t = 1 \\): 80% stay Maintaining.\n\nSo, \\( R(2) = 0 \\times 0 + 0.60 \\times 0.40 + 0.40 \\times 0.80 = 0 + 0.24 + 0.32 = 0.56 \\).\n\nWait, let me verify these calculations.\n\nFor \\( P(2) \\):\n- From Off: 0 * 0.70 = 0\n- From Heating: 0.60 * 0 = 0\n- From Maintaining: 0.40 * 0.20 = 0.08\nTotal: 0.08\n\nFor \\( Q(2) \\):\n- From Off: 0 * 0.30 = 0\n- From Heating: 0.60 * 0.60 = 0.36\n- From Maintaining: 0.40 * 0 = 0\nTotal: 0.36\n\nFor \\( R(2) \\):\n- From Off: 0 * 0 = 0\n- From Heating: 0.60 * 0.40 = 0.24\n- From Maintaining: 0.40 * 0.80 = 0.32\nTotal: 0.24 + 0.32 = 0.56\n\nSo, at \\( t = 2 \\), the probabilities are:\n- Off: 0.08\n- Heating: 0.36\n- Maintaining: 0.56\n\nTherefore, the probability that the system is in Maintaining exactly two hours from now is 0.56, or 56%.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward, but let me think again. Is there another way to model this, maybe using matrices or recursion?\n\nAlternatively, I could set up the transition matrix and raise it to the power of 2, then multiply by the initial state vector.\n\nThe transition matrix \\( T \\) would be:\n\n\\[\nT = \\begin{pmatrix}\n0.70 & 0.30 & 0 \\\\\n0.60 & 0.60 & 0.40 \\\\\n0.20 & 0.00 & 0.80\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nWait, no. Wait, the rows represent the current state, and the columns represent the next state. So, actually, it's:\n\nFrom Off:\n- To Off: 0.70\n- To Heating: 0.30\n- To Maintaining: 0.00\n\nFrom Heating:\n- To Off: 0.00\n- To Heating: 0.60\n- To Maintaining: 0.40\n\nFrom Maintaining:\n- To Off: 0.20\n- To Heating: 0.00\n- To Maintaining: 0.80\n\nSo, the transition matrix \\( T \\) is:\n\n\\[\nT = \\begin{pmatrix}\n0.70 & 0.30 & 0 \\\\\n0.00 & 0.60 & 0.40 \\\\\n0.20 & 0.00 & 0.80\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nThe initial state vector \\( S(0) \\) is:\n\n\\[\nS(0) = \\begin{pmatrix}\n0 \\\\\n1 \\\\\n0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nThen, \\( S(2) = S(0) \\times T^2 \\)\n\nCalculating \\( T^2 \\):\n\nLet me compute \\( T^2 = T \\times T \\).\n\nFirst, compute \\( T \\times T \\).\n\nCompute row by column.\n\nFirst row of T (Off):\n- Multiply with each column of T.\n\nFirst element (Off -> Off):\n0.70*0.70 + 0.30*0.00 + 0*0.20 = 0.49 + 0 + 0 = 0.49\n\nSecond element (Off -> Heating):\n0.70*0.30 + 0.30*0.60 + 0*0.00 = 0.21 + 0.18 + 0 = 0.39\n\nThird element (Off -> Maintaining):\n0.70*0 + 0.30*0.40 + 0*0.80 = 0 + 0.12 + 0 = 0.12\n\nSecond row of T (Heating):\n- Multiply with each column of T.\n\nFirst element (Heating -> Off):\n0.00*0.70 + 0.60*0.00 + 0.40*0.20 = 0 + 0 + 0.08 = 0.08\n\nSecond element (Heating -> Heating):\n0.00*0.30 + 0.60*0.60 + 0.40*0.00 = 0 + 0.36 + 0 = 0.36\n\nThird element (Heating -> Maintaining):\n0.00*0 + 0.60*0.40 + 0.40*0.80 = 0 + 0.24 + 0.32 = 0.56\n\nThird row of T (Maintaining):\n- Multiply with each column of T.\n\nFirst element (Maintaining -> Off):\n0.20*0.70 + 0.00*0.00 + 0.80*0.20 = 0.14 + 0 + 0.16 = 0.30\n\nSecond element (Maintaining -> Heating):\n0.20*0.30 + 0.00*0.60 + 0.80*0.00 = 0.06 + 0 + 0 = 0.06\n\nThird element (Maintaining -> Maintaining):\n0.20*0 + 0.00*0.60 + 0.80*0.80 = 0 + 0 + 0.64 = 0.64\n\nSo, \\( T^2 \\) is:\n\n\\[\nT^2 = \\begin{pmatrix}\n0.49 & 0.39 & 0.12 \\\\\n0.08 & 0.36 & 0.56 \\\\\n0.30 & 0.06 & 0.64\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nNow, \\( S(2) = S(0) \\times T^2 \\)\n\nSince \\( S(0) \\) is [0, 1, 0], multiplying it by \\( T^2 \\):\n\n- First element: 0*0.49 + 1*0.08 + 0*0.30 = 0.08\n- Second element: 0*0.39 + 1*0.36 + 0*0.06 = 0.36\n- Third element: 0*0.12 + 1*0.56 + 0*0.64 = 0.56\n\nSo, \\( S(2) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.08 & 0.36 & 0.56 \\end{pmatrix} \\)\n\nThus, the probability of being in Maintaining at \\( t = 2 \\) is 0.56, which matches my previous calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I could have used recursion or dynamic programming to compute the probabilities step by step, which is essentially what I did initially.

End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: A home water heating system switches between three states: 'Off', 'Heating', and 'Maintaining'. When the system is 'Off', there is a 30% chance it transitions to 'Heating' in a given hour (otherwise it stays 'Off'). When the system is 'Heating', there is a 40% chance it transitions to 'Maintaining' in a given hour (otherwise it stays 'Heating'). When the system is 'Maintaining', there is a 20% chance it transitions to 'Off' in a given hour (otherwise it stays 'Maintaining'). If the system is currently in the 'Heating' state, what is the probability that it will be in the 'Maintaining' state exactly 2 hours from now? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem about a home water heating system that can be in three states: Off, Heating, or Maintaining. The system transitions between these states with certain probabilities each hour. I need to find the probability that the system will be in the 'Maintaining' state exactly 2 hours from now, given that it's currently in the 'Heating' state.\n\nFirst, let me try to understand the transition probabilities. The problem states:\n\n- When the system is 'Off', there's a 30% chance it transitions to 'Heating' each hour. That means there's a 70% chance it stays 'Off'.\n\n- When it's 'Heating', there's a 40% chance it transitions to 'Maintaining' each hour, and a 60% chance it stays 'Heating'.\n\n- When it's 'Maintaining', there's a 20% chance it transitions to 'Off' each hour, and an 80% chance it stays 'Maintaining'.\n\nSo, the system can be modeled as a Markov chain with states Off (O), Heating (H), and Maintaining (M). The transition matrix would look like this:\n\n```\n          O      H      M\nO        0.7     0.3     0.0\nH        0.0     0.6     0.4\nM        0.2     0.0     0.8\n```\n\nWait, no, that doesn't look right. Let me double-check. When in Off (O), it can only transition to Heating (H) with 0.3 probability, so the row for O should be [0.7, 0.3, 0.0]. Similarly, when in Heating (H), it can transition to Maintaining (M) with 0.4, so the row for H is [0.0, 0.6, 0.4]. When in Maintaining (M), it can transition to Off with 0.2, so the row for M is [0.2, 0.0, 0.8].\n\nSo the transition matrix P is:\n\n```\nP = [ [0.7, 0.3, 0.0],\n       [0.0, 0.6, 0.4],\n       [0.2, 0.0, 0.8] ]\n```\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nNow, the system starts in state H (Heating). We need to find the probability that it's in state M exactly 2 hours from now. Since it's a Markov chain, the state at time t depends only on the state at time t-1.\n\nSo, we can model this as a two-step transition. Starting from H, after 1 hour, it can be in either H or M. Then, from those states, after another hour, it can transition again.\n\nLet me denote the state probabilities step by step.\n\nAt time t=0, the system is in H with probability 1.\n\nAt time t=1, the system can be in H or M.\n\nFrom H, the transition probabilities are 0.6 to stay in H and 0.4 to go to M.\n\nSo at t=1, the probability of being in H is 0.6, and in M is 0.4.\n\nNow, moving to t=2, we need to consider the transitions from both H and M.\n\nFrom H at t=1, it can stay in H with 0.6 or go to M with 0.4.\n\nFrom M at t=1, it can go back to Off with 0.2 or stay in M with 0.8.\n\nBut since we're only considering t=2, we can compute the probabilities as follows:\n\nAt t=2, the system can be in O, H, or M. However, since we're only interested in M at t=2, let's compute the probability of being in M at t=2.\n\nTo get to M at t=2, the system could have been in H at t=1 and then transitioned to M, or been in M at t=1 and stayed in M.\n\nSo, the probability P(M at t=2) is equal to:\n\nP(H at t=1) * P(H -> M) + P(M at t=1) * P(M -> M)\n\nFrom earlier, P(H at t=1) = 0.6, and P(M at t=1) = 0.4.\n\nFrom H to M, the probability is 0.4.\n\nFrom M to M, the probability is 0.8.\n\nSo, P(M at t=2) = (0.6 * 0.4) + (0.4 * 0.8) = 0.24 + 0.32 = 0.56.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should model the entire state probabilities step by step.\n\nAt t=0: [0, 1, 0] (probabilities for O, H, M)\n\nAfter 1 hour:\n\nFrom H, transitions: 0.6 to H, 0.4 to M.\n\nSo, t=1: [0, 0.6, 0.4]\n\nAfter 2 hours:\n\nFrom H (0.6): 0.6 to H, 0.4 to M.\n\nFrom M (0.4): 0.2 to O, 0.8 to M.\n\nSo, t=2:\n\nO: 0 (from H) + 0.4 * 0.2 = 0.08\n\nH: 0.6 * 0.6 = 0.36\n\nM: 0.6 * 0.4 + 0.4 * 0.8 = 0.24 + 0.32 = 0.56\n\nSo yes, the probability of being in M at t=2 is 0.56.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"exactly 2 hours from now\". So starting from t=0, after 2 hours, which is t=2.\n\nSo the answer is 0.56, which is 56%.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a possibility that the system could have transitioned to Off and then back to Maintaining? But no, because from Off, it can only go to Heating, not to Maintaining. So the only way to get to Maintaining at t=2 is either from Heating at t=1 or from Maintaining at t=1.\n\nYes, so the calculation seems correct.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this, we model the system as a Markov chain with states Off (O), Heating (H), and Maintaining (M). The transition matrix is:\n\n```\nP = [ [0.7, 0.3, 0.0],\n       [0.0, 0.6, 0.4],\n       [0.2, 0.0, 0.8] ]\n```\n\nStarting from H (probability 1 at t=0), we compute the state probabilities at t=1 and t=2.\n\nAt t=1:\n- P(H) = 0.6, P(M) = 0.4\n\nAt t=2:\n- From H: 0.6 * 0.6 = 0.36 to H, 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.24 to M\n- From M: 0.4 * 0.2 = 0.08 to O, 0.4 * 0.8 = 0.32 to M\n\nThus, P(M at t=2) = 0.24 + 0.32 = 0.56\n\nThe probability is 0.56.\n\nDONE."

The system transitions between these states with certain probabilities each hour. The question is asking: If the system is currently in the 'Heating' state, what's the probability that it will be in the 'Maintaining' state exactly 2 hours from now?\n\nHmm, okay. Let me break this down. It seems like a Markov chain problem because the system's current state only depends on its previous state, not on how it got there. So, I can model this using states and transition probabilities.\n\nFirst, let's list out the transition probabilities:\n\n1. **From 'Off':**\n   - 30% chance to transition to 'Heating'.\n   - 70% chance to stay in 'Off'.\n\n2. **From 'Heating':**\n   - 40% chance to transition to 'Maintaining'.\n   - 60% chance to stay in 'Heating'.\n\n3. **From 'Maintaining':**\n   - 20% chance to transition to 'Off'.\n   - 80% chance to stay in 'Maintaining'.\n\nGiven that the system is currently in 'Heating', I need to find the probability it's in 'Maintaining' after 2 hours. That means I need to consider all possible paths the system can take in 2 hours that end in 'Maintaining'.\n\nSince the system can only transition one state at a time each hour, I can model this by looking at the possible states after each hour and then the next hour.\n\nLet me visualize this step by step.\n\n**Current State:** Heating.\n\n**After 1 hour:**\nFrom Heating, there's a 40% chance to go to Maintaining and a 60% chance to stay in Heating.\n\nSo, after 1 hour, the probabilities are:\n- Maintaining: 40%\n- Heating: 60%\n\n**After 2 hours:**\nNow, we need to consider each possible state after 1 hour and where they can go in the second hour.\n\n1. **If after 1 hour it's in Maintaining (40%):**\n   - From Maintaining, 20% chance to go to Off.\n   - 80% chance to stay in Maintaining.\n\n   So, from Maintaining:\n   - Off: 20% * 40% = 8%\n   - Maintaining: 80% * 40% = 32%\n\n2. **If after 1 hour it's in Heating (60%):**\n   - From Heating, 40% to Maintaining, 60% to stay in Heating.\n\n   So, from Heating:\n   - Maintaining: 40% * 60% = 24%\n   - Heating: 60% * 60% = 36%\n\nNow, let's sum up the probabilities of being in Maintaining after 2 hours.\n\nFrom Maintaining after 1 hour: 32%\nFrom Heating after 1 hour: 24%\n\nTotal probability: 32% + 24% = 56%\n\nWait, is that right? Let me double-check.\n\nYes, after 2 hours, the system could have been in Maintaining after 1 hour and stayed there, or been in Heating after 1 hour and transitioned to Maintaining. So adding those two probabilities gives the total chance to be in Maintaining after 2 hours.\n\nSo, the probability is 56%.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations. Each step is just multiplying the transition probabilities and adding the relevant paths. So, yeah, 56% is the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe probability that the system will be in the 'Maintaining' state exactly 2 hours from now is 56%.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Current State:** The system is in 'Heating'.\n\n2. **After 1 Hour:**\n   - From 'Heating', 40% chance to transition to 'Maintaining'.\n   - 60% chance to remain in 'Heating'.\n   - Probabilities: 0.4 (Maintaining), 0.6 (Heating).\n\n3. **After 2 Hours:**\n   - **If in 'Maintaining' after 1 hour (40% chance):**\n     - 20% chance to transition to 'Off'.\n     - 80% chance to remain in 'Maintaining'.\n     - Probabilities: 0.4 * 0.2 = 0.08 (Off), 0.4 * 0.8 = 0.32 (Maintaining).\n   \n   - **If in 'Heating' after 1 hour (60% chance):**\n     - 40% chance to transition to 'Maintaining'.\n     - 60% chance to remain in 'Heating'.\n     - Probabilities: 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.24 (Maintaining), 0.6 * 0.6 = 0.36 (Heating).\n\n4. **Total Probability in 'Maintaining' after 2 hours:**\n   - From 'Maintaining': 0.32\n   - From 'Heating': 0.24\n   - Total: 0.32 + 0.24 = 0.56 (56%).\n\n**Answer:** The probability is 56%.\n\nDONE."

If the system is currently in the 'Heating' state, what is the probability that it will be in the 'Maintaining' state exactly 2 hours from now? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this problem about a home water heating system that can be in one of three states: 'Off', 'Heating', or 'Maintaining'. The system transitions between these states with certain probabilities each hour. The question is asking: if the system is currently in the 'Heating' state, what is the probability that it will be in the 'Maintaining' state exactly 2 hours from now?\n\nHmm, okay, let's break this down. First, I need to model the system's state transitions. It seems like a Markov chain problem because the system's next state only depends on its current state, not on the sequence of events that preceded it.\n\nSo, the system has three states: Off, Heating, and Maintaining. Let me denote these as O, H, and M for simplicity. The transition probabilities are given as:\n\n- From Off:\n  - 30% chance to transition to Heating (H)\n  - 70% chance to stay in Off (O)\n\n- From Heating:\n  - 40% chance to transition to Maintaining (M)\n  - 60% chance to stay in Heating (H)\n\n- From Maintaining:\n  - 20% chance to transition to Off (O)\n  - 80% chance to stay in Maintaining (M)\n\nThe problem is asking for the probability that the system will be in state M exactly 2 hours from now, given that it's currently in state H.\n\nSo, we need to compute the probability of being in M after 2 hours, starting from H. Since the system transitions each hour, after 2 hours, it will have gone through two transitions.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. One approach is to consider all possible paths the system can take from H over 2 hours that end in M.\n\nEach transition can be represented as a step, and since the system can stay in the same state, each step has a probability of staying or moving to another state.\n\nSince we're dealing with two steps, we'll have to consider all possible sequences of states over those two steps that result in the system being in M.\n\nLet's list out all possible paths from H over 2 hours that end in M.\n\nFirst, starting at H:\n\n1. After 1 hour:\n   - From H, it can either stay in H or transition to M.\n   - So, after 1 hour, the system can be in H or M.\n\n2. After 2 hours:\n   - If it was in H after 1 hour, it can either stay in H or transition to M.\n   - If it was in M after 1 hour, it can either stay in M or transition to O.\n\nBut wait, we want to end up in M after 2 hours. So, we need to consider all paths that lead to M after two steps.\n\nLet's enumerate all possible paths:\n\nPath 1:\n- H \u2192 H \u2192 M\n\nPath 2:\n- H \u2192 M \u2192 M\n\nSo, these are the two possible paths that end in M after two steps.\n\nNow, let's compute the probabilities for each path.\n\nStarting with Path 1: H \u2192 H \u2192 M\n\n- First step: From H, probability to stay in H is 60%, so 0.6.\n- Second step: From H again, probability to transition to M is 40%, so 0.4.\n- Therefore, the probability for this path is 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.24.\n\nPath 2: H \u2192 M \u2192 M\n\n- First step: From H, probability to transition to M is 40%, so 0.4.\n- Second step: From M, probability to stay in M is 80%, so 0.8.\n- Therefore, the probability for this path is 0.4 * 0.8 = 0.32.\n\nNow, since these two paths are mutually exclusive (they can't happen at the same time), we can add their probabilities to get the total probability of being in M after two hours.\n\nTotal probability = Path 1 + Path 2 = 0.24 + 0.32 = 0.56.\n\nSo, the probability is 0.56, or 56%.\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I haven't missed any paths.\n\nIs there another path from H that ends in M after two hours? Let's see:\n\nStarting at H:\n\nAfter 1 hour:\n- In H with probability 0.6\n- In M with probability 0.4\n\nAfter 2 hours:\n- If in H, can go to H or M.\n- If in M, can go to M or O.\n\nBut we only care about ending in M, so:\n\nFrom H after 1 hour:\n- To M: 0.4\n- To H: 0.6\n\nFrom M after 1 hour:\n- To M: 0.8\n- To O: 0.2\n\nSo, to end in M after two hours, the possible transitions are:\n\n1. H \u2192 H \u2192 M: 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.24\n2. H \u2192 M \u2192 M: 0.4 * 0.8 = 0.32\n3. H \u2192 M \u2192 M (but that's the same as path 2)\n\nWait, no, that's all. There's no other way to get to M after two steps from H. Because if you go H \u2192 M \u2192 O, you end up in O, which isn't M. Similarly, H \u2192 H \u2192 H is H, not M. So, yes, only two paths.\n\nTherefore, the total probability is 0.24 + 0.32 = 0.56.\n\nExpressed as a fraction, 0.56 is 14/25, but it's probably better to leave it as a decimal unless specified otherwise.\n\nAlternatively, we can model this using transition matrices or probability vectors.\n\nLet me try that approach to confirm.\n\nDefine the state vector as [O, H, M]. Initially, since we're starting at H, the initial state vector is [0, 1, 0].\n\nThe transition matrix P is:\n\nFrom Off: [0.7, 0.3, 0]\nFrom Heating: [0, 0.6, 0.4]\nFrom Maintaining: [0.2, 0, 0.8]\n\nSo, P = [\n [0.7, 0.3, 0],\n [0, 0.6, 0.4],\n [0.2, 0, 0.8]\n]\n\nWe need to compute the state vector after two transitions, starting from H.\n\nThis can be done by multiplying the initial state vector by P^2.\n\nLet me compute P^2.\n\nFirst, compute P squared:\n\nP^2 = P * P\n\nLet me compute each element of P^2.\n\nRow 1 of P: [0.7, 0.3, 0]\nColumn 1 of P: [0.7, 0, 0.2]\nColumn 2 of P: [0.3, 0.6, 0]\nColumn 3 of P: [0, 0.4, 0.8]\n\nSo, first row of P^2:\n\n(0.7*0.7) + (0.3*0) + (0*0.2) = 0.49 + 0 + 0 = 0.49\n\n(0.7*0.3) + (0.3*0.6) + (0*0) = 0.21 + 0.18 + 0 = 0.39\n\n(0.7*0) + (0.3*0.4) + (0*0.8) = 0 + 0.12 + 0 = 0.12\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Actually, to compute P^2, each element (i,j) is the dot product of row i of P and column j of P.\n\nSo, let's correct that.\n\nCompute P^2:\n\nFirst row of P: [0.7, 0.3, 0]\nFirst column of P: [0.7, 0, 0.2]\nSo, (1,1): 0.7*0.7 + 0.3*0 + 0*0.2 = 0.49 + 0 + 0 = 0.49\n\n(1,2): 0.7*0.3 + 0.3*0.6 + 0*0 = 0.21 + 0.18 + 0 = 0.39\n\n(1,3): 0.7*0 + 0.3*0.4 + 0*0.8 = 0 + 0.12 + 0 = 0.12\n\nSecond row of P: [0, 0.6, 0.4]\nSecond column of P: [0.3, 0.6, 0]\nSo, (2,1): 0*0.7 + 0.6*0 + 0.4*0.2 = 0 + 0 + 0.08 = 0.08\n\n(2,2): 0*0.3 + 0.6*0.6 + 0.4*0 = 0 + 0.36 + 0 = 0.36\n\n(2,3): 0*0 + 0.6*0.4 + 0.4*0.8 = 0 + 0.24 + 0.32 = 0.56\n\nThird row of P: [0.2, 0, 0.8]\nThird column of P: [0, 0.4, 0.8]\nSo, (3,1): 0.2*0.7 + 0*0 + 0.8*0.2 = 0.14 + 0 + 0.16 = 0.30\n\n(3,2): 0.2*0.3 + 0*0.6 + 0.8*0 = 0.06 + 0 + 0 = 0.06\n\n(3,3): 0.2*0 + 0*0.4 + 0.8*0.8 = 0 + 0 + 0.64 = 0.64\n\nSo, P^2 is:\n\n[\n [0.49, 0.39, 0.12],\n [0.08, 0.36, 0.56],\n [0.30, 0.06, 0.64]\n]\n\nNow, the initial state vector is [0, 1, 0]. Multiplying this by P^2 gives the state vector after two hours.\n\nSo, the resulting state vector is:\n\n[0, 1, 0] * P^2 = [0*0.49 + 1*0.08 + 0*0.30, 0*0.39 + 1*0.36 + 0*0.06, 0*0.12 + 1*0.56 + 0*0.64] = [0.08, 0.36, 0.56]\n\nSo, the probability of being in M after two hours is 0.56.\n\nThis matches the earlier result we got by enumerating the paths.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 0.56.\n\nAlternatively, as a fraction, 0.56 is 14/25, but it's more precise to present it as 0.56 unless specified otherwise.\n\nSo, the final answer is 0.56.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the probability that the heating system will be in the 'Maintaining' state exactly 2 hours from now, we analyze the possible state transitions over two hours. The system can transition as follows:\n\n1. From 'Heating' (H), it can stay in H with 60% probability or transition to M with 40% probability.\n2. If it transitions to M, it can stay in M with 80% probability or transition back to O with 20% probability.\n\nWe consider all paths that end in M after two hours:\n\n- Path 1: H \u2192 H \u2192 M\n  - Probability: 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.24\n- Path 2: H \u2192 M \u2192 M\n  - Probability: 0.4 * 0.8 = 0.32\n\nAdding these probabilities gives the total probability of being in M after two hours:\n\n0.24 + 0.32 = 0.56\n\nThus, the probability is 0.56.\n\nDONE."

End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: A home water heating system switches between three states: 'Off', 'Heating', and 'Maintaining'. When the system is 'Off', there is a 30% chance it transitions to 'Heating' in a given hour (otherwise it stays 'Off'). When the system is 'Heating', there is a 40% chance it transitions to 'Maintaining' in a given hour (otherwise it stays 'Heating'). When the system is 'Maintaining', there is a 20% chance it transitions to 'Off' in a given hour (otherwise it stays 'Maintaining'). If the system is currently in the 'Heating' state, what is the probability that it will be in the 'Maintaining' state exactly 2 hours from now? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out the probability that a home water heating system will be in the 'Maintaining' state exactly 2 hours from now, given that it's currently in the 'Heating' state. Hmm, okay, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. The system can be in one of three states: 'Off', 'Heating', or 'Maintaining'. Each hour, it has a certain probability of transitioning between these states. Specifically:\n\n- **When Off**: 30% chance to transition to 'Heating'; 70% chance to stay 'Off'.\n- **When Heating**: 40% chance to transition to 'Maintaining'; 60% chance to stay 'Heating'.\n- **When Maintaining**: 20% chance to transition to 'Off'; 80% chance to stay 'Maintaining'.\n\nThe question is asking, if the system is currently in 'Heating', what's the probability it will be in 'Maintaining' exactly 2 hours from now. So, I need to model the system's state transitions over two hours and find the probability of being in 'Maintaining' at that point.\n\nSince the system can be in one of three states each hour, and transitions depend only on the current state, this seems like a Markov process. The probability of being in a particular state at the next step depends only on the current state, not on the history.\n\nLet me represent the states as variables:\n\n- Let \\( M_t \\) be the probability of being in 'Maintaining' at time \\( t \\).\n- Let \\( H_t \\) be the probability of being in 'Heating' at time \\( t \\).\n- Let \\( O_t \\) be the probability of being in 'Off' at time \\( t \\).\n\nGiven that the system is currently in 'Heating', that means \\( H_0 = 1 \\) (since probabilities sum to 1, \\( M_0 = 0 \\), \\( O_0 = 0 \\)).\n\nWe need to find \\( M_2 \\), the probability of being in 'Maintaining' at time \\( t = 2 \\).\n\nTo find \\( M_2 \\), I can model the transitions step by step, either recursively or by building a transition matrix.\n\n**Step-by-Step Approach:**\n\n1. **From 'Heating' (\\( H_t \\)):**\n   - 40% chance to go to 'Maintaining'.\n   - 60% chance to stay in 'Heating'.\n\n2. **From 'Maintaining' (\\( M_t \\)):**\n   - 20% chance to go to 'Off'.\n   - 80% chance to stay in 'Maintaining'.\n\n3. **From 'Off' (\\( O_t \\)):**\n   - 30% chance to go to 'Heating'.\n   - 70% chance to stay in 'Off'.\n\nGiven that we're starting at \\( t = 0 \\), \\( H_0 = 1 \\), \\( M_0 = 0 \\), \\( O_0 = 0 \\).\n\nLet's compute \\( t = 1 \\) first.\n\nAt \\( t = 1 \\):\n\n- \\( H_1 \\) depends on the previous state. Since at \\( t = 0 \\), the system was in 'Heating', it can either stay in 'Heating' or transition to 'Maintaining'.\n\nWait, no. Actually, to compute \\( H_1 \\), \\( M_1 \\), and \\( O_1 \\), we need to consider all possible transitions from the previous state.\n\nBut since at \\( t = 0 \\), the system is definitely in 'Heating', we can compute the probabilities for \\( t = 1 \\) based on that.\n\nBut actually, for \\( t = 1 \\), the system can be in 'Heating', 'Maintaining', or 'Off' based on the transition probabilities.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model this with equations.\n\nLet me define the transition probabilities as follows:\n\n- From 'Heating' (\\( H \\)):\n  - To 'Maintaining' (\\( M \\)): 0.4\n  - To 'Heating' (\\( H \\)): 0.6\n\n- From 'Maintaining' (\\( M \\)):\n  - To 'Off' (\\( O \\)): 0.2\n  - To 'Maintaining' (\\( M \\)): 0.8\n\n- From 'Off' (\\( O \\)):\n  - To 'Heating' (\\( H \\)): 0.3\n  - To 'Off' (\\( O \\)): 0.7\n\nNow, let's denote the state probabilities at time \\( t \\) as \\( [M_t, H_t, O_t] \\).\n\nGiven that at \\( t = 0 \\), the system is in 'Heating', so \\( [M_0, H_0, O_0] = [0, 1, 0] \\).\n\nWe need to compute \\( [M_2, H_2, O_2] \\).\n\nLet me compute \\( t = 1 \\) first.\n\nAt \\( t = 1 \\):\n\n- \\( M_1 \\) comes from transitions from 'Heating' and 'Maintaining' in the previous step.\n\nBut at \\( t = 0 \\), the system was in 'Heating', so:\n\n- \\( M_1 \\) can only come from 'Heating' transitioning to 'Maintaining': \\( 1 \\times 0.4 = 0.4 \\)\n\n- \\( H_1 \\) can come from 'Heating' staying in 'Heating' and from 'Maintaining' transitioning to 'Heating' (but at \\( t=0 \\), it was in 'Heating', so 'Maintaining' wasn't possible). Wait, no.\n\nWait, at \\( t=0 \\), the system is in 'Heating', so:\n\n- \\( M_1 \\) comes only from 'Heating' transitioning to 'Maintaining': 0.4\n\n- \\( H_1 \\) comes from 'Heating' staying in 'Heating': 0.6\n\n- \\( O_1 \\) comes from 'Heating' transitioning to 'Off': but there's no transition from 'Heating' to 'Off', only from 'Maintaining' to 'Off'.\n\nWait, hold on. The transition probabilities are:\n\n- From 'Heating', it can go to 'Maintaining' (40%) or stay in 'Heating' (60%).\n\n- From 'Maintaining', it can go to 'Off' (20%) or stay in 'Maintaining' (80%).\n\n- From 'Off', it can go to 'Heating' (30%) or stay in 'Off' (70%).\n\nSo, at \\( t=1 \\):\n\n- \\( M_1 \\) can come from 'Heating' transitioning to 'Maintaining': 1 * 0.4 = 0.4\n\n- \\( H_1 \\) can come from 'Heating' staying in 'Heating': 1 * 0.6 = 0.6\n\n- \\( O_1 \\) can come from 'Maintaining' transitioning to 'Off': but at \\( t=0 \\), the system wasn't in 'Maintaining', so \\( O_1 = 0 \\) in this case. Wait, no. At \\( t=0 \\), the system is in 'Heating', so \\( O_1 \\) can only come from transitions from 'Heating' or 'Maintaining' in the previous step. But since at \\( t=0 \\), it's in 'Heating', the only way to get to 'Off' at \\( t=1 \\) is if it transitions from 'Heating' to 'Off', but according to the problem, when 'Heating', it can only go to 'Maintaining' or stay in 'Heating'. It doesn't have a direct transition to 'Off'. So, actually, from 'Heating', it cannot go to 'Off' directly. So, \\( O_1 = 0 \\) because there's no way to get to 'Off' in one step from 'Heating'.\n\nWait, that seems off. Let me clarify:\n\nLooking back at the problem statement:\n\n- When the system is 'Off', there's a 30% chance to transition to 'Heating' and 70% to stay 'Off'.\n\n- When it's 'Heating', 40% to 'Maintaining', 60% to stay 'Heating'.\n\n- When it's 'Maintaining', 20% to 'Off', 80% to stay 'Maintaining'.\n\nSo, transitions:\n\n- From 'Heating', it can only go to 'Maintaining' or stay in 'Heating'; no direct transition to 'Off'.\n\n- From 'Maintaining', it can go to 'Off' or stay in 'Maintaining'.\n\n- From 'Off', it can go to 'Heating' or stay 'Off'.\n\nTherefore, at \\( t=1 \\):\n\n- \\( M_1 \\): comes only from 'Heating' transitioning to 'Maintaining': 1 * 0.4 = 0.4\n\n- \\( H_1 \\): comes from 'Heating' staying in 'Heating': 1 * 0.6 = 0.6\n\n- \\( O_1 \\): comes from 'Maintaining' transitioning to 'Off', but at \\( t=0 \\), it was in 'Heating', so \\( O_1 = 0 \\) because 'Heating' cannot transition to 'Off' directly.\n\nWait, that can't be right because from 'Heating' you can't go to 'Off', but from 'Maintaining' you can. But at \\( t=0 \\), it's in 'Heating', so \\( O_1 \\) must be 0 because you can only get to 'Off' from 'Maintaining', and since at \\( t=0 \\) it's not in 'Maintaining', \\( O_1 = 0 \\).\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because at \\( t=0 \\), it's in 'Heating', so to get to 'Off' at \\( t=1 \\), it would have to transition from 'Heating' to 'Off', but according to the problem, when it's 'Heating', it can only transition to 'Maintaining' or stay 'Heating'. So, it cannot transition to 'Off' from 'Heating'. Therefore, \\( O_1 = 0 \\).\n\nSo, at \\( t=1 \\):\n\n- \\( M_1 = 0.4 \\)\n\n- \\( H_1 = 0.6 \\)\n\n- \\( O_1 = 0 \\)\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because from 'Heating', you can't go to 'Off', but from 'Maintaining', you can. But at \\( t=0 \\), the system is in 'Heating', so \\( O_1 \\) can only come from 'Heating' transitioning to 'Off', which isn't possible. Therefore, \\( O_1 = 0 \\).\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. If at \\( t=0 \\), the system is in 'Heating', then at \\( t=1 \\), it can only be in 'Heating' or 'Maintaining', because from 'Heating' it can only go to 'Maintaining' or stay. Therefore, \\( O_1 = 0 \\) because it cannot transition to 'Off' in one step.\n\nTherefore, at \\( t=1 \\):\n\n- \\( M_1 = 0.4 \\)\n\n- \\( H_1 = 0.6 \\)\n\n- \\( O_1 = 0 \\)\n\nNow, let's move to \\( t=2 \\).\n\nAt \\( t=2 \\), we need to compute \\( M_2 \\), which depends on the state at \\( t=1 \\).\n\nFrom \\( t=1 \\), the system can be in 'Heating' (0.6), 'Maintaining' (0.4), or 'Off' (0). So, we need to consider transitions from each of these states.\n\nBut wait, at \\( t=1 \\), \\( O_1 = 0 \\), so we don't need to consider transitions from 'Off' for \\( t=2 \\).\n\nTherefore, to compute \\( M_2 \\):\n\n- From 'Heating' (\\( H_1 = 0.6 \\)): 40% chance to go to 'Maintaining', so contributes \\( 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.24 \\)\n\n- From 'Maintaining' (\\( M_1 = 0.4 \\)): 80% chance to stay in 'Maintaining', so contributes \\( 0.4 * 0.8 = 0.32 \\)\n\n- From 'Off' (\\( O_1 = 0 \\)): 20% chance to go to 'Maintaining', but since \\( O_1 = 0 \\), this contributes 0.\n\nTherefore, \\( M_2 = 0.24 + 0.32 + 0 = 0.56 \\)\n\nSimilarly, we can compute \\( H_2 \\) and \\( O_2 \\) if needed, but the question only asks for \\( M_2 \\).\n\nWait, let me double-check.\n\nAt \\( t=1 \\):\n\n- \\( M_1 = 0.4 \\)\n\n- \\( H_1 = 0.6 \\)\n\n- \\( O_1 = 0 \\)\n\nAt \\( t=2 \\):\n\n- \\( M_2 \\) comes from:\n\n  - 'Heating' at \\( t=1 \\) transitioning to 'Maintaining': \\( 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.24 \\)\n\n  - 'Maintaining' at \\( t=1 \\) staying in 'Maintaining': \\( 0.4 * 0.8 = 0.32 \\)\n\n  - 'Off' at \\( t=1 \\) transitioning to 'Maintaining': \\( 0 * 0.2 = 0 \\)\n\nSo, total \\( M_2 = 0.24 + 0.32 = 0.56 \\)\n\nSimilarly, \\( H_2 \\) would come from:\n\n- 'Heating' staying: \\( 0.6 * 0.6 = 0.36 \\)\n\n- 'Maintaining' transitioning to 'Heating': \\( 0.4 * 0 = 0 \\) (since from 'Maintaining', it can't go to 'Heating' directly; it can only go to 'Off' or stay in 'Maintaining')\n\nWait, no. From 'Maintaining', it can only go to 'Off' or stay in 'Maintaining', not to 'Heating'. So, \\( H_2 \\) only comes from 'Heating' staying: \\( 0.6 * 0.6 = 0.36 \\)\n\nSimilarly, \\( O_2 \\) comes from:\n\n- 'Maintaining' transitioning to 'Off': \\( 0.4 * 0.2 = 0.08 \\)\n\n- 'Off' staying: \\( 0 * 0.7 = 0 \\)\n\nSo, \\( O_2 = 0.08 \\)\n\nLet me verify if the probabilities sum to 1:\n\n\\( M_2 + H_2 + O_2 = 0.56 + 0.36 + 0.08 = 1.0 \\), which is good.\n\nTherefore, the probability of being in 'Maintaining' exactly 2 hours from now is 0.56.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the transitions.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to model it as a transition matrix and raise it to the power of 2, then multiply by the initial state vector.\n\nLet me define the transition matrix \\( P \\) where rows are current states and columns are next states.\n\nStates are: Off (O), Heating (H), Maintaining (M). Let's assign indices: O=0, H=1, M=2.\n\nThe transition matrix \\( P \\) will have entries \\( P(i,j) \\) representing the probability of transitioning from state \\( i \\) to state \\( j \\) in one hour.\n\nFrom the problem:\n\n- From O (0):\n\n  - To H (1): 0.3\n\n  - To O (0): 0.7\n\n- From H (1):\n\n  - To M (2): 0.4\n\n  - To H (1): 0.6\n\n- From M (2):\n\n  - To O (0): 0.2\n\n  - To M (2): 0.8\n\nSo, the transition matrix \\( P \\) is:\n\n\\[\nP = \\begin{bmatrix}\n0.7 & 0.3 & 0 \\\\\n0.6 & 0.6 & 0.4 \\\\\n0.2 & 0 & 0.8 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nThe initial state vector \\( \\pi_0 \\) is [0, 1, 0], since the system is in 'Heating' (state H).\n\nWe need to find \\( \\pi_2 = \\pi_0 \\times P^2 \\), which will give us the state probabilities after 2 hours.\n\nFirst, let's compute \\( P^2 \\).\n\nCalculating \\( P^2 = P \\times P \\):\n\nCompute each element:\n\nLet me denote rows as current state and columns as next state.\n\nCompute \\( P^2(0,0) \\):\n\n- Row 0 of P: [0.7, 0.3, 0]\n\n- Column 0 of P: [0.7, 0.6, 0.2]\n\nSo, \\( P^2(0,0) = (0.7)(0.7) + (0.3)(0.6) + (0)(0.2) = 0.49 + 0.18 + 0 = 0.67 \\)\n\nSimilarly, \\( P^2(0,1) \\):\n\n- Row 0: [0.7, 0.3, 0]\n\n- Column 1: [0.3, 0.6, 0]\n\n= 0.7*0.3 + 0.3*0.6 + 0*0 = 0.21 + 0.18 + 0 = 0.39\n\n\\( P^2(0,2) \\):\n\n- Row 0: [0.7, 0.3, 0]\n\n- Column 2: [0, 0.4, 0.8]\n\n= 0.7*0 + 0.3*0.4 + 0*0.8 = 0 + 0.12 + 0 = 0.12\n\nSimilarly, \\( P^2(1,0) \\):\n\n- Row 1: [0.6, 0.6, 0.4]\n\n- Column 0: [0.7, 0.6, 0.2]\n\n= 0.6*0.7 + 0.6*0.6 + 0.4*0.2 ="

Since each hour is independent, I can model this as a Markov chain with transitions happening each hour.\n\nLet me outline the transition probabilities:\n\n- From 'Heating':\n  - 40% chance to stay in 'Heating' (i.e., transitions to 'Heating').\n  - 60% chance to transition to 'Maintaining'.\n\n- From 'Maintaining':\n  - 80% chance to stay in 'Maintaining'.\n  - 20% chance to transition to 'Off'.\n\n- From 'Off':\n  - 30% chance to transition to 'Heating'.\n  - 70% chance to stay in 'Off'.\n\nBut since we're starting from 'Heating', and we need to find the probability of being in 'Maintaining' exactly two hours from now, I can ignore the 'Off' state for the first transition. However, the 'Off' state might come into play if the system transitions there in the first hour.\n\nWait, actually, no. If the system transitions to 'Off' in the first hour, then in the second hour, it will have a chance to transition back to 'Heating' or stay 'Off'. So I need to consider all possible paths that lead to 'Maintaining' after two hours.\n\nLet me consider the possible paths:\n\n1. From 'Heating' -> 'Heating' -> 'Maintaining'\n2. From 'Heating' -> 'Maintaining' -> 'Maintaining'\n3. From 'Heating' -> 'Maintaining' -> 'Off'\n4. From 'Heating' -> 'Heating' -> 'Heating'\n\nWait, no, the third path leads to 'Off', which isn't 'Maintaining', so it's irrelevant. Similarly, the fourth path stays in 'Heating', so it doesn't lead to 'Maintaining' either. So actually, only the first two paths matter.\n\nWait, let me think again. If in the first hour, the system stays in 'Heating', then in the second hour, it can either stay or transition to 'Maintaining'. If in the first hour, it transitions to 'Maintaining', then in the second hour, it can either stay in 'Maintaining' or transition back to 'Heating' or 'Off'.\n\nBut we only care about the state after two hours, so we need to consider all possible paths that end in 'Maintaining'.\n\nLet me list all possible two-step transitions:\n\n- Start at 'Heating'.\n\nFirst hour:\n\n- 0.6 chance to stay in 'Heating'.\n- 0.4 chance to transition to 'Maintaining'.\n\nIf it stays in 'Heating' (0.6), then in the second hour:\n\n- 0.6 chance to stay in 'Heating'.\n- 0.4 chance to transition to 'Maintaining'.\n\nIf it transitions to 'Maintaining' (0.4), then in the second hour:\n\n- 0.8 chance to stay in 'Maintaining'.\n- 0.2 chance to transition to 'Off'.\n\nSo, the paths that lead to 'Maintaining' after two hours are:\n\n1. Heating -> Heating -> Maintaining\n2. Heating -> Maintaining -> Maintaining\n\nAdditionally, there's a path where it goes to 'Maintaining' in the first hour and then transitions back to 'Heating' in the second hour, but that doesn't end in 'Maintaining'. Similarly, if it goes to 'Off' in the second hour, that also doesn't end in 'Maintaining'.\n\nSo, the total probability is the sum of the probabilities of these two paths.\n\nLet me calculate each path:\n\n1. Heating -> Heating -> Maintaining:\n\nProbability = 0.6 (first hour stays in Heating) * 0.4 (second hour transitions to Maintaining) = 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.24\n\n2. Heating -> Maintaining -> Maintaining:\n\nProbability = 0.4 (first hour transitions to Maintaining) * 0.8 (second hour stays in Maintaining) = 0.4 * 0.8 = 0.32\n\nAdding these together: 0.24 + 0.32 = 0.56\n\nWait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check if I missed any other paths.\n\nIs there a path where it goes to 'Maintaining' in the first hour and then back to 'Heating' in the second hour, but then somehow back to 'Maintaining' again? No, because after two hours, we're only considering the state after two hours. So if it transitions to 'Heating' in the second hour, it's not in 'Maintaining' anymore.\n\nSimilarly, if it transitions to 'Off' in the second hour, it's not in 'Maintaining'.\n\nTherefore, the only paths that result in 'Maintaining' after two hours are the two I considered.\n\nSo the total probability is 0.56.\n\nWait, but let me think about the transitions again. When in 'Heating', 60% stay, 40% go to 'Maintaining'. When in 'Maintaining', 80% stay, 20% go to 'Off'.\n\nSo from 'Heating', after one hour:\n\n- 0.6 Heating\n- 0.4 Maintaining\n\nFrom 'Maintaining', after one hour:\n\n- 0.8 Maintaining\n- 0.2 Off\n\nFrom 'Off', after one hour:\n\n- 0.3 Heating\n- 0.7 Off\n\nBut since we're starting from 'Heating', we can ignore 'Off' in the first hour. However, in the second hour, if it went to 'Maintaining' in the first hour, it can go to 'Maintaining' or 'Off'. If it went to 'Heating' again, it can go to 'Heating' or 'Maintaining'.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model this as a two-step Markov chain.\n\nLet me define the states as H (Heating), M (Maintaining), and O (Off).\n\nStarting from H.\n\nAfter one hour:\n\n- H: 0.6\n- M: 0.4\n- O: 0 (since from H, can't go to O directly; only to H or M)\n\nAfter two hours:\n\nFrom the state after one hour, which is either H or M.\n\nIf it's H after first hour (prob 0.6):\n\n- H: 0.6\n- M: 0.4\n\nIf it's M after first hour (prob 0.4):\n\n- M: 0.8\n- O: 0.2\n\nSo, the total probability of being in M after two hours is:\n\nP(H -> H -> M) + P(H -> M -> M)\n\n= (0.6 * 0.4) + (0.4 * 0.8)\n\n= 0.24 + 0.32\n\n= 0.56\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 0.56.\n\nBut wait, let me consider another approach to confirm.\n\nAlternative approach: Use transition matrices.\n\nDefine the transition matrix P:\n\nFrom H:\n\n- To H: 0.6\n- To M: 0.4\n- To O: 0\n\nFrom M:\n\n- To H: 0 (since from M, it can only go to M or O)\n- To M: 0.8\n- To O: 0.2\n\nFrom O:\n\n- To H: 0.3\n- To M: 0 (since from O, it can only go to H or O)\n- To O: 0.7\n\nSo the transition matrix P is:\n\n[ [0.6, 0, 0],\n  [0.4, 0.8, 0.2],\n  [0, 0.3, 0.7] ]\n\nBut since we start from H, the initial state vector is [1, 0, 0].\n\nAfter one hour, the state vector is:\n\n[0.6, 0.4, 0]\n\nAfter two hours, we multiply by P again:\n\n[0.6, 0, 0]   [0.6, 0.4, 0]\n[0.4, 0.8, 0.2] [0.6, 0.4, 0]\n\nWait, actually, it's:\n\nAfter first hour: [0.6, 0.4, 0]\n\nThen, multiply by P:\n\nM = [0.6, 0.4, 0] * P\n\nBut in matrix multiplication, it's rows of P multiplied by the column vector.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to think in terms of state transitions.\n\nAfter first hour: state is H with 0.6, M with 0.4.\n\nAfter second hour:\n\nFrom H (0.6):\n\n- To H: 0.6 * 0.6 = 0.36\n- To M: 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.24\n\nFrom M (0.4):\n\n- To H: 0.4 * 0 = 0\n- To M: 0.4 * 0.8 = 0.32\n- To O: 0.4 * 0.2 = 0.08\n\nSo total:\n\nH: 0.36 + 0 = 0.36\n\nM: 0.24 + 0.32 = 0.56\n\nO: 0.08\n\nTherefore, the probability of being in M is 0.56, same as before.\n\nYes, that confirms it.\n\nSo, the probability is 0.56, or 56%.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 0.56.\n</think>\n\nThe probability that the system will be in the 'Maintaining' state exactly two hours from now is 0.56.\n\nDONE."
