  "question": "A home water heating system switches between three states: 'Off', 'Heating', and 'Maintaining'. When the system is 'Off', there is a 30% chance it transitions to 'Heating' in a given hour (otherwise it stays 'Off'). When the system is 'Heating', there is a 40% chance it transitions to 'Maintaining' in a given hour (otherwise it stays 'Heating'). When the system is 'Maintaining', there is a 20% chance it transitions to 'Off' in a given hour (otherwise it stays 'Maintaining'). If the system is currently in the 'Heating' state, what is the probability that it will be in the 'Maintaining' state exactly 2 hours from now?",
  "answer": "This problem involves a Markov process, where the future state depends only on the current state and not on the sequence of states that preceded it.\n\nLet's work step by step:\n\n1) We need to find the probability that the system goes from 'Heating' to 'Maintaining' in exactly 2 hours.\n\n2) Let's consider all possible paths from 'Heating' to 'Maintaining' that take exactly 2 hours:\n\n   Path 1: Heating \u2192 Heating \u2192 Maintaining\n   Path 2: Heating \u2192 Maintaining \u2192 Maintaining\n\n3) Let's calculate the probability of each path:\n\n   Path 1: P(Heating \u2192 Heating \u2192 Maintaining)\n   = P(Heating \u2192 Heating) \u00d7 P(Heating \u2192 Maintaining)\n   = 0.6 \u00d7 0.4 = 0.24\n   \n   Path 2: P(Heating \u2192 Maintaining \u2192 Maintaining)\n   = P(Heating \u2192 Maintaining) \u00d7 P(Maintaining \u2192 Maintaining)\n   = 0.4 \u00d7 0.8 = 0.32\n\n4) The total probability is the sum of the probabilities of all possible paths:\n   \n   P(Heating to Maintaining in exactly 2 hours) = 0.24 + 0.32 = 0.56 or 56%\n\nTherefore, if the system is currently in the 'Heating' state, there is a 56% probability that it will be in the 'Maintaining' state exactly 2 hours from now."
