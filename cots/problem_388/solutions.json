Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.\n\nThe problem says: Consider a positive integer n. If we know that n is divisible by 6 but not divisible by 8, which of the following statements must be true? Then it gives five options labeled 1 through 5.\n\nOkay, so I need to determine which of these statements are necessarily true given that n is divisible by 6 but not by 8. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, let's recall what it means for a number to be divisible by 6 and not by 8. If a number is divisible by 6, it means it's a multiple of 6. So, n can be written as 6k, where k is some positive integer. But it's also given that n is not divisible by 8, which means when you divide n by 8, it doesn't come out evenly. So, 8 doesn't divide 6k.\n\nNow, let's look at each of the statements one by one and see if they must be true based on this information.\n\n**Statement 1: n is divisible by 3.**\n\nWell, 6 is 2 times 3, so any multiple of 6 must also be a multiple of 3. That makes sense because 6k is 3*(2k), so it's clear that n is divisible by 3. Therefore, Statement 1 must be true.\n\n**Statement 2: n is divisible by 2.**\n\nSimilarly, since 6 is 2 times 3, any multiple of 6 is also even. That means n is divisible by 2. So, Statement 2 must be true as well.\n\n**Statement 3: n is divisible by 4.**\n\nHmm, this one is trickier. Let's think about it. If n is divisible by 6, it's 6k. But 6k can be written as 2*3k. For n to be divisible by 4, it needs to have at least two factors of 2, right? So, 6k has one factor of 2, but if k has another factor of 2, then 6k would have two factors of 2, making it divisible by 4.\n\nWait, but n is not divisible by 8. Let's see. If n were divisible by 8, then 8 divides 6k, which would imply that 6k is a multiple of 8. But since n is not divisible by 8, 6k is not a multiple of 8. So, 6k can't have three factors of 2. That means 6k has exactly one factor of 2, making it divisible by 2 but not necessarily by 4.\n\nWait, but n is 6k, and 6k is 2*3k. If k is even, meaning k has a factor of 2, then 6k would be 2*2*3k, which is divisible by 4. But if k is odd, then 6k would only have one factor of 2, making it not divisible by 4.\n\nHowever, since n is not divisible by 8, which is 2^3, that means that n can't have three factors of 2. So, n has either one or two factors of 2. If it had two, then it would be divisible by 4, but not by 8. If it had one, it wouldn't be divisible by 4 either.\n\nWait, but n is divisible by 6, which is 2*3. So, n must have at least one factor of 2 and one factor of 3. But does it necessarily have another factor of 2? Not necessarily. For example, take n=6. 6 is divisible by 6 but not by 8. 6 divided by 4 is 1.5, so it leaves a remainder. Therefore, 6 is not divisible by 4, so Statement 3 is not necessarily true.\n\nWait, but if k is even, like k=2, then n=12. 12 is divisible by 4 because 12/4=3. But n=12 is also divisible by 8? No, 12 divided by 8 is 1.5, which is not an integer. So, 12 is divisible by 4 but not by 8. Therefore, n could be divisible by 4 or not, depending on k.\n\nSo, since n could be either divisible by 4 or not, Statement 3 is not necessarily true.\n\n**Statement 4: n leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 4.**\n\nLet me think about this. If n is divisible by 6, and not by 8, what can we say about n modulo 4?\n\nWell, n=6k. Let's consider 6k modulo 4.\n\n6 mod 4 is 2, so 6k mod 4 is (2k) mod 4.\n\nSo, if k is even, say k=2m, then 6k=12m, which is 0 mod 4. So, n would be divisible by 4 in that case.\n\nBut if k is odd, say k=2m+1, then 6k=6*(2m+1)=12m+6, which is 6 mod 4, which is 2 mod 4.\n\nTherefore, when k is even, n is divisible by 4, and when k is odd, n leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 4.\n\nBut wait, since n is not divisible by 8, let's see. If n were divisible by 8, it would have to be divisible by 4 as well. But since it's not divisible by 8, it might or might not be divisible by 4.\n\nSo, n could be either 0 mod 4 or 2 mod 4, depending on k. Therefore, Statement 4 says n leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 4, which isn't necessarily always true because sometimes n could be divisible by 4.\n\nFor example, take n=12: 12 divided by 4 is 3, so no remainder. But n=6: 6 divided by 4 is 1 with a remainder of 2. So, sometimes it's 2, sometimes 0. Therefore, Statement 4 is not necessarily true.\n\n**Statement 5: n leaves a remainder of 4 when divided by 8.**\n\nLet's check this. If n is not divisible by 8, what can we say about n mod 8?\n\nn=6k. Let's see what 6k mod 8 can be.\n\n6k mod 8: Let's consider k values.\n\nIf k=1: 6*1=6 mod8=6\nk=2: 12 mod8=4\nk=3: 18 mod8=2\nk=4:24 mod8=0\nk=5:30 mod8=6\nk=6:36 mod8=4\nk=7:42 mod8=2\nk=8:48 mod8=0\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, when k is even, 6k mod8 cycles through 0,4,0,4, etc. When k is odd, it cycles through 6,2,6,2, etc.\n\nBut since n is not divisible by 8, n mod8 cannot be 0. So, possible remainders are 2,4,6.\n\nTherefore, n can leave a remainder of 2,4, or6 when divided by8, depending on the value of k.\n\nSo, Statement 5 says n leaves a remainder of4 when divided by8. But from the above, n could leave a remainder of 2,4, or6. So, it's not necessarily always 4. Therefore, Statement5 is not necessarily true.\n\nWait, but let's think again. Since n is not divisible by8, it can't be 0 mod8. So, possible remainders are 1-7. But from 6k, n can be 6,4,2,0,6,4,2,0,... So, in the case of n not being divisible by8, n mod8 can be 2,4, or6.\n\nTherefore, n could leave a remainder of4, but it's not guaranteed. For example, n=6: 6 mod8=6, so remainder 6. n=12: 12 mod8=4. n=18:18 mod8=2. So, it varies.\n\nTherefore, Statement5 is not necessarily true.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\n- Statement1: Always true\n- Statement2: Always true\n- Statement3: Not necessarily true\n- Statement4: Not necessarily true\n- Statement5: Not necessarily true\n\nTherefore, the correct statements are 1 and 2.\n</think>\n\nDONE."

If we know that n is divisible by 6 but not divisible by 8, which of the following statements must be true?\n1. n is divisible by 3\n2. n is divisible by 2\n3. n is divisible by 4\n4. n leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 4\n5. n leaves a remainder of 4 when divided by 8 \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I've got this problem here about a positive integer n. It says that n is divisible by 6 but not divisible by 8. And I need to figure out which of the given statements must be true. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what it means for a number to be divisible by 6. If a number is divisible by 6, it means that it's divisible by both 2 and 3 because 6 is 2 multiplied by 3, and 2 and 3 are prime numbers. So, if n is divisible by 6, then it must be even (divisible by 2) and the sum of its digits must be divisible by 3. That gives me some starting points.\n\nNext, the problem says that n is not divisible by 8. So, even though it's divisible by 2, it's not divisible by 8. That means when n is divided by 8, there will be some remainder. I need to figure out what that remainder could be.\n\nLet me think about the relationship between divisibility by 2 and 8. If a number is divisible by 8, it must also be divisible by 2 because 8 is a multiple of 2. But the converse isn't true; being divisible by 2 doesn't necessarily mean it's divisible by 8. So, n being not divisible by 8 doesn't take away anything from it being divisible by 2.\n\nNow, let's look at the options one by one.\n\n1. **n is divisible by 3.**  \nSince n is divisible by 6, which is 2 times 3, it must be divisible by both 2 and 3. So, yes, this statement must be true.\n\n2. **n is divisible by 2.**  \nAgain, since n is divisible by 6, it's definitely divisible by 2. So, this is also true.\n\n3. **n is divisible by 4.**  \nHmm, this one is trickier. If n is divisible by 2, it might or might not be divisible by 4. For example, take n=6. 6 divided by 4 is 1 with a remainder of 2, so it's not divisible by 4. But n=12 is divisible by both 6 and 4. So, it depends on the number. Therefore, we can't say for sure that n is divisible by 4. So, this statement isn't necessarily true.\n\n4. **n leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 4.**  \nLet's test this. If n is divisible by 6, let's pick n=6. 6 divided by 4 is 1 with a remainder of 2. Okay, that works. What about n=12? 12 divided by 4 is 3 with no remainder, so the remainder is 0. So, sometimes it leaves a remainder of 2, sometimes not. Therefore, this isn't necessarily true for all such n.\n\n5. **n leaves a remainder of 4 when divided by 8.**  \nLet's test this as well. Take n=6: 6 divided by 8 is 0 with a remainder of 6, not 4. So, that doesn't fit. How about n=10? 10 divided by 8 is 1 with a remainder of 2. Nope. What about n=14? 14 divided by 8 is 1 with a remainder of 6. Still not 4. Let's try n=22: 22 divided by 8 is 2 with a remainder of 6. Hmm, not 4. It seems like n doesn't necessarily leave a remainder of 4 when divided by 8. So, this isn't a given.\n\nSo, out of all the options, only statements 1 and 2 must be true because n is divisible by 6, which inherently means it's divisible by both 2 and 3. The other statements depend on specific cases which might not always hold true.\n\nI think I've covered all the possibilities. Let me double-check. For statement 3, I considered n=6 and n=12, which showed that it's not always divisible by 4. For statement 4, n=6 gives a remainder of 2, but n=12 gives a remainder of 0, so it's not consistent. For statement 5, none of the examples I tried gave a remainder of 4 when divided by 8, so that's not a must.\n\nYeah, I'm pretty confident now that only statements 1 and 2 are always true.\n</think>\n\n1. n is divisible by 3  \n2. n is divisible by 2  \nDONE."

We know that n is divisible by 6 but not divisible by 8. Then, which of the statements 1 through 5 must be true?\n\nOkay, let's break this down step by step. First, I need to recall what it means for a number to be divisible by certain numbers. Divisible by 6 means that when you divide n by 6, there's no remainder. Similarly, not divisible by 8 means that when you divide n by 8, there is a remainder.\n\nSo, starting with statement 1: n is divisible by 3. Hmm, well, since n is divisible by 6, and 6 is 2 multiplied by 3, that means n must also be divisible by both 2 and 3. So, yes, statement 1 must be true because 6 is a multiple of 3.\n\nMoving on to statement 2: n is divisible by 2. Again, since 6 is 2 times 3, n must be divisible by 2. So statement 2 also must be true.\n\nNow, statement 3: n is divisible by 4. Hmm, this one is trickier. We know that n is divisible by 2, but does that mean it's divisible by 4? Well, not necessarily. For example, if n is 6, it's divisible by 2 but not by 4. So, just because a number is even doesn't mean it's divisible by 4. So, statement 3 doesn't have to be true.\n\nNext, statement 4: n leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 4. Let's think about this. If n is divisible by 2, it's either even or odd, but since it's divisible by 6, it's definitely even. So, when you divide an even number by 4, it could either leave a remainder of 0 or 2. But we know that n is not divisible by 8, which is 2 cubed. So, if n were divisible by 8, it would be divisible by 4 as well. But since it's not, it must not be a multiple of 8. So, n could be like 6, 10, 14, etc. Let's check 6 divided by 4: 6 divided by 4 is 1 with a remainder of 2. 10 divided by 4 is 2 with a remainder of 2. 14 divided by 4 is 3 with a remainder of 2. So, in these cases, it leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 4. So, statement 4 seems to hold true.\n\nLastly, statement 5: n leaves a remainder of 4 when divided by 8. Let's test this with the numbers I mentioned earlier. 6 divided by 8 is 0 with a remainder of 6. 10 divided by 8 is 1 with a remainder of 2. 14 divided by 8 is 1 with a remainder of 6. So, sometimes it leaves a remainder of 6 or 2, but never 4. So, statement 5 isn't necessarily true.\n\nSo, summarizing my thoughts: Statements 1, 2, and 4 must be true, while 3 and 5 are not necessarily true.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check statement 3. If n is divisible by 6, it's 2*3. But 4 is 2 squared. So, n could have only one factor of 2, making it divisible by 2 but not by 4. So, yes, statement 3 isn't necessarily true.\n\nAnd for statement 4, since n isn't divisible by 8, it can't be divisible by 4 either. Because if it were divisible by 4, it would have at least two factors of 2, which would make it divisible by 8 if there are more. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again.\n\nIf n is divisible by 4, that means it has at least two factors of 2. But if it's not divisible by 8, it can't have three factors of 2. So, n could have exactly two factors of 2, making it divisible by 4 but not by 8. But in our case, since n is only divisible by 6, which is 2*3, it has exactly one factor of 2. So, it's not divisible by 4 either. Therefore, statement 4 must be true because n can't have two factors of 2; otherwise, it would be divisible by 4, and potentially 8 if it had more.\n\nWait, now I'm confused. Let's clarify. If n is divisible by 6, it has at least one 2 and one 3 in its prime factors. If it's not divisible by 8, which is 2^3, it can have at most two factors of 2. But wait, 6 is 2*3, so n has exactly one 2. Therefore, n cannot be divisible by 4 because that would require at least two 2s. So, n cannot be divisible by 4, and when you divide n by 4, it leaves a remainder of 2 because it's only got one 2 factor.\n\nSo, statement 4 is definitely true because n is not divisible by 4, so when divided by 4, it leaves a remainder of 2.\n\nOkay, so to recap:\n\n1. n is divisible by 3 \u2013 must be true.\n2. n is divisible by 2 \u2013 must be true.\n3. n is divisible by 4 \u2013 not necessarily true.\n4. n leaves remainder 2 when divided by 4 \u2013 must be true.\n5. n leaves remainder 4 when divided by 8 \u2013 not necessarily true.\n\nTherefore, statements 1, 2, and 4 must be true.\n</think>\n\n1. n is divisible by 3  \n2. n is divisible by 2  \n4. n leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 4  \n\nDONE."

It says that n is divisible by 6 but not divisible by 8. I need to figure out which of the given statements must be true. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what it means for a number to be divisible by 6. If a number is divisible by 6, that means it's divisible by both 2 and 3 because 6 is the product of these two primes. So, n must be even (divisible by 2) and the sum of its digits must be a multiple of 3 (divisible by 3).\n\nNow, the problem also states that n is not divisible by 8. That's interesting because 8 is a power of 2, specifically \\(2^3\\). So, even though n is divisible by 2, it's not divisible by 8. That tells me something about the number of times 2 divides into n. Since n is divisible by 2 but not by 8, the exponent of 2 in its prime factorization must be exactly 1 or 2. Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nIf a number is divisible by 8, it must have at least three factors of 2. Since n isn't divisible by 8, it can have at most two factors of 2. So, the highest power of 2 that divides n is either \\(2^1\\) or \\(2^2\\). That means n is either even but not divisible by 4, or it's divisible by 4 but not by 8. Hmm, but wait, if n is divisible by 6, which is 2\u00d73, and not by 8, then n must be divisible by 2 but not by 4 or 8? No, that's not necessarily the case. Let me clarify.\n\nActually, since n is divisible by 6, it's at least divisible by 2 and 3. If it's also divisible by 4, that would mean it's divisible by 8 only if it's divisible by 16, right? No, wait, that's not correct. Divisible by 4 means it's divisible by \\(2^2\\), and divisible by 8 means it's divisible by \\(2^3\\). So, if n is divisible by 6 and also divisible by 4, it would still not necessarily be divisible by 8 unless it has at least three factors of 2. But since n is not divisible by 8, it can't have three factors of 2. So, n can have either one or two factors of 2.\n\nBut wait, let's think about it differently. If n is divisible by 6, it must be even, so it's divisible by 2. Now, if n is divisible by 4, it would be divisible by 8 only if it's also divisible by 2 again. But n isn't divisible by 8, so it can't have three 2s. So, n could be divisible by 2 but not by 4, or divisible by 4 but not by 8.\n\nWait, but if n is divisible by 6, which is 2\u00d73, and also divisible by 4, which is \\(2^2\\), then n would be divisible by \\(2^2 \u00d7 3\\), which is 12. But 12 is not divisible by 8. So, n could be 12, 24, 36, etc., but not 24, 40, etc., which are divisible by 8. Hmm, I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me approach this systematically.\n\n1. n is divisible by 6 \u21d2 n = 6k for some integer k.\n2. n is not divisible by 8 \u21d2 6k is not divisible by 8.\n\nSo, 6k mod 8 \u2260 0.\n\nLet's see what this implies about k.\n\nWe can write 6k mod 8 \u2260 0.\n\nLet's find k such that 6k mod 8 \u2260 0.\n\nSince 6 and 8 are both even, let's see:\n\n6k mod 8 can be 0, 2, 4, or 6 because 6 is even.\n\nWait, 6k mod 8:\n\nLet's compute 6k mod 8 for k=1: 6\u00d71=6 mod8=6\nk=2: 12 mod8=4\nk=3:18 mod8=2\nk=4:24 mod8=0\nk=5:30 mod8=6\nk=6:36 mod8=4\nk=7:42 mod8=2\nk=8:48 mod8=0\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, 6k mod8 cycles through 6,4,2,0,6,4,2,0,...\n\nSince n is not divisible by 8, 6k mod8 \u22600, so k cannot be a multiple of 4.\n\nTherefore, k is an integer not divisible by 4.\n\nSo, k can be 1,2,3,5,6,7,9,...\n\nNow, let's see what this tells us about n.\n\nn=6k, and k is not divisible by 4.\n\nSo, n=6k where k is not divisible by 4.\n\nNow, let's analyze the statements.\n\n1. n is divisible by 3: Since n=6k, and 6 is divisible by 3, yes, n must be divisible by 3. So statement 1 is true.\n\n2. n is divisible by 2: Since n=6k, and 6 is even, yes, n is divisible by 2. So statement 2 is true.\n\n3. n is divisible by 4: For n to be divisible by 4, it must be divisible by \\(2^2\\). Now, n=6k. Since 6=2\u00d73, and k is not divisible by 4, the total number of 2s in n's prime factors is only 1 (from 6) multiplied by the number of 2s in k.\n\nBut wait, k is not divisible by 4, so k has at most one 2 in its factors. So, n=6k would have 1 (from 6) plus at most 1 (from k) = 2 factors of 2. So, n is divisible by 4.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that if k is not divisible by 4, n might not be divisible by 4. Let me check with an example.\n\nTake k=1: n=6\u00d71=6. 6 is not divisible by 4. So, statement 3 is not always true.\n\nBut wait, according to my earlier reasoning, n=6k, and if k is not divisible by 4, n would have exactly two factors of 2 only if k has one factor of 2. But if k has zero factors of 2, then n=6k would have one factor of 2, making it not divisible by 4.\n\nWait, so n=6k, and k can have either 0 or 1 factors of 2, because k is not divisible by 4 (since k mod4\u22600). So, if k is even but not divisible by 4 (i.e., k is 2 mod4), then n=6k would have 2\u00d72=4 as a factor, making it divisible by 4. But if k is odd, then n=6k would have only one factor of 2, making it not divisible by 4.\n\nSo, statement 3 is not necessarily true because n could be 6 (not divisible by 4) or 12 (divisible by 4). So, statement 3 is sometimes true, but not always. Therefore, it's not a must.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought n=6k where k is not divisible by 4, so n could be 6, 10, 14, 18, etc. Let's see:\n\nn=6: 6 mod4=2 \u21d2 not divisible by 4\nn=10:10 mod4=2 \u21d2 not divisible by 4\nn=14:14 mod4=2 \u21d2 not divisible by 4\nn=18:18 mod4=2 \u21d2 not divisible by 4\nn=22:22 mod4=2 \u21d2 not divisible by 4\nn=26:26 mod4=2 \u21d2 not divisible by 4\nn=30:30 mod4=2 \u21d2 not divisible by 4\nn=34:34 mod4=2 \u21d2 not divisible by 4\nn=38:38 mod4=2 \u21d2 not divisible by 4\nn=42:42 mod4=2 \u21d2 not divisible by 4\nn=46:46 mod4=2 \u21d2 not divisible by 4\nn=50:50 mod4=2 \u21d2 not divisible by 4\n\nWait, all these numbers are 6\u00d7k where k is 1,2,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,...\n\nBut wait, when k=2, n=12. 12 is divisible by 4. But k=2 is not divisible by 4? Wait, no, k=2 is divisible by 2 but not by 4. So, k=2 is allowed because k is not divisible by 4. So, n=12 is allowed, and 12 is divisible by 4.\n\nBut earlier, I thought that when k is even (like k=2,6,10,...), n would be divisible by 4, but when k is odd, n would not be. So, statement 3 is not necessarily true because n could be 6 (not divisible by 4) or 12 (divisible by 4). Therefore, statement 3 is not always true.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"must be true,\" meaning it's a necessary condition. So, if there exists an n that satisfies the conditions but doesn't satisfy statement 3, then statement 3 is not necessarily true.\n\nSo, statement 3 is not necessarily true.\n\n4. n leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 4.\n\nLet's check n=6: 6 mod4=2 \u21d2 yes\nn=12:12 mod4=0 \u21d2 no\nn=10:10 mod4=2 \u21d2 yes\nn=18:18 mod4=2 \u21d2 yes\nn=24:24 mod4=0 \u21d2 no, but wait, n=24 is divisible by 8, which is not allowed. So, n cannot be 24 because n is not divisible by 8.\n\nWait, n=6,10,14,18,22,26, etc., which are n=6k where k=1,2,3,5,7,9,...\n\nSo, n=6k, and k is not divisible by 4.\n\nNow, let's see what n mod4 is.\n\nn=6k mod4.\n\nSince 6 mod4=2, so 6k mod4= (2k) mod4.\n\nSo, 2k mod4 can be:\n\nIf k is even (k=2m), then 2k=4m \u21d2 4m mod4=0\nIf k is odd (k=2m+1), then 2k=4m+2 \u21d2 2 mod4=2\n\nBut wait, k is not divisible by 4, which means k can be either even or odd.\n\nWait, no. k is not divisible by 4, so k can be 1,2,3,5,6,7,9,...\n\nSo, k can be even (like 2,6,10,...) or odd (1,3,5,7,...).\n\nBut since k is not divisible by 4, it can still be even or odd.\n\nSo, when k is even (but not divisible by 4), let's say k=2m where m is not divisible by 2 (i.e., m is odd), then 2k=4m \u21d2 0 mod4.\n\nBut wait, if k is even but not divisible by 4, then k=2m where m is odd. So, 2k=4m \u21d2 0 mod4.\n\nBut wait, n=6k, so n=6*(2m)=12m \u21d2 12m mod4=0 because 12 is divisible by 4.\n\nWait, no, 12m mod4=0 because 12 is 0 mod4.\n\nWait, that contradicts my earlier examples.\n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\nIf k is even but not divisible by 4, i.e., k=2m where m is odd, then n=6k=6*(2m)=12m.\n\nNow, 12m is divisible by 4 because 12 is divisible by 4. So, 12m mod4=0.\n\nBut earlier, I saw that n=12 is divisible by 4, which is correct.\n\nBut when k is odd, say k=2m+1, then n=6k=6*(2m+1)=12m+6.\n\nNow, 12m is divisible by 4, and 6 mod4=2. So, 12m+6 mod4=0+2=2.\n\nTherefore, when k is odd, n mod4=2, and when k is even (but not divisible by 4), n mod4=0.\n\nSo, n can be either 0 or 2 mod4.\n\nBut the problem is asking which statement must be true. Statement 4 says that n leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 4. But n can be 0 mod4 (like 12) or 2 mod4 (like 6,10,18, etc.). So, it's not necessarily always 2 mod4. Therefore, statement 4 is not necessarily true.\n\nWait, but in the cases where k is even (but not divisible by 4), n is divisible by 4, which is 0 mod4, so n can be either 0 or 2 mod4. Therefore, statement 4 is not necessarily true.\n\n5. n leaves a remainder of 4 when divided by 8.\n\nLet's check this.\n\nn=6k, and n mod8\u22600.\n\nWe need to see what n mod8 is.\n\nLet me compute 6k mod8 for various k:\n\nk=1:6\u00d71=6 mod8=6\nk=2:12 mod8=4\nk=3:18 mod8=2\nk=4:24 mod8=0 (but k=4 is not allowed because n would be divisible by 8)\nk=5:30 mod8=6\nk=6:36 mod8=4\nk=7:42 mod8=2\nk=8:48 mod8=0 (k=8 is not allowed)\nk=9:54 mod8=6\nk=10:60 mod8=4\nk=11:66 mod8=2\nk=12:72 mod8=0 (k=12 is not allowed)\n...\n\nSo, n mod8 cycles through 6,4,2,0,6,4,2,0,...\n\nBut since n is not divisible by 8, n mod8 can be 6,4, or 2.\n\nSo, n can leave a remainder of 2,4, or6 when divided by8.\n\nTherefore, statement 5 says that n leaves a remainder of4 when divided by8. But n can also leave 2 or6, so it's not necessarily true.\n\nWait, but let's see. From the earlier analysis, when k is odd, n=6k=6*(2m+1)=12m+6. So, 12m mod8= (12 mod8)*m=4m, and 6 mod8=6. So, 4m+6 mod8.\n\nIf m is odd, say m=1:4\u00d71+6=10 mod8=2\nm=3:4\u00d73+6=18 mod8=2\nm=5:4\u00d75+6=26 mod8=2\nSo, when k is odd, n mod8=2.\n\nWhen k is even (but not divisible by4), say k=2m where m is odd, then n=6k=12m.\n\n12m mod8= (12 mod8)*m=4m.\n\nIf m is odd, 4m mod8=4\u00d71=4\nIf m is even, 4m mod8=0, but m is odd because k=2m is not divisible by4.\n\nWait, k=2m where m is odd, so m is 1,3,5,...\n\nSo, 4m=4\u00d71=4, 4\u00d73=12\u22614 mod8, 4\u00d75=20\u22614 mod8, etc.\n\nSo, when k is even (but not divisible by4), n mod8=4.\n\nTherefore, depending on whether k is odd or even (but not divisible by4), n mod8 is either 2 or4.\n\nSo, n can be 2 or4 mod8, but never 0 or6 (except when k is odd, n mod8=6? Wait, earlier when k=1, n=6 mod8=6. But k=1 is odd, so m=0.5? Wait, no, k=1 is odd, so n=6\u00d71=6 mod8=6.\n\nWait, in my earlier analysis, I considered k=1 as odd, leading to n=6\u00d71=6 mod8=6, but in the more detailed analysis when k is odd, n=12m+6, which when m=0 (k=1), n=6 mod8=6.\n\nBut earlier, I thought that when k is odd, n mod8=2, but that's incorrect because when m=0, it's 6 mod8.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-express n when k is odd.\n\nLet me write k=2m+1, where m is integer \u22650.\n\nThen, n=6k=6*(2m+1)=12m+6.\n\nNow, 12m mod8= (12 mod8)*m=4m.\n\nSo, 12m+6 mod8=4m+6.\n\nNow, 4m can be 0,4,8,... but mod8, it's either 0 or4.\n\nIf m is even, say m=2p, then 4m=8p\u22610 mod8. So, 0+6=6 mod8.\n\nIf m is odd, say m=2p+1, then 4m=4*(2p+1)=8p+4\u22614 mod8. So, 4+6=10\u22612 mod8.\n\nTherefore, when k is odd:\n\n- If m is even (i.e., m=2p), then n mod8=6.\n- If m is odd (i.e., m=2p+1), then n mod8=2.\n\nBut wait, m"

If we know that n is divisible by 6 but not divisible by 8, which of the following statements must be true?\n1. n is divisible by 3\n2. n is divisible by 2\n3. n is divisible by 4\n4. n leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 4\n5. n leaves a remainder of 4 when divided by 8 \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this problem here about a positive integer n. The problem says that n is divisible by 6 but not divisible by 8. And I need to figure out which of the given statements must be true. Let me take this step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that if a number is divisible by 6, it means that it's divisible by both 2 and 3 because 6 is 2 multiplied by 3. So, n must be even (divisible by 2) and the sum of its digits must be divisible by 3. That's a good starting point.\n\nNow, the problem also says that n is not divisible by 8. Divisibility by 8 depends on the last three digits of the number. For example, a number is divisible by 8 if the number formed by its last three digits is divisible by 8. Since n is not divisible by 8, that tells me something about its last three digits. But I'm not sure exactly what yet, so I'll keep that in mind.\n\nLet me look at the options one by one.\n\n1. **n is divisible by 3.**\n   \n   Well, since n is divisible by 6, and 6 is 2 times 3, n must be divisible by both 2 and 3. So, yes, this statement must be true. I'll tentatively mark this as correct.\n\n2. **n is divisible by 2.**\n   \n   Similar to the first point, because n is divisible by 6, it's also divisible by 2. So, this must be true as well.\n\n3. **n is divisible by 4.**\n   \n   Hmm, this is a bit trickier. Divisibility by 4 depends on the last two digits of the number. For example, if the last two digits form a number that's divisible by 4, then the entire number is divisible by 4. Now, since n is divisible by 2, it's even, which means the last digit is even (0, 2, 4, 6, 8). But to be divisible by 4, the last two digits must form a number like 00, 04, 08, 12, 16, etc.\n\n   Wait, but n is not divisible by 8. Does that affect its divisibility by 4? Let me think. If a number is divisible by 8, it's also divisible by 4 because 8 is a multiple of 4. So, if n is not divisible by 8, it doesn't necessarily mean it's not divisible by 4. For example, 12 is divisible by 4 but not by 8. So, n could be divisible by 4. But is it a must?\n\n   Let me test with some numbers. Take n=12: divisible by 6, not by 8. 12 is divisible by 4. Take n=18: divisible by 6, not by 8. 18 divided by 4 is 4.5, so not divisible by 4. So here, 18 is divisible by 6, not by 8, and not divisible by 4. So, it's not a must that n is divisible by 4. Therefore, statement 3 is not necessarily true.\n\n4. **n leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 4.**\n   \n   Let's analyze this. If n is divisible by 2, the last digit is even. When you divide by 4, the possible remainders are 0, 1, 2, or 3. But since n is divisible by 2, the remainder when divided by 4 can't be 1 or 3 because those would make the last digit odd. So, the possible remainders are 0 or 2.\n\n   Now, since n is not divisible by 8, which is a multiple of 4, does that mean it can't be divisible by 4? No, as I saw earlier with n=12. So, n could be divisible by 4 (remainder 0) or not (remainder 2). Therefore, n could leave a remainder of 2 when divided by 4, but it's not a must. For example, n=12 leaves a remainder of 0, while n=18 leaves a remainder of 2. So, statement 4 is not necessarily true.\n\n5. **n leaves a remainder of 4 when divided by 8.**\n   \n   Let me think about this. If n is not divisible by 8, what are the possible remainders when divided by 8? They can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.\n\n   But since n is divisible by 6, let's see if it can leave a remainder of 4 when divided by 8. For example, take n=10: 10 is divisible by 2 and 5, but not by 3 or 6. So, that doesn't fit. Wait, n must be divisible by 6, so let's pick numbers divisible by 6 but not by 8.\n\n   Let's try n=6: 6 divided by 8 is 0 with remainder 6. So, not 4.\n   \n   n=12: 12 divided by 8 is 1 with remainder 4. So, here, the remainder is 4.\n   \n   n=18: 18 divided by 8 is 2 with remainder 2.\n   \n   n=24: 24 is divisible by 8, so that's out.\n   \n   n=30: 30 divided by 8 is 3 with remainder 6.\n   \n   n=36: 36 divided by 8 is 4 with remainder 4.\n   \n   So, sometimes n leaves a remainder of 4 when divided by 8, but other times it doesn't. For example, n=12 and n=36 leave a remainder of 4, while n=18 leaves a remainder of 2. So, it's not a must that n leaves a remainder of 4 when divided by 8. Therefore, statement 5 is not necessarily true.\n\nWait, but I need to double-check. Is there a pattern where n must always leave a certain remainder when divided by 8? Let me think about the divisibility rules.\n\nSince n is divisible by 6, it's even and the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. Now, when considering modulo 8, numbers divisible by 6 can have different remainders. For example:\n\n- 6 mod 8 = 6\n- 12 mod 8 = 4\n- 18 mod 8 = 2\n- 24 mod 8 = 0 (but 24 is divisible by 8, so we exclude it)\n- 30 mod 8 = 6\n- 36 mod 8 = 4\n- 42 mod 8 = 2\n- 48 mod 8 = 0 (again, divisible by 8)\n\nSo, it alternates between remainders 6, 4, 2, and 0. But since n is not divisible by 8, the remainder when divided by 8 can't be 0. So, possible remainders are 2, 4, or 6.\n\nBut in the examples above, n=12 and 36 have remainder 4, n=18 and 42 have remainder 2, and n=6 and 30 have remainder 6. So, the remainder can be 2, 4, or 6. Therefore, n doesn't have to leave a specific remainder like 4; it can vary. So, statement 5 isn't necessarily true.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Since n is divisible by 6, can it ever leave a remainder of 6 when divided by 8? Let's see: n=6, which is 6 mod 8. 6 is divisible by 6 but not by 8. So yes, remainder 6 is possible. Similarly, n=30: 30 mod 8 is 6. So, the remainder can be 2, 4, or 6. Therefore, it's not fixed. So, statement 5 is not necessarily true.\n\nNow, going back to the options, statements 1 and 2 must be true because n is divisible by 6, hence divisible by 2 and 3. Statements 3, 4, and 5 are not necessarily true because n could or could not be divisible by 4 or leave specific remainders when divided by 8.\n\nWait, but I should double-check statement 3 again. Is n necessarily divisible by 4? Let's take n=6: 6 divided by 4 is 1 with remainder 2. So, not divisible by 4. But n=12: 12 is divisible by 4. So, n could be or not be divisible by 4. Therefore, statement 3 is not necessarily true.\n\nSimilarly, statement 4: n could leave a remainder of 2 when divided by 4, as in n=18, but not always, as in n=12. So, it's not a must.\n\nSo, the only statements that must be true are 1 and 2.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The problem says \"which of the following statements must be true.\" So, multiple could be true, but only 1 and 2 are definite.\n\nLet me check with another example: n=24. Wait, n=24 is divisible by 8, so it's excluded because the problem says n is not divisible by 8. So, n=24 is out.\n\nAnother example: n=42. 42 is divisible by 6, not by 8. 42 divided by 4 is 10 with remainder 2. So, remainder 2. So, statement 4 is true here, but statement 3 is false because 42 divided by 4 is 10.5, so not divisible by 4.\n\nAnother example: n=6. 6 divided by 4 is 1 with remainder 2. So, statement 4 is true here, but statement 3 is false.\n\nAnother example: n=12. 12 is divisible by 4, so statement 3 is true, and statement 4 is false because 12 divided by 4 is 3 with remainder 0.\n\nSo, in some cases, statement 3 is true, in others, it's false. Similarly, statement 4 can be true or false depending on n.\n\nTherefore, the only statements that must be true are 1 and 2.\n\nBut wait, let me check statement 5 again. Can n ever leave a remainder of 4 when divided by 8? Yes, like n=12 and n=36. But can it also leave other remainders? Yes. So, it's not a must.\n\nSo, to sum up, statements 1 and 2 must be true, while statements 3, 4, and 5 are not necessarily true.\n\nBut wait, the options are numbered from 1 to 5, and the problem asks \"which of the following statements must be true.\" So, the answer is statements 1 and 2.\n\nBut let me check the problem again: it says \"which of the following statements must be true.\" So, it's possible that more than one is correct, but I need to see.\n\nYes, 1 and 2 must be true.\n\nBut wait, the problem is presented in a way that it's likely only one is correct, but in reality, both 1 and 2 are correct. However, looking back, the problem says \"which of the following statements must be true,\" implying that multiple could be correct, so I need to mark all that apply.\n\nBut in the initial problem, the user wrote \"which of the following statements must be true?\" with options 1 to 5. So, I need to indicate which ones are correct.\n\nBut in the initial problem, the user didn't specify if multiple options can be correct. So, perhaps the answer is that statements 1 and 2 must be true.\n\nBut let me think again. Since n is divisible by 6, it's divisible by both 2 and 3. So, statements 1 and 2 are definitely true. Statements 3, 4, and 5 are not necessarily true.\n\nTherefore, the correct statements are 1 and 2.\n\nBut wait, in the initial problem, the user wrote \"which of the following statements must be true?\" So, it's possible that more than one is correct. So, the answer is both 1 and 2.\n\nBut I need to make sure. Let me check with n=6: divisible by 6, not by 8. 6 is divisible by 2 and 3, so statements 1 and 2 are true. 6 divided by 4 is 1 with remainder 2, so statement 4 is true here, but statement 3 is false.\n\nSimilarly, n=12: divisible by 6, not by 8. 12 is divisible by 3 and 2, so statements 1 and 2 are true. 12 is divisible by 4, so statement 3 is true. 12 divided by 4 leaves remainder 0, so statement 4 is false.\n\nn=18: divisible by 6, not by 8. 18 is divisible by 2 and 3, so statements 1 and 2 are true. 18 divided by 4 is 4 with remainder 2, so statement 4 is true, but statement 3 is false.\n\nn=30: divisible by 6, not by 8. 30 is divisible by 2 and 3, so statements 1 and 2 are true. 30 divided by 4 is 7 with remainder 2, so statement 4 is true, statement 3 is false.\n\nn=36: divisible by 6, not by 8. 36 is divisible by 2 and 3, so statements 1 and 2 are true. 36 divided by 4 is 9 with remainder 0, so statement 3 is true, statement 4 is false.\n\nn=42: divisible by 6, not by 8. 42 is divisible by 2 and 3, so statements 1 and 2 are true. 42 divided by 4 is 10 with remainder 2, so statement 4 is true, statement 3 is false.\n\nn=48: divisible by 8, so it's excluded.\n\nn=54: divisible by 6, not by 8. 54 is divisible by 2 and 3, so statements 1 and 2 are true. 54 divided by 4 is 13 with remainder 2, so statement 4 is true, statement 3 is false.\n\nFrom these examples, statements 1 and 2 are always true. Statements 3, 4, and 5 can be true or false depending on the specific n.\n\nTherefore, the correct statements are 1 and 2.\n\nBut wait, the problem is asking which statements must be true, so the answer is that statements 1 and 2 must be true.\n\nBut let me check the original question again to make sure I'm not missing anything. The question is: \"If we know that n is divisible by 6 but not divisible by 8, which of the following statements must be true?\"\n\nSo, the answer is statements 1 and 2 must be true.\n\nBut in the initial problem, the user wrote \"which of the following statements must be true?\" with options 1 to 5. So, the correct options are 1 and 2.\n\nBut wait, let me check if statement 5 can ever be true. For example, n=12: 12 mod 8 is 4, so remainder 4. Similarly, n=36: 36 mod 8 is 4. So, sometimes it's true, but not always. So, it's not a must.\n\nSimilarly, statement 4: sometimes true (like n=18, 42, 54), sometimes false (n=12, 36).\n\nSo, only statements 1 and 2 must be true.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that statements 1 and 2 must be true.\n</think>\n\n1. n is divisible by 3  \n2. n is divisible by 2  \n\nDONE."

The problem says that n is divisible by 6 but not divisible by 8. I need to figure out which of the given statements must be true. Let's go through each statement one by one and see if they have to be true based on the given information.\n\nFirst, let me recall what it means for a number to be divisible by 6. If a number is divisible by 6, it must be divisible by both 2 and 3 because 6 is the product of these two primes. So, n being divisible by 6 means that n is even (divisible by 2) and the sum of its digits must be a multiple of 3 (divisible by 3). That's a good starting point.\n\nNow, the problem also mentions that n is not divisible by 8. That means when we divide n by 8, it doesn't come out evenly. So, n leaves some remainder when divided by 8. Let's think about what that implies.\n\nSince n is divisible by 2, we know it's an even number. So, n could be 2, 4, 6, 8, etc., but since it's not divisible by 8, n can't be 8, 16, 24, and so on. So, n could be 2, 4, 6, 10, 12, etc. Wait, but n is also divisible by 6, so n has to be a multiple of 6. So, let's list some multiples of 6 and see which ones are not divisible by 8.\n\nMultiples of 6: 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, 60, 66, 72, 78, 84, 90, 96, etc.\n\nNow, from this list, which ones are not divisible by 8? Let's check:\n\n- 6 divided by 8 is 0.75, which is not an integer, so 6 is not divisible by 8.\n- 12 divided by 8 is 1.5, also not an integer.\n- 18 divided by 8 is 2.25, not an integer.\n- 24 divided by 8 is 3, which is an integer, so 24 is divisible by 8.\n- 30 divided by 8 is 3.75, not an integer.\n- 36 divided by 8 is 4.5, not an integer.\n- 42 divided by 8 is 5.25, not an integer.\n- 48 divided by 8 is 6, so 48 is divisible by 8.\n- 54 divided by 8 is 6.75, not an integer.\n- 60 divided by 8 is 7.5, not an integer.\n- 66 divided by 8 is 8.25, not an integer.\n- 72 divided by 8 is 9, so 72 is divisible by 8.\n- 78 divided by 8 is 9.75, not an integer.\n- 84 divided by 8 is 10.5, not an integer.\n- 90 divided by 8 is 11.25, not an integer.\n- 96 divided by 8 is 12, so 96 is divisible by 8.\n\nSo, the multiples of 6 that are not divisible by 8 are: 6, 12, 18, 30, 36, 42, 54, 60, 66, 78, 84, 90, etc.\n\nNow, let's go through each statement and see if they must be true for all these numbers.\n\n1. **n is divisible by 3**: Since n is a multiple of 6, and 6 is 2 multiplied by 3, n must be divisible by both 2 and 3. So, yes, this statement must be true.\n\n2. **n is divisible by 2**: Similarly, since n is a multiple of 6, it's also even, meaning it's divisible by 2. So, this statement must also be true.\n\n3. **n is divisible by 4**: Hmm, this is trickier. Let's see. For a number to be divisible by 4, it must be divisible by 4. But n is only required to be divisible by 6, not necessarily by 4. Let's check some examples:\n\n   - 6 divided by 4 is 1.5, so 6 is not divisible by 4.\n   - 12 divided by 4 is 3, so 12 is divisible by 4.\n   - 18 divided by 4 is 4.5, so not divisible by 4.\n   - 30 divided by 4 is 7.5, not divisible by 4.\n   - 36 divided by 4 is 9, so yes.\n   - 42 divided by 4 is 10.5, not divisible.\n   - 54 divided by 4 is 13.5, not divisible.\n   - 60 divided by 4 is 15, so yes.\n   - 66 divided by 4 is 16.5, not divisible.\n   - 78 divided by 4 is 19.5, not divisible.\n   - 84 divided by 4 is 21, yes.\n   - 90 divided by 4 is 22.5, not divisible.\n\n   So, it seems that sometimes n is divisible by 4 and sometimes not. Therefore, this statement doesn't have to be true for all such n.\n\n4. **n leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 4**: Let's check this. When a number leaves a remainder of 2 upon division by 4, it means it's of the form 4k + 2, where k is an integer.\n\n   Let's see if all the numbers we listed fit this:\n\n   - 6: 6 divided by 4 is 1 with a remainder of 2. So yes.\n   - 12: 12 divided by 4 is 3 with no remainder. So no.\n   - 18: 18 divided by 4 is 4 with a remainder of 2. Yes.\n   - 30: 30 divided by 4 is 7 with a remainder of 2. Yes.\n   - 36: 36 divided by 4 is 9 with no remainder. No.\n   - 42: 42 divided by 4 is 10 with a remainder of 2. Yes.\n   - 54: 54 divided by 4 is 13 with a remainder of 2. Yes.\n   - 60: 60 divided by 4 is 15 with no remainder. No.\n   - 66: 66 divided by 4 is 16 with a remainder of 2. Yes.\n   - 78: 78 divided by 4 is 19 with a remainder of 2. Yes.\n   - 84: 84 divided by 4 is 21 with no remainder. No.\n   - 90: 90 divided by 4 is 22 with a remainder of 2. Yes.\n\n   So, it's not consistent. Some of these numbers leave a remainder of 2 when divided by 4, and others don't. Therefore, this statement doesn't have to be true for all n.\n\n5. **n leaves a remainder of 4 when divided by 8**: Let's think about this. If n leaves a remainder of 4 when divided by 8, it's of the form 8k + 4.\n\n   Let's check the numbers we listed:\n\n   - 6: 6 divided by 8 is 0 with remainder 6. No.\n   - 12: 12 divided by 8 is 1 with remainder 4. Yes.\n   - 18: 18 divided by 8 is 2 with remainder 2. No.\n   - 30: 30 divided by 8 is 3 with remainder 6. No.\n   - 36: 36 divided by 8 is 4 with remainder 4. Yes.\n   - 42: 42 divided by 8 is 5 with remainder 2. No.\n   - 54: 54 divided by 8 is 6 with remainder 6. No.\n   - 60: 60 divided by 8 is 7 with remainder 4. Yes.\n   - 66: 66 divided by 8 is 8 with remainder 2. No.\n   - 78: 78 divided by 8 is 9 with remainder 6. No.\n   - 84: 84 divided by 8 is 10 with remainder 4. Yes.\n   - 90: 90 divided by 8 is 11 with remainder 2. No.\n\n   So, some of these numbers leave a remainder of 4 when divided by 8, and others don't. Therefore, this statement doesn't have to be true for all n.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n1. Must be true: 1, 2\n2. Must be true: 1, 2\n3. Not necessarily true: 3\n4. Not necessarily true: 4\n5. Not necessarily true: 5\n\nTherefore, the statements that must be true are 1 and 2.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. The problem says \"which of the following statements must be true,\" implying that more than one could be true. So, the correct answers are statements 1 and 2.\n\nI think that's it. Let me make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nYes, since n is divisible by 6, it's automatically divisible by both 2 and 3, so statements 1 and 2 must be true. The other statements might be true for some n but not all, so they don't have to be true.\n</think>\n\n1. n is divisible by 3  \n2. n is divisible by 2  \n\n**DONE.**"

If we know that n is divisible by 6 but not divisible by 8, which of the following statements must be true?\n1. n is divisible by 3\n2. n is divisible by 2\n3. n is divisible by 4\n4. n leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 4\n5. n leaves a remainder of 4 when divided by 8 \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this problem here about a positive integer n. It says that n is divisible by 6 but not divisible by 8. I need to figure out which of the given statements must be true. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what it means for a number to be divisible by 6. If n is divisible by 6, that means 6 is a factor of n. So, n can be written as 6 times some integer k, right? So, n = 6k. Now, since 6 is 2 multiplied by 3, this tells me that n must be divisible by both 2 and 3. That already gives me some information.\n\nLooking at the options, statement 1 says that n is divisible by 3. Well, since 6 is 2 times 3, any multiple of 6 has to be a multiple of 3 as well. So, statement 1 must be true. That seems straightforward.\n\nMoving on to statement 2: n is divisible by 2. Again, since 6 is 2 times 3, n = 6k means that n is definitely divisible by 2. So, statement 2 is also true. Okay, so far, both 1 and 2 are definitely true.\n\nNow, statement 3: n is divisible by 4. Hmm, this one is trickier. Let's think about it. If n is divisible by 6, it's also divisible by 2, but does that mean it's necessarily divisible by 4? Well, let's test this with an example. Take n = 6. Is 6 divisible by 4? No, because 6 divided by 4 is 1.5, which isn't an integer. So, n = 6 isn't divisible by 4. Therefore, statement 3 isn't necessarily true. So, we can eliminate statement 3.\n\nNext, statement 4: n leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 4. Let me think. If n is divisible by 2, it could be either even or divisible by 4. But since n isn't divisible by 8, maybe it's not a multiple of 4. Wait, let me test this with n = 6 again. If I divide 6 by 4, the remainder is 2. So, in this case, n does leave a remainder of 2 when divided by 4. But what if n is 12? 12 divided by 4 is 3, so the remainder is 0. So, in this case, the remainder isn't 2. Therefore, statement 4 isn't always true either. So, statement 4 can't be the answer.\n\nLastly, statement 5: n leaves a remainder of 4 when divided by 8. Let's test this. Take n = 6 again. 6 divided by 8 is 0 with a remainder of 6, not 4. So, that doesn't work. How about n = 12? 12 divided by 8 is 1 with a remainder of 4. So, here, the remainder is 4. But what if n = 18? 18 divided by 8 is 2 with a remainder of 2. So, that's not 4. So, statement 5 also isn't always true.\n\nPutting it all together, statements 1 and 2 are always true, while statements 3, 4, and 5 are not necessarily true. Therefore, the correct answer must include both statements 1 and 2.\n\nWait, but the question says \"which of the following statements must be true.\" So, are we supposed to pick all that apply? Or just the ones that are true? I think since it's a multiple-choice question, but in this case, it's more like a list of statements, and we have to pick all that must be true. So, both 1 and 2 must be true.\n\nBut let me double-check. Since n is divisible by 6, it's divisible by 2 and 3, so statements 1 and 2 are definitely true. Statements 3, 4, and 5 are not necessarily true because we can have examples where they don't hold. So, yes, the correct statements are 1 and 2.\n</think>\n\n1. n is divisible by 3  \n2. n is divisible by 2  \n\nDONE."

If we know that n is divisible by 6 but not divisible by 8, which of the following statements must be true?\n1. n is divisible by 3\n2. n is divisible by 2\n3. n is divisible by 4\n4. n leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 4\n5. n leaves a remainder of 4 when divided by 8 \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this problem here where I need to figure out which statements must be true if a positive integer n is divisible by 6 but not by 8. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst off, the problem says that n is divisible by 6. Okay, so I know that 6 can be factored into prime numbers as 2 and 3. That means n must have both 2 and 3 as factors. So right away, I can say that n is even because it's divisible by 2, and it must also be divisible by 3. That seems straightforward.\n\nNow, the second part is that n is not divisible by 8. Hmm, 8 is 2 cubed, so for a number to be divisible by 8, it needs to have at least three 2s in its prime factorization. But since n is only divisible by 2 once (from the 6 factorization), that means n can't have three 2s. So what does that tell me? It tells me that n is divisible by 2 but not by 4 or 8. Wait, is that right? Let me think.\n\nIf n is divisible by 2, it's even. But if it's not divisible by 4, that means when you divide n by 2, you get an odd number. For example, 6 divided by 2 is 3, which is odd. So n must be of the form 2 times an odd number. That means n is divisible by 2 but not by 4. Okay, that makes sense.\n\nLet me list out the statements and see which ones must be true.\n\n1. **n is divisible by 3**: Since n is divisible by 6, and 6 is 2 times 3, n must have 3 as a factor. So yes, this must be true.\n\n2. **n is divisible by 2**: As established earlier, since n is divisible by 6, it's also divisible by 2. So this must be true.\n\n3. **n is divisible by 4**: Wait, n is not divisible by 8, but does that necessarily mean it's not divisible by 4? Let me think. If n were divisible by 4, then it would be divisible by 8 only if it had another factor of 2. But since n is not divisible by 8, does that mean it's not divisible by 4? Hmm, not necessarily. For example, take 12. 12 is divisible by 4 and 6, but 12 is not divisible by 8. So 12 is divisible by 4. Therefore, n could be divisible by 4 even if it's not divisible by 8. So statement 3 is not necessarily true.\n\n4. **n leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 4**: Let's see. If n is divisible by 2 but not by 4, when you divide it by 4, the possible remainders are 1 or 2 or 3. Wait, no, if n is even (divisible by 2), then when divided by 4, the possible remainders are 0 or 2. Since n is not divisible by 4, it must leave a remainder of 2. For example, 6 divided by 4 leaves a remainder of 2, and 10 divided by 4 also leaves a remainder of 2. So yes, this must be true.\n\n5. **n leaves a remainder of 4 when divided by 8**: Hmm, if n is not divisible by 8, when you divide it by 8, the possible remainders are 1 through 7. But since n is divisible by 2, the possible remainders when divided by 8 are 0, 2, 4, 6. But n is not divisible by 8, so it can't leave a remainder of 0. So the possible remainders are 2, 4, or 6. However, does it have to leave a specific remainder like 4? Let's see with examples.\n\nTake n=6: 6 divided by 8 leaves a remainder of 6.\nTake n=10: 10 divided by 8 leaves a remainder of 2.\nTake n=14: 14 divided by 8 leaves a remainder of 6.\nTake n=18: 18 divided by 8 leaves a remainder of 2.\nTake n=22: 22 divided by 8 leaves a remainder of 6.\nTake n=26: 26 divided by 8 leaves a remainder of 2.\nTake n=30: 30 divided by 8 leaves a remainder of 6.\nAnd so on.\n\nSo it seems that n can leave remainders 2 or 6 when divided by 8. It doesn't necessarily have to leave a remainder of 4. Therefore, statement 5 is not necessarily true.\n\nSo, to recap:\n- Statement 1: Must be true (divisible by 3)\n- Statement 2: Must be true (divisible by 2)\n- Statement 3: Not necessarily true (could be divisible by 4)\n- Statement 4: Must be true (leaves remainder 2 when divided by 4)\n- Statement 5: Not necessarily true (could leave different remainders)\n\nTherefore, statements 1, 2, and 4 must be true.\n\nWait, but let me double-check statement 3. If n is not divisible by 8, does that mean it's not divisible by 4? No, because 4 is 2 squared, and n only needs one 2 to be divisible by 2, but not necessarily another 2 to be divisible by 4. So n could be divisible by 4 even if it's not divisible by 8. For example, 12 is divisible by 4 but not by 8. So statement 3 is not necessarily true.\n\nAnd for statement 4, since n is divisible by 2 but not by 4, when divided by 4, it must leave a remainder of 2. Because if it were divisible by 4, it would leave a remainder of 0. Since it's not, it must leave a remainder of 2. So yes, statement 4 must be true.\n\nSo the correct statements are 1, 2, and 4.\n</think>\n\n1. **n is divisible by 3**: True\n2. **n is divisible by 2**: True\n3. **n is divisible by 4**: Not necessarily true\n4. **n leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 4**: True\n5. **n leaves a remainder of 4 when divided by 8**: Not necessarily true\n\nThe statements that must be true are 1, 2, and 4.\n\nDONE."

It says, \"Consider a positive integer n. If we know that n is divisible by 6 but not divisible by 8, which of the following statements must be true?\" And then there are five statements to consider. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand what it means for n to be divisible by 6. If a number is divisible by 6, it means that it's divisible by both 2 and 3 because 6 is 2 times 3, and 2 and 3 are prime numbers. So, n must be even, and the sum of its digits must be divisible by 3. That gives me some basic information about n.\n\nNext, it says that n is not divisible by 8. Divisibility by 8 depends on the last three digits of the number. For example, 1000 is divisible by 8 because 000 is, but 1234 is not because 234 divided by 8 is 29.25, which isn't an integer. So, n doesn't end with 000, 008, 016, etc. That tells me something about the number's structure.\n\nNow, let's look at the statements one by one.\n\n1. **n is divisible by 3.**  \n   Since n is divisible by 6, and 6 is 2 times 3, n must be divisible by both 2 and 3. So, this statement is definitely true. That's straightforward.\n\n2. **n is divisible by 2.**  \n   Similarly, since n is divisible by 6, which includes 2, n must be even. So, this is also true. No issues here.\n\n3. **n is divisible by 4.**  \n   Hmm, this is a bit trickier. Divisibility by 4 requires that the last two digits form a number that's divisible by 4. Now, since n is divisible by 2, it's even, but not necessarily divisible by 4. For example, let's take n = 6. 6 is divisible by 2 and 3 but not by 4. So, 6 divided by 4 is 1.5, which isn't an integer. Therefore, n doesn't have to be divisible by 4. So, this statement isn't necessarily true.\n\n4. **n leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 4.**  \n   This is interesting. If n is not divisible by 4, then when divided by 4, it could leave a remainder of 1, 2, or 3. But does it have to leave a remainder of 2 specifically? Let's test with n = 6 again. 6 divided by 4 is 1 with a remainder of 2. That works. What about n = 18? 18 divided by 4 is 4 with a remainder of 2. Hmm, same result. Let's try n = 30. 30 divided by 4 is 7 with a remainder of 2. Again, same remainder. Wait, is this a pattern? Let's see. Since n is divisible by 6, it's 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, etc. Let's check each of these:\n\n   - 6 \u00f7 4 = 1 R2\n   - 12 \u00f7 4 = 3 R0 \u2192 Oh, wait, 12 is divisible by 4. But the problem states that n is not divisible by 8. So, 12 is divisible by 8? No, 12 \u00f7 8 = 1.5, so it's not divisible by 8. Wait, but 12 is divisible by 4. So, in this case, n = 12 would leave a remainder of 0 when divided by 4, which contradicts statement 4. So, statement 4 isn't necessarily true because n could be 12, which leaves a remainder of 0 when divided by 4. Therefore, this statement isn't always true.\n\n5. **n leaves a remainder of 4 when divided by 8.**  \n   Let's think about this. If n is not divisible by 8, then when divided by 8, it can leave remainders 1 through 7. But does it have to leave a remainder of 4 specifically? Let's test with n = 6. 6 \u00f7 8 = 0 R6. Not 4. n = 18 \u00f7 8 = 2 R2. Also not 4. n = 30 \u00f7 8 = 3 R6. Still not 4. What about n = 14? 14 \u00f7 8 = 1 R6. Not 4. n = 22 \u00f7 8 = 2 R6. Hmm, not 4. Wait, is there any n that is divisible by 6 and not by 8 but leaves a remainder of 4 when divided by 8?\n\n   Let's try n = 24. 24 \u00f7 8 = 3 R0. So, 24 is divisible by 8, which we know n is not. So, n can't be 24. What about n = 34? 34 \u00f7 8 = 4 R2. Not 4. n = 44 \u00f7 8 = 5 R4. Oh, here we go. 44 is divisible by 4 (since 44 \u00f7 4 = 11), but is it divisible by 6? Let's check. 44 \u00f7 6 = 7.333... So, no, 44 is not divisible by 6. Therefore, n = 44 is not in our consideration set because n must be divisible by 6. So, is there any number divisible by 6 and not by 8 that leaves a remainder of 4 when divided by 8?\n\n   Let's try to find such a number. Let's think about numbers that are divisible by 6 but not by 8. So, n = 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, 60, etc. Now, let's check each of these when divided by 8:\n\n   - 6 \u00f7 8 = 0 R6\n   - 12 \u00f7 8 = 1 R4\n   - 18 \u00f7 8 = 2 R2\n   - 24 \u00f7 8 = 3 R0\n   - 30 \u00f7 8 = 3 R6\n   - 36 \u00f7 8 = 4 R4\n   - 42 \u00f7 8 = 5 R2\n   - 48 \u00f7 8 = 6 R0\n   - 54 \u00f7 8 = 6 R6\n   - 60 \u00f7 8 = 7 R4\n\n   Okay, so looking at these, when n is 12, 36, or 60, it leaves a remainder of 4 when divided by 8. Now, let's check if these numbers are not divisible by 8. 12 \u00f7 8 = 1.5 \u2192 not divisible. 36 \u00f7 8 = 4.5 \u2192 not divisible. 60 \u00f7 8 = 7.5 \u2192 not divisible. So, these numbers fit the criteria: divisible by 6 but not by 8, and when divided by 8, they leave a remainder of 4.\n\n   Therefore, statement 5 is sometimes true, but is it necessarily true for all such n? Let's see. For example, n = 6. 6 \u00f7 8 = 0 R6. So, remainder 6, not 4. Therefore, statement 5 is not necessarily true for all such n. So, it's not a must.\n\n   Wait, but earlier when I thought about n = 12, 36, 60, they do leave remainder 4. So, sometimes it's true, but not always. Therefore, statement 5 isn't necessarily true.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\n1. True\n2. True\n3. Not necessarily true\n4. Not necessarily true\n5. Not necessarily true\n\nTherefore, the correct statements that must be true are 1 and 2.\n</think>\n\n1. **n is divisible by 3.**  \n   Since n is divisible by 6, it must be divisible by 3.  \n   **True.**\n\n2. **n is divisible by 2.**  \n   Similarly, being divisible by 6 means n is even.  \n   **True.**\n\n3. **n is divisible by 4.**  \n   Not necessarily. For example, 6 is divisible by 6 but not by 4.  \n   **False.**\n\n4. **n leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 4.**  \n   While some numbers like 6, 18, etc., do so, others like 12 do not.  \n   **False.**\n\n5. **n leaves a remainder of 4 when divided by 8.**  \n   Some numbers like 12, 36, 60 do, but others like 6 do not.  \n   **False.**\n\n**DONE.**"
