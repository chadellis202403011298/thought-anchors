If we know that n is divisible by 6 but not divisible by 8, which of the following statements must be true?\n1. n is divisible by 3\n2. n is divisible by 2\n3. n is divisible by 4\n4. n leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 4\n5. n leaves a remainder of 4 when divided by 8",
  "answer": "Let's analyze each statement using what we know about n:\n\nGiven information:\n- n is divisible by 6\n- n is not divisible by 8\n\nStatement 1: \"n is divisible by 3\"\nSince n is divisible by 6, and 6 = 2 \u00d7 3, we know that n must be divisible by 3.\nThis statement is true.\n\nStatement 2: \"n is divisible by 2\"\nSince n is divisible by 6, and 6 = 2 \u00d7 3, we know that n must be divisible by 2.\nThis statement is true.\n\nStatement 3: \"n is divisible by 4\"\nIf n were divisible by 4 and also by 3, then n would be divisible by 12 (the least common multiple of 3 and 4).\nSince 8 is a factor of 12, if n were divisible by 12, it would also be divisible by 8.\nBut we know n is not divisible by 8, so n cannot be divisible by 4.\nThis statement is false.\n\nStatement 4: \"n leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 4\"\nWe know n is divisible by 2 (from statement 2), so n = 2k for some integer k.\nWhen we divide n by 4, we get: n \u00f7 4 = 2k \u00f7 4 = k \u00f7 2.\nIf k is even, then n would be divisible by 4, which we proved is not possible.\nSo k must be odd, which means k \u00f7 2 gives a quotient and a remainder of 1/2.\nThus, n \u00f7 4 gives a remainder of 2.\nThis statement is true.\n\nStatement 5: \"n leaves a remainder of 4 when divided by 8\"\nWe can write n = 8q + r where 0 \u2264 r < 8 is the remainder when n is divided by 8.\nSince n is not divisible by 8, we know r \u2260 0.\nSince n is divisible by 6, we have n = 6m for some integer m.\nSo 6m = 8q + r, which means r = 6m - 8q = 2(3m - 4q).\nSince r is even (as a multiple of 2), and r \u2260 0, the possible values for r are 2, 4, or 6.\n\nTo determine which of these values r must have, recall that n is divisible by 2 but not by 4.\nIf r = 2, then n = 8q + 2 = 2(4q + 1). This is divisible by 2 but not by 4, which matches our conditions.\nIf r = 4, then n = 8q + 4 = 4(2q + 1). This is divisible by 4, which contradicts our findings above.\nIf r = 6, then n = 8q + 6 = 2(4q + 3). This is divisible by 2 but not by 4, which matches our conditions.\n\nSo r could be either 2 or 6. Since there are multiple possibilities, we cannot conclude that r must be 4.\nThis statement is false.\n\nIn conclusion, statements 1, 2, and 4 must be true."
