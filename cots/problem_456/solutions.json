The test has a 95% true positive rate (sensitivity), meaning that if someone has the disease, the test will correctly identify them as positive 95% of the time. The test also has a 90% true negative rate (specificity), meaning that if someone does not have the disease, the test will correctly identify them as negative 90% of the time. If a randomly selected person tests positive for the disease, what is the probability that they actually have the disease? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I've got this probability problem here about a disease test, and I need to figure out the probability that someone actually has the disease given that they tested positive. Hmm, sounds like a classic conditional probability question. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, let's parse the given information. Dr. Greene's test has a 95% true positive rate, which means if someone has the disease, there's a 95% chance the test will correctly identify them as positive. That's pretty high sensitivity. On the flip side, the test also has a 90% true negative rate, meaning if someone doesn't have the disease, there's a 90% chance the test will correctly say they're negative. So the specificity is pretty good too, but not as good as the sensitivity.\n\nThe question is asking: if a randomly selected person tests positive, what's the probability they actually have the disease? That sounds like a classic case for Bayes' Theorem. I remember Bayes' Theorem is used to update probabilities based on new information, which in this case is the test result being positive.\n\nBayes' Theorem formula is:\n\n\\[ P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A) \\cdot P(A)}{P(B)} \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( P(A|B) \\) is the probability of A given B.\n- \\( P(B|A) \\) is the probability of B given A.\n- \\( P(A) \\) is the prior probability of A.\n- \\( P(B) \\) is the total probability of B.\n\nIn this context:\n- Let A be the event that the person has the disease.\n- Let B be the event that the test result is positive.\n\nSo we need to find \\( P(A|B) \\), the probability they have the disease given they tested positive.\n\nWe know:\n- \\( P(B|A) \\) is the true positive rate, which is 95%, or 0.95.\n- \\( P(\\text{not } A|B) \\) is the false positive rate. Since the test's specificity is 90%, that means 10% of the time, people without the disease test positive. So \\( P(B|\\text{not } A) = 0.10 \\).\n- \\( P(A) \\) is the prevalence of the disease in the population, which is 1%, or 0.01.\n- \\( P(\\text{not } A) \\) is the probability of not having the disease, which is 99%, or 0.99.\n\nBut wait, I think I might have made a mistake there. The specificity is the true negative rate, which is the probability that the test correctly identifies someone without the disease as negative. So if the specificity is 90%, then the false positive rate is 10%, right? So \\( P(B|\\text{not } A) = 0.10 \\). That seems correct.\n\nNow, to apply Bayes' Theorem, I need to compute \\( P(B) \\), the total probability of testing positive. This can happen in two ways: either the person has the disease and tests positive, or they don't have the disease but still test positive. So:\n\n\\[ P(B) = P(B|A) \\cdot P(A) + P(B|\\text{not } A) \\cdot P(\\text{not } A) \\]\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n\\[ P(B) = 0.95 \\cdot 0.01 + 0.10 \\cdot 0.99 \\]\n\nLet me compute each part:\n\nFirst part: 0.95 * 0.01 = 0.0095\n\nSecond part: 0.10 * 0.99 = 0.099\n\nAdding them together: 0.0095 + 0.099 = 0.1085\n\nSo \\( P(B) = 0.1085 \\)\n\nNow, applying Bayes' Theorem:\n\n\\[ P(A|B) = \\frac{0.95 \\cdot 0.01}{0.1085} \\]\n\nCalculating the numerator: 0.95 * 0.01 = 0.0095\n\nSo:\n\n\\[ P(A|B) = \\frac{0.0095}{0.1085} \\]\n\nLet me compute that division:\n\n0.0095 divided by 0.1085. Hmm, I can think of it as 9.5 / 108.5, which is approximately 0.0875 or 8.75%.\n\nWait, let me double-check the calculation.\n\n0.0095 / 0.1085:\n\nDividing numerator and denominator by 0.0005 to make it easier:\n\n0.0095 / 0.0005 = 19\n\n0.1085 / 0.0005 = 217\n\nSo 19 / 217 \u2248 0.0878, which is approximately 8.78%.\n\nSo, roughly 8.8% chance that someone who tested positive actually has the disease.\n\nWait, that seems low, but considering the test has a high false positive rate (10%), it makes sense. Because for every 100 people, 1 has the disease and 99 don't. The test would correctly identify 95 of the 1 as positive, but incorrectly identify 10 of the 99 as positive. So total positives are 95 + 10 = 105. Out of these, only 95 are true positives. So the probability is 95 / 105 \u2248 0.9048, wait, that's not matching what I did earlier.\n\nWait, no, I think I messed up somewhere. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, in the problem, the prevalence is 1%, so in 100 people, 1 has the disease, 99 don't. The test correctly identifies 95% of the 1 as positive, so 0.95 * 1 = 0.95 true positives. For the 99 without the disease, the test correctly identifies 90% as negative, so 10% of 99 = 9.9 as false positives.\n\nSo total positives are 0.95 + 9.9 = 10.85. So the probability that someone who tested positive actually has the disease is 0.95 / 10.85 \u2248 0.0879, which is approximately 8.8%. So that's consistent with what I did earlier.\n\nWait, but earlier when I did the calculation, I got 0.0875, which is 8.75%, which is very close to 8.8%, so that's correct.\n\nSo the probability is approximately 8.8%.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations.\n\nLet me compute 0.0095 / 0.1085:\n\n0.0095 divided by 0.1085.\n\nLet me write it as 95 / 10850 (since 0.0095 is 95/10000 and 0.1085 is 1085/10000, so 95/1085).\n\nNow, 95 divided by 1085.\n\nLet me see: 1085 \u00f7 95. Let's see how many times 95 goes into 1085.\n\n95 * 11 = 1045\n\nSubtract: 1085 - 1045 = 40\n\nSo 95 goes into 1085 11 times with a remainder of 40.\n\nSo 95/1085 = 1/11.447, approximately 0.0878.\n\nYes, so that's about 8.78%.\n\nSo, the probability is approximately 8.8%.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't flip anything. Because sometimes with Bayes' Theorem, it's easy to mix up the terms.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n- P(A) = 0.01 (probability of disease)\n- P(not A) = 0.99 (probability of no disease)\n- P(B|A) = 0.95 (true positive rate)\n- P(B|not A) = 0.10 (false positive rate)\n\nThen, P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) + P(B|not A)P(not A) = 0.95*0.01 + 0.10*0.99 = 0.0095 + 0.099 = 0.1085\n\nThen P(A|B) = P(B|A)P(A)/P(B) = (0.95*0.01)/0.1085 \u2248 0.0095/0.1085 \u2248 0.0878 or 8.78%.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the probability that a person who tested positive actually has the disease is approximately 8.8%.\n\nI think that's it. So the final answer is approximately 8.8%, or more precisely, around 8.78%, which can be rounded to 8.8%.\n</think>\n\nThe probability that a person who tested positive actually has the disease is approximately 8.8%.\n\n**Answer:** The probability is 0.0878, or 8.8%.\n\nDONE."

If a randomly selected person tests positive for the disease, what is the probability that they actually have the disease? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out the probability that a randomly selected person actually has the disease given that they tested positive. Hmm, this sounds like a conditional probability problem. I remember something about Bayes' Theorem from my statistics class. Let me try to recall how that works.\n\nBayes' Theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of random events. The formula is:\n\nP(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)\n\nIn this context, I want to find the probability that the person has the disease given that they tested positive. So, let's define the events:\n\n- Let D be the event that the person has the disease.\n- Let T+ be the event that the test returns positive.\n\nSo, I need to find P(D|T+). According to Bayes' Theorem, this is equal to:\n\nP(D|T+) = [P(T+|D) * P(D)] / P(T+)\n\nI know some of these probabilities already. The problem states that the disease affects 1% of the population, so P(D) is 0.01. The test has a 95% true positive rate, which means P(T+|D) is 0.95. Now, I need to find P(T+), the total probability of testing positive.\n\nTo find P(T+), I should consider both the true positive rate and the false positive rate. The test has a 90% true negative rate, which means that 90% of the time, it correctly identifies a healthy person as negative. Therefore, the false positive rate is 10%, or 0.10. So, P(T+) can be calculated as:\n\nP(T+) = P(T+|D) * P(D) + P(T+|not D) * P(not D)\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nP(T+) = (0.95 * 0.01) + (0.10 * 0.99)\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n0.95 * 0.01 = 0.0095\n\n0.10 * 0.99 = 0.099\n\nAdding them together: 0.0095 + 0.099 = 0.1085\n\nSo, P(T+) is 0.1085.\n\nNow, plugging everything back into Bayes' Theorem:\n\nP(D|T+) = (0.95 * 0.01) / 0.1085\n\nCalculating the numerator: 0.95 * 0.01 = 0.0095\n\nThen, dividing by 0.1085:\n\n0.0095 / 0.1085 \u2248 0.0875\n\nSo, approximately 8.75% chance that the person actually has the disease given that they tested positive.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, P(D) is 0.01, P(T+|D) is 0.95, so 0.95 * 0.01 is indeed 0.0095.\n\nThen, P(not D) is 0.99, and P(T+|not D) is 0.10, so 0.10 * 0.99 is 0.099.\n\nAdding those gives 0.0095 + 0.099 = 0.1085. That seems correct.\n\nThen, 0.0095 divided by 0.1085. Let me do this division more precisely.\n\n0.0095 / 0.1085 = ?\n\nI can multiply numerator and denominator by 10000 to eliminate decimals:\n\n95 / 1085\n\nNow, let's divide 95 by 1085.\n\nFirst, 1085 goes into 95 zero times. So, we consider 1085 goes into 950 (adding a decimal point and a zero) how many times?\n\n1085 * 0.8 = 866\n\n1085 * 0.87 = 944.05\n\nSubtracting 944.05 from 950 gives 5.95\n\nBring down another zero: 59.5\n\n1085 goes into 59.5 about 0.05 times (since 1085 * 0.05 = 54.25)\n\nSo, total is approximately 0.875, which is 0.875 or 87.5%. Wait, that's different from my previous calculation. Hmm, I must have miscalculated earlier.\n\nWait, no, 0.0095 divided by 0.1085. Let me use a calculator approach.\n\n0.0095 \u00f7 0.1085 \u2248 0.0875 or 8.75%\n\nBut earlier, when I multiplied numerator and denominator by 10000, I got 95 / 1085 \u2248 0.0875, which is 8.75%. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but when I did 95 / 1085, I thought it was 0.875, but that's incorrect because 1085 * 0.875 = 944.125, which is less than 950. Wait, no, 1085 * 0.875 = 1085 * (7/8) = (1085 / 8) * 7 \u2248 135.625 * 7 \u2248 944.125. So, 944.125 is less than 950, meaning that 0.875 is too low.\n\nTo find 95 / 1085:\n\nLet me compute 1085 \u00f7 95 \u2248 11.421, so 1/11.421 \u2248 0.0875.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 95 / 1085 \u2248 0.0875, which is 8.75%.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the person actually has the disease given that they tested positive is approximately 8.75%.\n\nSo, final answer is 0.0875 or 8.75%. I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe probability that a randomly selected person actually has the disease given that they tested positive is approximately 8.75%.\n\n**Answer:** 0.0875 or 8.75%.\n\nDONE."

If a randomly selected person tests positive for the disease, what is the probability that they actually have the disease? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this problem about Dr. Greene's test for a rare disease. Let me try to wrap my head around it step by step. First, let's go over the problem again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nDr. Greene's test has a 95% true positive rate, which means if someone has the disease, the test will correctly identify them as positive 95% of the time. That's pretty high sensitivity. On the flip side, the test also has a 90% true negative rate, meaning that if someone doesn't have the disease, the test will correctly identify them as negative 90% of the time. So, pretty good specificity too.\n\nThe question is asking: If a randomly selected person tests positive for the disease, what is the probability that they actually have the disease? Hmm, this sounds like a conditional probability question. I think I need to use Bayes' Theorem here because it involves the probability of an event given that another event has occurred.\n\nBayes' Theorem formula is:\n\nP(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)\n\nIn this context:\n- Let A be the event that the person actually has the disease.\n- Let B be the event that the test tests positive.\n\nSo, we're looking for P(A|B), which is the probability that the person has the disease given that the test is positive.\n\nAlright, so I need to find P(A|B). According to Bayes' Theorem, that's equal to [P(B|A) * P(A)] divided by P(B).\n\nI know P(B|A) is the probability of testing positive given that you have the disease. That's the true positive rate, which is 95%, or 0.95.\n\nP(A) is the prior probability of having the disease. The problem says the disease affects 1% of the population, so P(A) is 0.01.\n\nNow, I need to find P(B), the overall probability of testing positive. This is a bit trickier because it's the total probability of testing positive, whether the person has the disease or not. To find this, I think I need to consider both the true positive rate and the false positive rate.\n\nWait, the test has a 90% true negative rate, which means 10% of the time, it incorrectly identifies a healthy person as positive. So, the false positive rate is 10%, or 0.10.\n\nSo, P(B) can be calculated by considering two scenarios:\n1. The person has the disease and tests positive.\n2. The person does not have the disease but tests positive anyway.\n\nThese two probabilities add up to the total probability of testing positive.\n\nSo, mathematically, that would be:\nP(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)\n\nI know P(B|A) is 0.95, P(A) is 0.01. P(B|not A) is the false positive rate, which is 0.10, and P(not A) is the probability of not having the disease, which is 1 - 0.01 = 0.99.\n\nPlugging these numbers in:\nP(B) = (0.95 * 0.01) + (0.10 * 0.99)\n\nLet me calculate that:\n0.95 * 0.01 = 0.0095\n0.10 * 0.99 = 0.099\nAdding them together: 0.0095 + 0.099 = 0.1085\n\nSo, P(B) is 0.1085.\n\nNow, going back to Bayes' Theorem:\nP(A|B) = (0.95 * 0.01) / 0.1085\n\nWe already calculated the numerator as 0.0095. So, 0.0095 divided by 0.1085.\n\nLet me do that division:\n0.0095 / 0.1085 \u2248 0.087\n\nSo, approximately 8.7% chance that someone who tested positive actually has the disease.\n\nWait, that seems low. Given that the disease is rare, only 1%, but the test is pretty good at picking up true positives. Hmm, but also, the test has a 10% false positive rate, which might be contributing to this low probability.\n\nLet me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nCalculating P(B):\n0.95 * 0.01 = 0.0095\n0.10 * 0.99 = 0.099\nAdding them gives 0.1085. That seems correct.\n\nThen, 0.0095 / 0.1085 \u2248 0.087, which is about 8.7%. Okay, that seems consistent.\n\nSo, the probability that someone who tested positive actually has the disease is approximately 8.7%.\n\nI think that makes sense because the disease is rare, so most people don't have it, but the test isn't perfect and has some false positives. So, even though the test is pretty accurate, the low prevalence of the disease means that most positive tests are false positives.\n\nYeah, that seems to align with the numbers. So, I think I've got it.\n</think>\n\nThe probability that a person who tested positive actually has the disease is approximately 8.7%.\n\nDONE."

Let me start by reading the question again to make sure I understand it.\n\nDr. Greene has developed a test for a rare disease that affects 1% of the population. The test has a 95% true positive rate, which means that if someone has the disease, the test will correctly identify them as positive 95% of the time. Additionally, the test has a 90% true negative rate, meaning that if someone doesn't have the disease, the test will correctly identify them as negative 90% of the time. The question is, if a randomly selected person tests positive for the disease, what is the probability that they actually have the disease?\n\nOkay, so this seems like a classic problem in probability, probably related to Bayes' Theorem. I remember that Bayes' Theorem allows us to find the probability of an event given some prior knowledge of conditions related to the event. In this case, we're trying to find the probability that someone actually has the disease given that the test came back positive.\n\nFirst, let me note down the given information:\n\n- Prevalence of the disease (let's call this P(D)) in the population is 1%, so P(D) = 0.01.\n- The test has a sensitivity of 95%, which is the probability that the test correctly identifies a diseased person as positive. So, P(T+ | D) = 0.95.\n- The test has a specificity of 90%, which is the probability that the test correctly identifies a healthy person as negative. So, P(T- | not D) = 0.90.\n\nWe need to find P(D | T+), the probability that someone has the disease given that the test is positive.\n\nBayes' Theorem states that:\n\nP(D | T+) = [P(T+ | D) * P(D)] / P(T+)\n\nSo, I need to calculate P(T+), the total probability that the test is positive. P(T+) can be broken down into two parts: the probability that someone has the disease and tests positive, plus the probability that someone doesn't have the disease but still tests positive.\n\nMathematically, that's:\n\nP(T+) = P(T+ | D) * P(D) + P(T+ | not D) * P(not D)\n\nI know P(T+ | D) is 0.95, P(D) is 0.01, P(T+ | not D) is 0.10 (since specificity is 90%, which is the probability of correctly identifying a non-disease as negative, so the probability of incorrectly identifying a non-disease as positive would be 1 - 0.90 = 0.10), and P(not D) is 1 - P(D) = 0.99.\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers:\n\nP(T+) = (0.95 * 0.01) + (0.10 * 0.99)\nLet me compute each part:\n\n0.95 * 0.01 = 0.0095\n0.10 * 0.99 = 0.099\n\nAdding them together: 0.0095 + 0.099 = 0.1085\n\nSo, P(T+) = 0.1085\n\nNow, going back to Bayes' Theorem:\n\nP(D | T+) = (0.95 * 0.01) / 0.1085 = 0.0095 / 0.1085\n\nLet me compute that division:\n\n0.0095 \u00f7 0.1085 \u2248 0.0875\n\nSo, the probability that someone actually has the disease given that they tested positive is approximately 8.75%.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, P(D) = 0.01, P(T+ | D) = 0.95, so 0.01 * 0.95 = 0.0095.\n\nP(not D) = 0.99, P(T+ | not D) = 0.10, so 0.99 * 0.10 = 0.099.\n\nAdding these gives 0.0095 + 0.099 = 0.1085 for P(T+). Then, 0.0095 / 0.1085 \u2248 0.0875, which is 8.75%.\n\nThat seems correct. So, the probability is approximately 8.75%, which is much lower than the initial 1% prevalence. This makes sense because the test isn't perfect; it has a high false positive rate (10% false positives). So, even though the disease is rare, the test's high false positive rate means that many people without the disease are testing positive, leading to a higher probability that a positive test result is a false positive.\n\nI think that's it. So, the final probability is about 8.75%.\n</think>\n\nThe probability that a randomly selected person who tested positive actually has the disease is approximately 8.75%.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Given Values:**\n   - Prevalence of the disease (P(D)) = 1% = 0.01\n   - Sensitivity (P(T+ | D)) = 95% = 0.95\n   - Specificity (P(T- | not D)) = 90% = 0.90\n   - Therefore, False Positive Rate = 1 - Specificity = 10% = 0.10\n\n2. **Calculate True Positives (TP):**\n   - TP = P(T+ | D) * P(D) = 0.95 * 0.01 = 0.0095\n\n3. **Calculate False Positives (FP):**\n   - FP = P(T+ | not D) * P(not D) = 0.10 * 0.99 = 0.099\n\n4. **Total Positive Tests (TP + FP):**\n   - P(T+) = TP + FP = 0.0095 + 0.099 = 0.1085\n\n5. **Apply Bayes' Theorem:**\n   - P(D | T+) = TP / P(T+) = 0.0095 / 0.1085 \u2248 0.0875 or 8.75%\n\n**Answer:** The probability that a person who tested positive actually has the disease is approximately 8.75%.\n\nDONE."

Hmm, this sounds like a conditional probability problem. I remember something about Bayes' Theorem from my statistics class. Let me recall how that works.\n\nFirst, I think I need to define the events involved. Let me denote:\n\n- D: the event that the person has the disease.\n- T+: the event that the test result is positive.\n\nI need to find P(D | T+), which is the probability of having the disease given a positive test result.\n\nBayes' Theorem states that:\n\nP(D | T+) = [P(T+ | D) * P(D)] / P(T+)\n\nOkay, so I have the sensitivity of the test, which is 95%, so P(T+ | D) is 0.95. The specificity is 90%, so P(T- | D') is 0.90, where D' is the event that the person does not have the disease.\n\nI also know that the prevalence of the disease is 1%, so P(D) is 0.01.\n\nBut wait, I need P(T+), the total probability of testing positive. To find this, I can use the law of total probability, which in this case would consider both the true positive rate and the false positive rate.\n\nP(T+) = P(T+ | D) * P(D) + P(T+ | D') * P(D')\n\nI already have P(T+ | D) = 0.95 and P(D) = 0.01. Now, I need to find P(T+ | D') and P(D').\n\nSince the specificity is 90%, P(T- | D') = 0.90, which means the false positive rate is 10%, so P(T+ | D') = 1 - 0.90 = 0.10.\n\nAlso, P(D') is the probability of not having the disease, which is 1 - P(D) = 0.99.\n\nNow, plugging these into the equation for P(T+):\n\nP(T+) = (0.95 * 0.01) + (0.10 * 0.99)\n\nLet me calculate each part:\n\n0.95 * 0.01 = 0.0095\n\n0.10 * 0.99 = 0.099\n\nAdding these together: 0.0095 + 0.099 = 0.1085\n\nSo, P(T+) is 0.1085.\n\nNow, going back to Bayes' Theorem:\n\nP(D | T+) = (0.95 * 0.01) / 0.1085 = 0.0095 / 0.1085\n\nLet me compute that division:\n\n0.0095 divided by 0.1085. Hmm, let's see. Maybe I can multiply numerator and denominator by 10000 to eliminate the decimals:\n\n95 / 1085\n\nNow, simplifying this fraction. Let's see if 95 divides into 1085.\n\n1085 divided by 95: 95 * 11 = 1045, which is less than 1085. 1085 - 1045 = 40. So 95 * 11.42... Wait, maybe a better approach is to divide both numerator and denominator by 5:\n\n95 \u00f7 5 = 19\n\n1085 \u00f7 5 = 217\n\nSo now it's 19/217.\n\nI don't think 19 divides into 217 evenly. Let me check: 19*11=209, 19*11.4=216.6, so approximately 11.42.\n\nSo, 19/217 \u2248 0.0879, or 8.79%.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, P(T+) = 0.95*0.01 + 0.10*0.99 = 0.0095 + 0.099 = 0.1085.

The test also has a 90% true negative rate (specificity), meaning that if someone does not have the disease, the test will correctly identify them as negative 90% of the time. If a randomly selected person tests positive for the disease, what is the probability that they actually have the disease? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out the probability that someone actually has the disease given that they tested positive. Hmm, okay, let's break this down. I remember this is a classic problem in probability and statistics, something about Bayes' Theorem maybe? Yeah, that sounds right.\n\nFirst, let's get the given information clear. The disease affects 1% of the population. So, the prevalence of the disease is 1%, or 0.01 in decimal. That means if I pick a random person, there's a 1% chance they have the disease and a 99% chance they don't.\n\nNow, the test has a 95% true positive rate. So, if someone has the disease, the test will correctly say they're positive 95% of the time. That translates to a sensitivity of 95%, or 0.95. That's pretty accurate.\n\nOn the flip side, the test also has a 90% true negative rate, which is the specificity. So, if someone doesn't have the disease, the test will correctly say they're negative 90% of the time. That's 0.90 specificity.\n\nThe question is asking: Given that someone tested positive, what's the probability they actually have the disease? That's a conditional probability problem. I think Bayes' Theorem is exactly what we need here.\n\nBayes' Theorem formula is:\n\nP(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)\n\nIn this context:\n- A is the event that the person has the disease.\n- B is the event that the test result is positive.\n\nSo, plugging in the values:\n- P(A) is the prior probability of having the disease, which is 1% or 0.01.\n- P(B|A) is the probability of testing positive given that you have the disease, which is the sensitivity, 95% or 0.95.\n- P(B) is the total probability of testing positive, which includes both true positives and false positives.\n\nSo, I need to calculate P(B). How do I do that? Well, P(B) can be broken down into two parts:\n1. The probability of testing positive when you actually have the disease (true positive).\n2. The probability of testing positive when you don't have the disease (false positive).\n\nMathematically, that's:\nP(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)\n\nWhere:\n- P(B|A) is 0.95 (true positive rate).\n- P(A) is 0.01.\n- P(B|not A) is the false positive rate, which is 1 - specificity, so 1 - 0.90 = 0.10.\n- P(not A) is the probability of not having the disease, which is 1 - 0.01 = 0.99.\n\nSo plugging those numbers in:\nP(B) = (0.95 * 0.01) + (0.10 * 0.99)\n\nLet me calculate that:\nFirst part: 0.95 * 0.01 = 0.0095\nSecond part: 0.10 * 0.99 = 0.099\nAdding them together: 0.0095 + 0.099 = 0.1085\n\nSo, P(B) is 0.1085.\n\nNow, going back to Bayes' Theorem:\nP(A|B) = (0.95 * 0.01) / 0.1085\n\nWhich is:\nP(A|B) = 0.0095 / 0.1085\n\nLet me compute that division. 0.0095 divided by 0.1085.\n\nHmm, let me think. 0.0095 is approximately 9.5, and 0.1085 is approximately 108.5. So, 9.5 / 108.5 is roughly 0.0875, which is 8.75%.\n\nWait, let me do it more accurately. Let's see:\n\n0.0095 / 0.1085\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by 10000 to eliminate decimals:\n\n95 / 1085\n\nSimplify this fraction. Let's see if 5 divides both:\n\n95 \u00f7 5 = 19\n\n1085 \u00f7 5 = 217\n\nSo, 19/217. Let me check if these can be simplified further. 19 is a prime number. 217 \u00f7 19 is approximately 11.421, which isn't an integer, so 19 and 217 don't have common factors besides 1.\n\nSo, 19/217 is approximately 0.087791, which is about 8.79%.\n\nSo, the probability that someone actually has the disease given a positive test result is approximately 8.79%.\n\nWait, that seems low. Only about 8.8% chance? Considering the disease is rare, and the test isn't perfect, that makes sense. Because most people don't have the disease, but the test has some false positives.\n\nLet me double-check the calculations to be sure.\n\nCompute P(B):\n0.95 * 0.01 = 0.0095\n0.10 * 0.99 = 0.099\nAdding them: 0.0095 + 0.099 = 0.1085\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nThen, 0.0095 / 0.1085 = 0.087791, which is approximately 8.79%.\n\nSo, yeah, that seems accurate.\n\nI think that's the answer. It's always a bit counterintuitive because even though the test is pretty accurate, the disease is rare, so the number of false positives outweighs the true positives, leading to a lower probability than one might initially think.\n</think>\n\nThe probability that a randomly selected person who tested positive actually has the disease is approximately 8.8%.\n\n**Answer:** The probability is 8.8%.\n\nDONE."
