  "question": "Dr. Greene has developed a test for a rare disease that affects 1% of the population. The test has a 95% true positive rate (sensitivity), meaning that if someone has the disease, the test will correctly identify them as positive 95% of the time. The test also has a 90% true negative rate (specificity), meaning that if someone does not have the disease, the test will correctly identify them as negative 90% of the time. If a randomly selected person tests positive for the disease, what is the probability that they actually have the disease?",
  "answer": "This problem involves calculating the probability of having the disease given a positive test result using Bayes' theorem.\n\nStep 1: Define our variables:\n- P(D) = probability of having the disease = 0.01 (1% of population)\n- P(~D) = probability of not having the disease = 0.99 (99% of population)\n- P(+|D) = probability of testing positive given that you have the disease = 0.95 (95% sensitivity)\n- P(+|~D) = probability of testing positive given that you don't have the disease = 0.10 (10% false positive rate, since specificity is 90%)\n\nStep 2: Apply Bayes' theorem to find P(D|+), the probability of having the disease given a positive test:\n\nP(D|+) = [P(+|D) \u00d7 P(D)] / [P(+|D) \u00d7 P(D) + P(+|~D) \u00d7 P(~D)]\n\nStep 3: Substitute the values:\n\nP(D|+) = [0.95 \u00d7 0.01] / [0.95 \u00d7 0.01 + 0.10 \u00d7 0.99]\n       = 0.0095 / [0.0095 + 0.099]\n       = 0.0095 / 0.1085\n       = 0.0876 (rounded to 4 decimal places)\n       = 8.76%\n\nTherefore, if a randomly selected person tests positive for the disease, there is only about an 8.76% probability that they actually have the disease. This demonstrates how even with a good test, when the base rate of a condition is low, most positive results will be false positives - a key insight from Bayesian reasoning."
