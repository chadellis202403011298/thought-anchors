End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: Consider the following sequence of transformations:\n\n'ABC' \u2192 'BDF'\n'DEF' \u2192 'EHI'\n'GHI' \u2192 'HKL'\n'JKL' \u2192 '???'\n\nWhat is the result of the final transformation? Identify the rule that governs how one string transforms into another. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I've got this sequence of transformations here, and I need to figure out what the final transformation leads to. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the transformations given are:\n\n1. 'ABC' \u2192 'BDF'\n2. 'DEF' \u2192 'EHI'\n3. 'GHI' \u2192 'HKL'\n4. 'JKL' \u2192 '???\n\nI need to find out what 'JKL' transforms into and also figure out the rule that's governing these transformations.\n\nOkay, let's start by looking at the first transformation: 'ABC' becomes 'BDF'. Hmm, so the first letter 'A' becomes 'B', 'B' becomes 'D', and 'C' becomes 'F'. That seems like each letter is being shifted by some number of places in the alphabet.\n\nLet me check: 'A' to 'B' is +1, 'B' to 'D' is +2, and 'C' to 'F' is +3. Wait, that doesn't seem consistent. Maybe it's not a simple shift. Alternatively, maybe it's a rotation within the alphabet, but I'm not sure.\n\nLet's look at the second transformation: 'DEF' becomes 'EHI'. So 'D' becomes 'E', 'E' becomes 'H', and 'F' becomes 'I'. Again, let's see the shifts:\n\n'D' to 'E' is +1, 'E' to 'H' is +3, and 'F' to 'I' is +4. Hmm, not consistent again. Maybe it's not a straightforward shift.\n\nThird transformation: 'GHI' becomes 'HKL'. 'G' becomes 'H' (+1), 'H' becomes 'K' (+2), and 'I' becomes 'L' (+3). Okay, now that seems consistent. Each letter is shifted by +1, +2, and +3 respectively.\n\nWait, let me double-check:\n\n- 'G' \u2192 'H' is +1\n- 'H' \u2192 'K' is +2\n- 'I' \u2192 'L' is +3\n\nSo, each subsequent letter in the word is shifted by an incrementing number starting from 1. So, first letter +1, second letter +2, third letter +3, and so on.\n\nBut wait, let's check the first transformation again with this in mind:\n\n- 'A' \u2192 'B' is +1\n- 'B' \u2192 'D' is +2\n- 'C' \u2192 'F' is +3\n\nYes, that fits. So, each letter in the word is shifted by an incrementing number starting from 1, where the first letter is shifted by 1, the second by 2, the third by 3, etc.\n\nSo, applying this rule to the first three transformations:\n\n1. 'ABC' \u2192 'BDF' (A+1=B, B+2=D, C+3=F)\n2. 'DEF' \u2192 'EHI' (D+1=E, E+2=G? Wait, no, the result is 'EHI', so 'D'\u2192'E' is +1, 'E'\u2192'H' is +3, 'F'\u2192'I' is +4. Wait, that doesn't fit the same pattern as before. Hmm, inconsistency here.\n\nWait, maybe I miscounted. Let's recount:\n\nIn the second transformation, 'DEF' becomes 'EHI':\n\n- D (4) \u2192 E (5): +1\n- E (5) \u2192 H (8): +3\n- F (6) \u2192 I (9): +3\n\nWait, that's inconsistent. The first shift is +1, the second is +3, and the third is +3. That doesn't fit the pattern.\n\nSimilarly, the third transformation: 'GHI' \u2192 'HKL'\n\n- G (7) \u2192 H (8): +1\n- H (8) \u2192 K (11): +3\n- I (9) \u2192 L (12): +3\n\nAgain, first shift +1, the next two shifts are +3.\n\nWait, that's inconsistent with the first transformation. So maybe the rule is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each word is shifted cyclically within a certain set of letters.\n\nLooking at the first transformation again: 'ABC' \u2192 'BDF'\n\nSo, A\u2192B, B\u2192D, C\u2192F.\n\nIf I think of the alphabet as a circle, A to B is +1, B to D is +2, C to F is +4. That doesn't fit a consistent shift.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a Caesar cipher with a shift of +1, but with some exceptions. But that doesn't seem to hold.\n\nWait, maybe it's not about shifting each letter individually, but rather replacing each letter with another based on a pattern.\n\nLooking at the letters:\n\nIn the first transformation, ABC \u2192 BDF.\n\nSo, A\u2192B, B\u2192D, C\u2192F.\n\nSimilarly, DEF \u2192 EHI.\n\nD\u2192E, E\u2192H, F\u2192I.\n\nGHI \u2192 HKL.\n\nG\u2192H, H\u2192K, I\u2192L.\n\nHmm, so each word is being transformed by shifting each letter forward by a certain number, but the shift seems to be increasing by 1 each time.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nFirst word: ABC\n\nA shifted by +1 \u2192 B\n\nB shifted by +2 \u2192 D\n\nC shifted by +3 \u2192 F\n\nSo, 1,2,3.\n\nSecond word: DEF\n\nD shifted by +1 \u2192 E\n\nE shifted by +2 \u2192 G\n\nF shifted by +3 \u2192 I\n\nBut the result is EHI, not EGI. So that doesn't match. Wait, the result is EHI, so E\u2192H is +3, F\u2192I is +3.\n\nWait, that's different. So, in the first transformation, the shifts are 1,2,3, but in the second, they're 1,3,3. That doesn't fit a consistent pattern.\n\nWait, perhaps the shifts are based on the position within the word.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe each letter is being replaced by the next letter in the alphabet, but with some wrapping around.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's based on the position in the word: the first letter is shifted by 1, the second by 2, etc.\n\nWait, but in the first transformation, ABC \u2192 BDF.\n\nSo, A(1) +1=B(2), B(2)+2=D(4), C(3)+3=F(6). So, that works.\n\nIn the second transformation, DEF\u2192EHI.\n\nD(4)+1=E(5), E(5)+2=G(7), F(6)+3=I(9). But the result is EHI, so E(5), H(8), I(9). So, D\u2192E (+1), E\u2192H (+3), F\u2192I (+3). That doesn't fit the same pattern as the first transformation.\n\nWait, maybe the second transformation is a different shift. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different rule.\n\nWait, let's look at the third transformation: GHI \u2192 HKL.\n\nG(7)+1=H(8), H(8)+2=K(11), I(9)+3=L(12). So, that fits the 1,2,3 pattern.\n\nBut the second transformation doesn't fit that pattern. So, perhaps the rule is that each word is shifted by 1,2,3,... but starting from the first word, and each subsequent word starts the shift again.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because the second transformation doesn't follow that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shift increments by 2 each time.\n\nWait, first transformation: shifts 1,2,3.\n\nSecond transformation: shifts 1,3,4? But that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the shift is based on the previous transformation.\n\nWait, let's try to see if there's a pattern in the transformations.\n\nFirst transformation: ABC \u2192 BDF.\n\nSecond: DEF \u2192 EHI.\n\nThird: GHI \u2192 HKL.\n\nFourth: JKL \u2192 ??\n\nLooking at the results, the first letters are B, E, H, and the next letters are D, H, K. So, B, E, H... that's the sequence B, E, H, which are every third letter starting from B: B(2), E(5), H(8), J(10), etc. Wait, but in the second transformation, the first letter is E, which is the 5th letter. Then H is the 8th, which is +3 from E. So, B, E, H, J, etc., each time +3.\n\nSimilarly, the second letters: D(4), H(8), K(11). So, D, H, K, each +3.\n\nThird letters: F(6), I(9), L(12). Again, each +3.\n\nWait, that seems consistent. So, perhaps each transformation is taking the previous word and shifting each letter by +3.\n\nWait, but let's check:\n\nFirst transformation: ABC \u2192 BDF.\n\nIf we shift each letter by +3:\n\nA(1)+3=D(4), B(2)+3=E(5), C(3)+3=F(6). But the result is BDF, not DEF. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe it's a different shift. Alternatively, perhaps it's a rotation within the word.\n\nWait, another approach: looking at the first letters: B, E, H, which are 2,5,8,... that's an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 3. Similarly, the second letters: D(4), H(8), K(11), which is 4,8,11,... also a common difference of 3. Third letters: F(6), I(9), L(12), again 6,9,12, difference of 3.\n\nSo, each position in the word is being shifted by +3 each time.\n\nWait, but let's check:\n\nFirst transformation: ABC \u2192 BDF.\n\nIf each letter is shifted by +3:\n\nA\u2192D, B\u2192E, C\u2192F. So, DEF, not BDF. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, but the result is BDF, which is B, D, F.\n\nHmm, perhaps the shift is not the same for each position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a rotation within the word.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nABC \u2192 BDF.\n\nIf we rotate the letters, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each letter is being replaced by the letter three positions ahead in the alphabet.\n\nSo, A\u2192D, B\u2192E, C\u2192F. That would make ABC\u2192DEF, but the result is BDF. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, but in the first transformation, ABC\u2192BDF.\n\nSo, A\u2192B, B\u2192D, C\u2192F.\n\nIf I think of A as being shifted by +1, B by +2, C by +3. So, the shift increments by 1 each time.\n\nSimilarly, in the second transformation, DEF\u2192EHI.\n\nD shifted by +1=E, E shifted by +2=G, F shifted by +3=I. But the result is EHI, so E, H, I. So, D\u2192E (+1), E\u2192H (+3), F\u2192I (+3). That doesn't fit the same pattern as the first transformation.\n\nWait, perhaps the shift for each position is based on its position in the word.\n\nIn the first word, ABC:\n\nFirst letter A shifted by +1 \u2192 B\n\nSecond letter B shifted by +2 \u2192 D\n\nThird letter C shifted by +3 \u2192 F\n\nSo, shifts are 1,2,3.\n\nIn the second word, DEF:\n\nFirst letter D shifted by +1 \u2192 E\n\nSecond letter E shifted by +2 \u2192 G\n\nThird letter F shifted by +3 \u2192 I\n\nBut the result is EHI, which is E, H, I. So, E shifted by +3\u2192H, F shifted by +3\u2192I. That's inconsistent with the first word.\n\nWait, maybe the shifts are based on the position in the sequence of transformations.\n\nFirst transformation: ABC\u2192BDF, shifts 1,2,3.\n\nSecond transformation: DEF\u2192EHI, shifts 1,3,3.\n\nThird transformation: GHI\u2192HKL, shifts 1,2,3.\n\nHmm, that's inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shift for each position is the position number.\n\nSo, in the first word, ABC:\n\nA (position 1) shifted by +1 \u2192 B\n\nB (position 2) shifted by +2 \u2192 D\n\nC (position 3) shifted by +3 \u2192 F\n\nSo, that works.\n\nIn the second word, DEF:\n\nD (position 1) shifted by +1 \u2192 E\n\nE (position 2) shifted by +2 \u2192 G\n\nF (position 3) shifted by +3 \u2192 I\n\nBut the result is EHI, which is E, H, I.\n\nSo, E shifted by +3\u2192H, F shifted by +3\u2192I.\n\nThat doesn't fit the same pattern.\n\nWait, maybe the shift for each position is the position number, but starting from a different point.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shift is based on the previous transformation.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck here. Let's try a different approach.\n\nLooking at the first transformation: ABC\u2192BDF.\n\nLetters: A\u2192B, B\u2192D, C\u2192F.\n\nSo, A(1)\u2192B(2): +1\n\nB(2)\u2192D(4): +2\n\nC(3)\u2192F(6): +3\n\nSo, shifts are +1, +2, +3.\n\nSimilarly, in the second transformation: DEF\u2192EHI.\n\nD(4)\u2192E(5): +1\n\nE(5)\u2192H(8): +3\n\nF(6)\u2192I(9): +3\n\nWait, so the first shift is +1, then +3, then +3.\n\nHmm, inconsistent.\n\nThird transformation: GHI\u2192HKL.\n\nG(7)\u2192H(8): +1\n\nH(8)\u2192K(11): +3\n\nI(9)\u2192L(12): +3\n\nAgain, first shift +1, then +3, then +3.\n\nWait, so perhaps after the first transformation, the shifts change.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shift is based on the word's position.\n\nFirst transformation: ABC\u2192BDF, shifts +1, +2, +3.\n\nSecond transformation: DEF\u2192EHI, shifts +1, +3, +3.\n\nThird transformation: GHI\u2192HKL, shifts +1, +3, +3.\n\nSo, maybe starting from the second transformation, the shifts are +1, +3, +3.\n\nBut that doesn't make a clear pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shift for each position is equal to the position number, but in the second transformation, the shifts are different.\n\nWait, maybe it's a combination of position and something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each letter is being replaced by the next letter in a cycle of three letters.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nIn the first transformation, ABC\u2192BDF.\n\nSo, A\u2192B, B\u2192D, C\u2192F.\n\nIf we think of A, B, C as being replaced by B, D, F, which are the next letters in some pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a substitution cipher where each letter is replaced by another based on a specific rule.\n\nWait, let's list the substitutions:\n\nFrom ABC\u2192BDF:\n\nA\u2192B\n\nB\u2192D\n\nC\u2192F\n\nFrom DEF\u2192EHI:\n\nD\u2192E\n\nE\u2192H\n\nF\u2192I\n\nFrom GHI\u2192HKL:\n\nG\u2192H\n\nH\u2192K\n\nI\u2192L\n\nSo, looking at these substitutions:\n\nA\u2192B\n\nB\u2192D\n\nC\u2192F\n\nD\u2192E\n\nE\u2192H\n\nF\u2192I\n\nG\u2192H\n\nH\u2192K\n\nI\u2192L\n\nSo, let's see if there's a pattern here.\n\nFrom A\u2192B, B\u2192D, C\u2192F: it seems like each letter is being shifted by +1, +2, +3 respectively.\n\nSimilarly, D\u2192E (+1), E\u2192H (+3), F\u2192I (+3).\n\nG\u2192H (+1), H\u2192K (+3), I\u2192L (+3).\n\nSo, perhaps the shift for the first letter is +1, and for the second and third letters, it's +3.\n\nBut that's inconsistent with the first transformation where all three letters have shifts of +1, +2, +3.\n\nWait, maybe the shift depends on the position in the word.\n\nIn the first word ABC:\n\n- First letter A shifted by +1 \u2192 B\n\n- Second letter B shifted by +2 \u2192 D\n\n- Third letter C shifted by +3 \u2192 F\n\nIn the second word DEF:\n\n- First letter D shifted by +1 \u2192 E\n\n- Second letter E shifted by +3 \u2192 H\n\n- Third letter F shifted by +3 \u2192 I\n\nIn the third word GHI:\n\n- First letter G shifted by +1 \u2192 H\n\n- Second letter H shifted by +3 \u2192 K\n\n- Third letter I shifted by +3 \u2192 L\n\nSo, the pattern seems to be that in the first transformation, the shifts are +1, +2, +3, but in the subsequent transformations, the shifts for the second and third letters are +3.\n\nWait, that seems inconsistent. Maybe the shift for the second and third letters is always +3 after the first transformation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shift for the first letter is always +1, and the shift for the second and third letters is +3.\n\nBut in the first transformation, the second letter shift was +2, not +3.\n\nWait, maybe the shift for the second letter is equal to the position in the sequence of transformations.\n\nFirst transformation: position 1, second letter shift +2.\n\nSecond transformation: position 2, second letter shift +3.\n\nThird transformation: position 3, second letter shift +3.\n\nHmm, that might not make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shift for each position is equal to the position number in the word.\n\nSo, first letter shift +1, second letter shift +2, third letter shift +3.\n\nBut in the second transformation, the second letter shift was +3 instead of +2.\n\nWait, maybe the shift for the second letter is equal to the position in the word.\n\nIn the first transformation, second letter shifted by +2.\n\nIn the second transformation, second letter shifted by +3.\n\nIn the third transformation, second letter shifted by +3.\n\nSo, perhaps after the first transformation, the second letter shift increases by 1 each time.\n\nBut that seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shift for the second letter is equal to the word's position.\n\nFirst transformation: position 1, second letter shift +2.\n\nSecond transformation: position 2, second letter shift +3.\n\nThird transformation: position 3, second letter shift +3.\n\nHmm, not a clear pattern.\n\nWait, maybe the shift for the second letter is equal to the word's position.\n\nSo, first transformation: position 1, second letter shift +2.\n\nSecond transformation: position 2, second letter shift +3.\n\nThird transformation:"

Identify the rule that governs how one string transforms into another. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I've got this problem here with a sequence of transformations:\n\n'ABC' \u2192 'BDF'\n'DEF' \u2192 'EHI'\n'GHI' \u2192 'HKL'\n'JKL' \u2192 '???'\n\nAnd I need to figure out what the final transformation is and identify the rule that governs these changes. Let me start by looking at each transformation one by one to see if I can spot a pattern or a rule.\n\nFirst, 'ABC' becomes 'BDF'. Let me write down the letters:\n\nA \u2192 B\nB \u2192 D\nC \u2192 F\n\nHmm, that's interesting. So each letter is being replaced by the next letter in the alphabet. Let's check:\n\nA is the first letter, so B is the second.\nB is the second, so C would be the third, but here B becomes D, which is the fourth. Wait, that doesn't match. So maybe it's not just shifting by one.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's shifting by two. Let's see:\n\nA shifted by two is C, but here A becomes B. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe it's not a simple shift. Let me look at the next transformation to see if it gives more clues.\n\n'DEF' becomes 'EHI'. Let's map the letters:\n\nD \u2192 E\nE \u2192 H\nF \u2192 I\n\nOkay, so D is the fourth letter, becomes E, which is the fifth. E is the fifth, becomes H, which is the eighth. F is the sixth, becomes I, which is the ninth.\n\nHmm, that's a bigger jump. D to E is +1, E to H is +3, F to I is +3. Not sure if that's consistent.\n\nWait, let's see if there's another pattern. Maybe it's related to the positions in the word or something else.\n\nLooking at 'ABC' \u2192 'BDF', which is also three letters. 'DEF' \u2192 'EHI', also three letters. 'GHI' \u2192 'HKL', three letters. So each transformation keeps the length the same.\n\nMaybe it's a cyclic shift within the alphabet? Let's check:\n\nIn 'ABC' to 'BDF', each letter is shifted by +1: A\u2192B, B\u2192C, C\u2192D, but here it's B\u2192D, which is +2, and C\u2192F, which is +3. That doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe it's based on the positions in the word. Let's see:\n\nIn 'ABC', A is the first letter, becomes B, which is the second letter.\nB is the second letter, becomes D, which is the fourth letter.\nC is the third letter, becomes F, which is the sixth letter.\n\nSo, first letter becomes second letter, second becomes fourth, third becomes sixth. That seems like moving two positions forward.\n\nSimilarly, in 'DEF' \u2192 'EHI':\n\nD is the first letter, becomes E (second letter).\nE is the second letter, becomes H (eighth letter).\nF is the third letter, becomes I (ninth letter).\n\nWait, that doesn't fit the two positions forward. D\u2192E is +1, E\u2192H is +3, F\u2192I is +3. Hmm, inconsistent.\n\nMaybe it's a different rule. Let's look at the third transformation: 'GHI' \u2192 'HKL'.\n\nG \u2192 H\nH \u2192 K\nI \u2192 L\n\nSo G is the seventh letter, becomes H (eighth). H is eighth, becomes K (eleventh). I is ninth, becomes L (twelfth).\n\nSo that's +1 each time. So G\u2192H, H\u2192K (+2), I\u2192L (+2). Wait, that's inconsistent again.\n\nWait, maybe it's based on the previous transformation. Let's see:\n\nFrom 'ABC' \u2192 'BDF', which is +1, +2, +3.\nThen 'DEF' \u2192 'EHI', which is +1, +3, +3.\nThen 'GHI' \u2192 'HKL', which is +1, +2, +2.\n\nHmm, not a clear pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's based on the letters themselves, like moving a certain number of places forward in the alphabet. Let's see:\n\nIn 'ABC' \u2192 'BDF':\n\nA (1) \u2192 B (2): +1\nB (2) \u2192 D (4): +2\nC (3) \u2192 F (6): +3\n\nSo the shifts are +1, +2, +3.\n\nIn 'DEF' \u2192 'EHI':\n\nD (4) \u2192 E (5): +1\nE (5) \u2192 H (8): +3\nF (6) \u2192 I (9): +3\n\nSo shifts are +1, +3, +3.\n\nIn 'GHI' \u2192 'HKL':\n\nG (7) \u2192 H (8): +1\nH (8) \u2192 K (11): +3\nI (9) \u2192 L (12): +3\n\nAgain, shifts are +1, +3, +3.\n\nWait, so the pattern seems to be that the first letter shifts by +1, and the subsequent letters shift by +3 each time. Let's check:\n\nABC \u2192 BDF:\n\nA(1)+1=B(2)\nB(2)+2=C(3) \u2192 but D is 4, so +2? Wait, no, in the first transformation, B becomes D, which is +2, and C becomes F, which is +3.\n\nWait, maybe it's that each subsequent letter shifts by an incrementing number. Like first letter shifts by +1, second by +2, third by +3.\n\nBut in 'ABC' \u2192 'BDF':\n\nA(1)+1=B(2)\nB(2)+2=D(4)\nC(3)+3=F(6)\n\nYes, that fits.\n\nThen 'DEF' \u2192 'EHI':\n\nD(4)+1=E(5)\nE(5)+2=G(7) \u2192 but here E becomes H, which is +3.\n\nWait, that doesn't fit. So maybe the shifts are not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's based on the previous transformation's shift.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nFrom ABC to BDF: shifts are +1, +2, +3.\n\nThen DEF to EHI: shifts are +1, +3, +3.\n\nThen GHI to HKL: shifts are +1, +3, +3.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be that the first letter always shifts by +1, and the second and third letters shift by +3 each time.\n\nSo, applying that to 'JKL' \u2192 ???.\n\nLet's map it out:\n\nJ is the tenth letter. Shift by +1 \u2192 K.\n\nK is the eleventh letter. Shift by +3 \u2192 L.\n\nL is the twelfth letter. Shift by +3 \u2192 M.\n\nWait, but the previous transformations had the second and third letters shifting by +3.\n\nSo JKL \u2192 K (from J+1), L (from K+3), M (from L+3).\n\nSo 'JKL' becomes 'KLM'.\n\nBut wait, let's double-check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's that each letter is shifted by the position in the word.\n\nLike, in 'ABC', the first letter shifts by +1, the second by +2, the third by +3.\n\nSimilarly, in 'DEF', first letter +1, second +3, third +3.\n\nWait, that seems inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's based on the previous transformation's shifts.\n\nIn ABC \u2192 BDF: shifts are +1, +2, +3.\n\nThen DEF \u2192 EHI: shifts are +1, +3, +3.\n\nThen GHI \u2192 HKL: shifts are +1, +3, +3.\n\nSo the pattern is that the first letter shifts by +1, and the other letters shift by +3 each time.\n\nSo for 'JKL':\n\nJ (10) +1 = K (11)\n\nK (11) +3 = L (14)\n\nL (12) +3 = M (15)\n\nSo 'JKL' becomes 'KLM'.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a rotation within the word. Let me check.\n\nAnother approach: look at the transformations as replacing each letter with the next letter in the alphabet, but with a cycle. For example, after Z comes A again.\n\nBut in the first transformation, C becomes F, which is +3, not +1. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe it's based on the position in the word. Let's see:\n\nIn 'ABC', each letter is replaced by the next letter two positions ahead.\n\nA \u2192 B (A is 1, B is 2: +1)\nWait, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's based on the letters themselves. Let's see:\n\nIn 'ABC' \u2192 'BDF':\n\nA (1) \u2192 B (2): +1\nB (2) \u2192 D (4): +2\nC (3) \u2192 F (6): +3\n\nSo shifts are +1, +2, +3.\n\nIn 'DEF' \u2192 'EHI':\n\nD (4) \u2192 E (5): +1\nE (5) \u2192 H (8): +3\nF (6) \u2192 I (9): +3\n\nSo shifts are +1, +3, +3.\n\nIn 'GHI' \u2192 'HKL':\n\nG (7) \u2192 H (8): +1\nH (8) \u2192 K (11): +3\nI (9) \u2192 L (12): +3\n\nAgain, +1, +3, +3.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be that the first letter shifts by +1, and the second and third letters shift by +3 each time.\n\nTherefore, applying this to 'JKL':\n\nJ (10) +1 = K (11)\n\nK (11) +3 = L (14)\n\nL (12) +3 = M (15)\n\nSo 'JKL' becomes 'KLM'.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm with the previous transformations.\n\nIn 'ABC', shifts are +1, +2, +3.\n\nIn 'DEF', shifts are +1, +3, +3.\n\nIn 'GHI', shifts are +1, +3, +3.\n\nSo for 'JKL', it should follow the same pattern: +1, +3, +3.\n\nThus, J\u2192K, K\u2192L, L\u2192M.\n\nTherefore, the result is 'KLM'.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the shifts are based on the previous transformation. Let's see:\n\nFrom ABC to BDF: +1, +2, +3.\n\nDEF to EHI: +1, +3, +3.\n\nGHI to HKL: +1, +3, +3.\n\nSo the second and third letters are shifting by +3 each time, regardless of the previous shift.\n\nThus, for 'JKL':\n\nJ +1 = K\n\nK +3 = L\n\nL +3 = M\n\nSo 'JKL' becomes 'KLM'.\n\nI think that's the pattern.\n</think>\n\nThe rule governing the transformations is that each letter in the string is shifted by a specific number of positions in the alphabet. The first letter is always shifted by +1, while each subsequent letter is shifted by +3. Applying this to 'JKL':\n\n- J (10) shifted by +1 becomes K (11)\n- K (11) shifted by +3 becomes L (14)\n- L (12) shifted by +3 becomes M (15)\n\nThus, the final transformation is 'KLM'.\n\n**Answer:** 'KLM'\n\nDONE."

Identify the rule that governs how one string transforms into another. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I've got this problem here with a sequence of transformations, and I need to figure out what the final transformation leads to. The sequence is:\n\n'ABC' \u2192 'BDF'\n'DEF' \u2192 'EHI'\n'GHI' \u2192 'HKL'\n'JKL' \u2192 '???'\n\nHmm, okay. Let's see. Each of these seems to be transforming one string into another. My goal is to figure out the rule that governs these transformations and then apply it to 'JKL' to find out what it becomes.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the first transformation: 'ABC' becomes 'BDF'. Let's break down the letters. In 'ABC', the letters are A, B, C. In 'BDF', they are B, D, F. So, how did we get from A, B, C to B, D, F?\n\nLet me see. Maybe each letter is being shifted by a certain number in the alphabet. Let's check:\n\nA to B: That's just +1.\nB to D: Hmm, that's +2.\nC to F: That's +3.\n\nWait, so A\u2192B (+1), B\u2192D (+2), C\u2192F (+3). So, each letter is being shifted by an incrementing number. That seems like a pattern. Let me test this with the second transformation to see if it holds.\n\nThe second transformation is 'DEF' \u2192 'EHI'. Let's break that down:\n\nD to E: +1\nE to H: +3\nF to I: +3\n\nWait, that doesn't fit the same pattern as before. In the first transformation, the shifts were +1, +2, +3. Here, it's +1, +3, +3. That doesn't seem consistent. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nLet me try another approach. Maybe it's not a simple shift. Perhaps each letter is being replaced by another letter, maybe based on some other rule.\n\nLooking again:\n\nABC \u2192 BDF\nDEF \u2192 EHI\nGHI \u2192 HKL\nJKL \u2192 ???\n\nI notice that each transformation seems to be taking the first letter and moving it somewhere else. For example, 'ABC' starts with A, and 'BDF' starts with B. Similarly, 'DEF' starts with D, and 'EHI' starts with E. 'GHI' starts with G, and 'HKL' starts with H. So, it seems like the first letter is being replaced by the second letter of the original string.\n\nSo, in 'ABC', the first letter A is replaced by B (the second letter). In 'DEF', D is replaced by E. In 'GHI', G is replaced by H. So that seems consistent.\n\nNow, what about the other letters? Let's look at the second letters. In 'ABC', the second letter is B, and in 'BDF', the second letter is D. So, B becomes D. Similarly, in 'DEF', the second letter is E, and in 'EHI', the second letter is H. So E becomes H.\n\nWait, B\u2192D and E\u2192H. Let's see what's happening here. B to D is +2, E to H is +4. Hmm, not sure about that.\n\nLooking at the third letters: In 'ABC', C becomes F. So C\u2192F. In 'DEF', F becomes I. So F\u2192I. And in 'GHI', I becomes K. So I\u2192K.\n\nSo, C\u2192F, F\u2192I, I\u2192K. That seems like a cycle: C\u2192F\u2192I\u2192K, and so on. Each time, it's moving two places forward in the alphabet? Let's check:\n\nC is the 3rd letter, F is the 6th. 3 + 3 = 6. F to I is 6 + 3 = 9 (I is the 9th letter). I to K is 9 + 2 = 11 (K is the 11th). Wait, that's inconsistent. From F to I is +3, but from I to K is +2. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's moving two places each time. C to F is +3, F to I is +3, I to K is +2. That doesn't fit. Maybe it's not a consistent shift.\n\nWait, perhaps it's related to the previous transformation. Let's see.\n\nLooking at the first transformation again:\n\nABC \u2192 BDF\nA\u2192B, B\u2192D, C\u2192F\n\nSo, A is replaced by B, which is the second letter of the original string. B is replaced by D, which is the third letter of the original string. C is replaced by F, which is the fourth letter.\n\nWait, that might be the case. Let me test that.\n\nIn 'ABC', the second letter is B, and it's replaced by D, which is the third letter. The third letter is C, replaced by F, which is the fourth letter.\n\nSimilarly, in 'DEF', the second letter is E, replaced by H, which is the third letter. The third letter is F, replaced by I, which is the fourth letter.\n\nIn 'GHI', the second letter is H, replaced by K, which is the third letter. The third letter is I, replaced by L, which is the fourth letter.\n\nWait, that seems consistent. So the rule might be that each letter is replaced by the next letter in the string. Let me clarify:\n\nIn 'ABC', A is replaced by B (the next letter), B is replaced by D (the letter after B in the alphabet?), but that doesn't fit. Wait, no, in 'ABC', B is replaced by D, which is two letters ahead. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each letter is being shifted by the position of the letter in the string. Let me think.\n\nIn 'ABC', A is the first letter, so maybe shifted by 1. B is the second, shifted by 2. C is the third, shifted by 3.\n\nSo, A shifted by 1 becomes B. B shifted by 2 becomes D. C shifted by 3 becomes F. That fits.\n\nSimilarly, in 'DEF', D shifted by 1 is E. E shifted by 2 is G. F shifted by 3 is I. But wait, the result is 'EHI', so E shifted by 1 is F, but in the result, it's E\u2192H. That doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe it's not shifting the letters themselves but mapping them to other letters.\n\nLooking again:\n\nABC \u2192 BDF\n\nSo, A\u2192B, B\u2192D, C\u2192F\n\nSimilarly, DEF \u2192 EHI\n\nD\u2192E, E\u2192H, F\u2192I\n\nGHI \u2192 HKL\n\nG\u2192H, H\u2192K, I\u2192L\n\nSo, looking at these mappings:\n\nA\u2192B, B\u2192D, C\u2192F\n\nD\u2192E, E\u2192H, F\u2192I\n\nG\u2192H, H\u2192K, I\u2192L\n\nWait, maybe it's a cyclic permutation where each letter is mapped to the next one in a certain sequence.\n\nLooking at A\u2192B, B\u2192D, D\u2192E, E\u2192H, H\u2192K, K\u2192L...\n\nWait, that seems a bit random. Alternatively, perhaps it's based on the position in the string.\n\nIn 'ABC', each letter is replaced by the next letter in the alphabet. A\u2192B, B\u2192C, but here it's B\u2192D, which is +2. Hmm, not matching.\n\nWait, let's look at the second transformation: DEF \u2192 EHI\n\nD\u2192E, E\u2192H, F\u2192I\n\nSo, D is the first letter, becomes E. E is the second letter, becomes H. F is the third letter, becomes I.\n\nSimilarly, in the first transformation: ABC \u2192 BDF\n\nA becomes B, B becomes D, C becomes F.\n\nSo, perhaps the first letter is being replaced by the second letter, the second by the third, and the third by the fourth letter of the alphabet.\n\nWait, but in the first transformation, A (1st) \u2192 B (2nd). B (2nd) \u2192 D (4th). C (3rd) \u2192 F (6th). Hmm, that seems like each letter is being replaced by a letter that's three positions ahead in the alphabet.\n\nA (1) +3 = D, but A\u2192B, so that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe each letter is being replaced by the letter three places ahead in the string.\n\nWait, in 'ABC', A is replaced by B (next letter), B is replaced by D (third letter), C is replaced by F (fourth letter). So, first letter becomes second, second becomes third, third becomes fourth. So it's like shifting each letter's position by one.\n\nSimilarly, in 'DEF', D becomes E (second letter), E becomes F (third), F becomes I (fourth). Wait, but in the result, it's 'EHI', so E\u2192H, F\u2192I. Hmm, not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps it's a rotation within the string. For example, in 'ABC', moving the last letter to the front. But 'ABC' \u2192 'BDF' doesn't fit that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a Caesar cipher with a shift. Let's see.\n\nIf we take each letter and shift it by a certain number. For 'ABC'\u2192'BDF':\n\nA\u2192B: +1\n\nB\u2192D: +2\n\nC\u2192F: +3\n\nSo, each letter is shifted by an incrementing number: +1, +2, +3.\n\nBut let's check the second transformation: 'DEF'\u2192'EHI'\n\nD\u2192E: +1\n\nE\u2192H: +4\n\nF\u2192I: +1\n\nWait, that doesn't fit. It's inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's based on the position in the string. So, first letter is shifted by 1, second by 2, third by 3.\n\nIn 'ABC', A (1st) +1 = B, B (2nd) +2 = D, C (3rd) +3 = F. That fits.\n\nIn 'DEF', D (1st) +1 = E, E (2nd) +2 = G, F (3rd) +3 = I. But the result is 'EHI', so E\u2192H, which is +4, and F\u2192I, which is +1. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe it's not a shift but a substitution cipher. Let's see.\n\nLooking at the letters being replaced:\n\nABC \u2192 BDF\n\nSo, A\u2192B, B\u2192D, C\u2192F\n\nDEF \u2192 EHI\n\nD\u2192E, E\u2192H, F\u2192I\n\nGHI \u2192 HKL\n\nG\u2192H, H\u2192K, I\u2192L\n\nSo, perhaps each letter is being replaced by the next letter in a sequence: A\u2192B, B\u2192C, but here B\u2192D, so maybe it's a different sequence.\n\nWait, let's list the mappings:\n\nA\u2192B\n\nB\u2192D\n\nC\u2192F\n\nD\u2192E\n\nE\u2192H\n\nF\u2192I\n\nG\u2192H\n\nH\u2192K\n\nI\u2192L\n\nWait, that seems like a substitution cipher where each letter is mapped to another. Let's see if there's a pattern.\n\nLooking at A\u2192B, B\u2192D, C\u2192F, D\u2192E, E\u2192H, F\u2192I, G\u2192H, H\u2192K, I\u2192L.\n\nHmm, it's a bit confusing. Maybe it's based on the position in the alphabet. Let's see:\n\nA is 1, B is 2, C is 3, D is 4, E is 5, F is 6, G is 7, H is 8, I is 9, J is 10, K is 11, L is 12.\n\nSo, mapping:\n\n1\u21922 (+1)\n\n2\u21924 (+2)\n\n3\u21926 (+3)\n\n4\u21925 (-1)\n\n5\u21928 (+3)\n\n6\u21929 (+3)\n\n7\u21928 (-1)\n\n8\u219211 (+3)\n\n9\u219212 (+3)\n\nHmm, that seems inconsistent. Maybe it's a different rule.\n\nWait, perhaps it's based on the number of letters in the word. 'ABC' has 3 letters, 'BDF' also has 3. 'DEF' has 3, 'EHI' has 3. 'GHI' has 3, 'HKL' has 3. So, the length remains the same.\n\nMaybe it's a rotation within the string. For example, in 'ABC', moving each letter one position forward. But A\u2192B, B\u2192C, C\u2192A. But in the result, it's B\u2192D, so that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's based on the previous transformation. Let's see:\n\nABC \u2192 BDF\n\nDEF \u2192 EHI\n\nGHI \u2192 HKL\n\nJKL \u2192 ???\n\nLooking at the first letters: A\u2192B, D\u2192E, G\u2192H. So, A, D, G are being replaced by B, E, H respectively.\n\nWait, A\u2192B, D\u2192E, G\u2192H. So, the first letters are being replaced by the next letter in the alphabet: A\u2192B, D\u2192E, G\u2192H.\n\nSimilarly, in the second letters: B\u2192D, E\u2192H, H\u2192K.\n\nWait, B\u2192D, which is +2. E\u2192H, which is +4. H\u2192K, which is +2.\n\nThird letters: C\u2192F, F\u2192I, I\u2192L.\n\nC\u2192F is +3, F\u2192I is +3, I\u2192L is +3.\n\nHmm, so the third letters are each being shifted by +3.\n\nBut the first letters are being shifted by +1, +1, +1? Wait, A\u2192B is +1, D\u2192E is +1, G\u2192H is +1. So, first letters are shifted by +1.\n\nSecond letters: B\u2192D (+2), E\u2192H (+4), H\u2192K (+2). So, not consistent.\n\nThird letters: C\u2192F (+3), F\u2192I (+3), I\u2192L (+3). So, consistent +3.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe the rule is different for each position.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's based on the position in the transformation sequence.\n\nLooking at the transformations:\n\n1. ABC \u2192 BDF\n\n2. DEF \u2192 EHI\n\n3. GHI \u2192 HKL\n\n4. JKL \u2192 ???\n\nEach transformation seems to be taking the previous string's last letter and appending it to the next string.\n\nWait, ABC ends with C, but BDF starts with B. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's based on the previous string's first letter becoming the next string's first letter.\n\nABC starts with A, BDF starts with B.\n\nDEF starts with D, EHI starts with E.\n\nGHI starts with G, HKL starts with H.\n\nSo, the first letters are A\u2192B, D\u2192E, G\u2192H. So, each first letter is being replaced by the next letter in the alphabet.\n\nSimilarly, in the second letters: B\u2192D, E\u2192H, H\u2192K.\n\nSo, B\u2192D (+2), E\u2192H (+4), H\u2192K (+2).\n\nWait, that's inconsistent. Maybe it's based on the number of transformations so far.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each transformation is shifting the letters by an increasing number.\n\nFirst transformation: +1, +2, +3.\n\nSecond transformation: +1, +3, +3.\n\nThird transformation: +1, +1, +3.\n\nNot sure.\n\nWait, let's look at the third transformation: GHI \u2192 HKL\n\nG\u2192H (+1), H\u2192K (+2), I\u2192L (+2).\n\nSo, first letter +1, second and third +2.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's based on the position in the string.\n\nFirst letter: shifted by 1.\n\nSecond letter: shifted by 2.\n\nThird letter: shifted by 3.\n\nBut in the first transformation, that works: A+1=B, B+2=D, C+3=F.\n\nIn the second transformation, D+1=E, E+2=G, F+3=I. But the result is EHI, so E\u2192H, which is +4, not +2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe it's a different shift for each transformation.\n\nFirst transformation: +1, +2, +3.\n\nSecond transformation: +1, +4, +1.\n\nThird transformation: +1, +1, +3.\n\nHmm, not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's based on the previous transformation's shift.\n\nFirst transformation: +1, +2, +3.\n\nSecond transformation: +1, +3, +3.\n\nThird transformation: +1, +1, +3.\n\nNot sure.\n\nWait, maybe it's based on the letters themselves. Let's see:\n\nIn 'ABC', A\u2192B, B\u2192D, C\u2192F.\n\nSo, A is replaced by B, which is the next letter.\n\nB is replaced by D, which is two letters ahead.\n\nC is replaced by F, which is three letters ahead.\n\nSimilarly, in 'DEF', D\u2192E, E\u2192H, F\u2192I.\n\nD\u2192E is +1, E\u2192H is +4, F\u2192I is +1.\n\nWait, that seems inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a rotation within the alphabet. For example, A\u2192B, B\u2192C, but here B\u2192D, so maybe it's a different rotation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's based on the position in the transformation sequence.\n\nFirst transformation: shift each letter by 1, 2, 3.\n\nSecond transformation: shift each letter by 1, 3, 3.\n\nThird transformation: shift each letter by 1, 1, 3.\n\nNot consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's based on the letters' numerical values.\n\nA=1, B=2, C=3, D=4, E=5, F=6, G=7, H=8, I=9, J=10, K=11, L=12.\n\nSo, in 'ABC', 1\u21922, 2\u21924, 3\u21926.\n\nSo, 1+1=2, 2+2=4, 3+3=6.\n\nSimilarly, in 'DEF', 4\u21925, 5\u21928, 6\u21929.\n\nWait, 4+1=5, 5+3=8, 6+3=9.\n\nThird transformation: 'GHI' \u2192 'HKL'\n\n7\u21928, 8\u219211, 9\u219212.\n\nSo, 7+1=8, 8+3=11, 9+3=12.\n\nSo, the pattern seems to be that in each transformation, the first letter is shifted by +1, the second letter is shifted by +2 in the first transformation, but +3 in the second and third. Wait, no.\n\nWait, in the first transformation, the shifts are +1, +2, +3.\n\nSecond transformation: +1, +3,"

If I think about the alphabet positions:\n\n- A is the 1st letter\n- B is the 2nd\n- C is the 3rd\n- D is the 4th\n- F is the 6th\n\nSo, A (1) \u2192 B (2) \u2192 D (4). Wait, that's not a straightforward shift. Similarly, C (3) \u2192 F (6). That's a jump of 2 letters each time. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nLet me look at the second transformation: 'DEF' becomes 'EHI'. So:\n\n- D \u2192 E\n- E \u2192 H\n- F \u2192 I\n\nAgain, each letter is being replaced by another. Let's map them:\n\n- D \u2192 E\n- E \u2192 H\n- F \u2192 I\n\nLooking at positions:\n\n- D is 4\n- E is 5\n- F is 6\n- H is 8\n- I is 9\n\nSo, D (4) \u2192 E (5): that's a shift of +1.\nE (5) \u2192 H (8): that's a shift of +3.\nF (6) \u2192 I (9): that's a shift of +3.\n\nWait, that's inconsistent. First, +1, then +3, then +3. Maybe there's a different pattern.\n\nLet me check the third transformation: 'GHI' \u2192 'HKL'.\n\n- G \u2192 H\n- H \u2192 K\n- I \u2192 L\n\nMapping:\n\n- G \u2192 H\n- H \u2192 K\n- I \u2192 L\n\nPositions:\n\n- G is 7\n- H is 8\n- I is 9\n- K is 11\n- L is 12\n\nSo, G (7) \u2192 H (8): +1\nH (8) \u2192 K (11): +3\nI (9) \u2192 L (12): +3\n\nSame pattern as before: +1, then +3, then +3.\n\nWait, that's the same as the second transformation. Maybe the first one is an exception or maybe I'm missing something.\n\nLet me see the first transformation again: 'ABC' \u2192 'BDF'\n\nA \u2192 B: +1\nB \u2192 D: +2\nC \u2192 F: +3\n\nSo, +1, +2, +3.\n\nHmm, that's a different pattern. So, the first transformation has each letter shifted by 1, 2, 3 respectively.\n\nThe second transformation has shifts of +1, +3, +3.\n\nThe third transformation also has shifts of +1, +3, +3.\n\nWait, maybe the first transformation is a different case or maybe it's a typo. But let's assume it's intentional.\n\nSo, perhaps the rule is that each letter is shifted forward in the alphabet by a certain number, but the number varies depending on the transformation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a rotation within a group of letters or something else.\n\nLet me try to see if there's another pattern. Maybe each transformation is based on a different rule.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a cyclic permutation or a substitution cipher where each letter is replaced by another following a specific rule.\n\nWait, let's see the letters in each transformation:\n\nFirst: A, B, C \u2192 B, D, F\n\nSecond: D, E, F \u2192 E, H, I\n\nThird: G, H, I \u2192 H, K, L\n\nFourth: J, K, L \u2192 ?\n\nHmm, maybe the rule is that each transformation takes the first letter and moves it forward by a certain number, and the rest follow.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's based on the position in the word.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nFirst transformation:\n\nA B C \u2192 B D F\n\nSo, A (1) becomes B (2): +1\nB (2) becomes D (4): +2\nC (3) becomes F (6): +3\n\nSo, each letter is shifted by 1, 2, 3 respectively.\n\nSecond transformation:\n\nD (4) \u2192 E (5): +1\nE (5) \u2192 H (8): +3\nF (6) \u2192 I (9): +3\n\nThird transformation:\n\nG (7) \u2192 H (8): +1\nH (8) \u2192 K (11): +3\nI (9) \u2192 L (12): +3\n\nSo, the first letter is shifted by +1, and the other two are shifted by +3 each.\n\nWait, that seems consistent across the second and third transformations.\n\nFirst transformation is different, with each letter shifted by 1, 2, 3.\n\nMaybe the first transformation is a special case, and the subsequent ones follow a different rule.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shifts are based on the position in the word.\n\nWait, in the first transformation, 'ABC' has three letters. The shifts are 1, 2, 3.\n\nIn the second transformation, 'DEF' also has three letters, but the shifts are +1, +3, +3.\n\nThird transformation, 'GHI' \u2192 'HKL': shifts +1, +3, +3.\n\nSo, the first transformation is different, but the others have the first letter shifted by +1, and the next two letters shifted by +3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the shift is based on the number of letters in the word.\n\nWait, 'ABC' has 3 letters, and the shifts are 1, 2, 3.\n\n'DEF' has 3 letters, shifts are 1, 3, 3.\n\n'GHI' has 3 letters, shifts are 1, 3, 3.\n\nSo, maybe in the first transformation, the shifts are sequential, but in the others, it's +1 for the first letter and +3 for the rest.\n\nBut that seems inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the shifts are based on the position in the word.\n\nIn 'ABC':\n\nA (1) \u2192 B (2): +1\nB (2) \u2192 D (4): +2\nC (3) \u2192 F (6): +3\n\nSo, each letter is shifted by its position number.\n\nIn 'DEF':\n\nD (4) \u2192 E (5): +1\nE (5) \u2192 H (8): +3\nF (6) \u2192 I (9): +3\n\nWait, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a different rule.\n\nWait, let's think differently.\n\nLooking at the first transformation:\n\nA B C \u2192 B D F\n\nSo, A\u2192B, B\u2192D, C\u2192F.\n\nLooking at the second transformation:\n\nD E F \u2192 E H I\n\nD\u2192E, E\u2192H, F\u2192I.\n\nThird transformation:\n\nG H I \u2192 H K L\n\nG\u2192H, H\u2192K, I\u2192L.\n\nFourth transformation: J K L \u2192 ?\n\nLooking for a pattern, perhaps each letter is replaced by the next letter in the alphabet, but with some skips.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a Caesar cipher with varying shifts.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nA\u2192B: +1\nB\u2192D: +2\nC\u2192F: +3\n\nD\u2192E: +1\nE\u2192H: +3\nF\u2192I: +3\n\nG\u2192H: +1\nH\u2192K: +3\nI\u2192L: +3\n\nSo, the first letter is shifted by +1, and the other letters are shifted by +3.\n\nWait, that seems consistent.\n\nIn the first transformation, 'ABC':\n\nA\u2192B: +1\nB\u2192D: +2\nC\u2192F: +3\n\nWait, that doesn't fit. Because in the first transformation, the shifts are +1, +2, +3.\n\nBut in the subsequent transformations, it's +1, +3, +3.\n\nSo, maybe the first transformation is a special case, or perhaps the rule changes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shift amount increases by 1 each time.\n\nBut that doesn't fit either.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nFirst transformation: shifts are 1,2,3.\n\nSecond transformation: shifts are 1,3,3.\n\nThird transformation: shifts are 1,3,3.\n\nSo, maybe the first transformation is a different rule, and the rest follow shifts of +1, +3, +3.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shifts are based on the number of letters in the word.\n\nBut all transformations are 3-letter words.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a different rule.\n\nWait, perhaps it's based on the position in the word.\n\nIn 'ABC':\n\nA is the first letter, so shift by 1.\n\nB is the second letter, so shift by 2.\n\nC is the third letter, shift by 3.\n\nSo, A(1)+1=B(2)\n\nB(2)+2=D(4)\n\nC(3)+3=F(6)\n\nIn 'DEF':\n\nD(4)+1=E(5)\n\nE(5)+3=H(8)\n\nF(6)+3=I(9)\n\nIn 'GHI':\n\nG(7)+1=H(8)\n\nH(8)+3=K(11)\n\nI(9)+3=L(12)\n\nSo, the pattern seems to be:\n\n- For the first letter, shift by +1.\n\n- For the second and third letters, shift by +3.\n\nThat seems consistent.\n\nSo, the rule is:\n\nEach letter in the word is shifted forward in the alphabet by a certain number:\n\n- The first letter is shifted by +1.\n\n- The second and third letters are shifted by +3.\n\nSo, applying this rule to 'JKL' \u2192 ?\n\nLet's see:\n\nJ is the first letter, so shift by +1: J(10)+1=K(11)\n\nK is the second letter, shift by +3: K(11)+3=M(14)\n\nL is the third letter, shift by +3: L(12)+3=N(15)\n\nSo, 'JKL' becomes 'KMN'.\n\nTherefore, the result is 'KMN'.\n\nSo, the final transformation is 'JKL' \u2192 'KMN'.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe rule is that each letter in the word is shifted forward in the alphabet by a certain number:\n\n- The first letter is shifted by +1.\n\n- The second and third letters are shifted by +3.\n\nApplying this to 'JKL':\n\n- J (10) +1 = K (11)\n\n- K (11) +3 = M (14)\n\n- L (12) +3 = N (15)\n\nSo, 'JKL' becomes 'KMN'.\n\nDONE."

End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: Consider the following sequence of transformations:\n\n'ABC' \u2192 'BDF'\n'DEF' \u2192 'EHI'\n'GHI' \u2192 'HKL'\n'JKL' \u2192 '???'\n\nWhat is the result of the final transformation? Identify the rule that governs how one string transforms into another. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I've got this problem here with a sequence of transformations, and I need to figure out what the final transformation results in. Let me try to break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, let me write down what's given:\n\n1. 'ABC' transforms to 'BDF'\n2. 'DEF' transforms to 'EHI'\n3. 'GHI' transforms to 'HKL'\n4. Then, 'JKL' transforms to '???'\n\nI need to find out what 'JKL' turns into and figure out the rule that governs these transformations.\n\nOkay, starting with the first transformation: 'ABC' becomes 'BDF'. Hmm, let me look at each letter and see how it changes.\n\n- A becomes B\n- B becomes D\n- C becomes F\n\nWait, that seems a bit odd. So, A to B is just one letter up in the alphabet. But B to D is three letters ahead, and C to F is four letters ahead. That doesn't seem consistent. Maybe it's not a simple shift.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about the positions of the letters in the alphabet. Let's see:\n\n- A is the 1st letter, B is the 2nd, C is the 3rd.\n- B becomes D, which is the 4th letter.\n- C becomes F, which is the 6th letter.\n\nSo, from A (1) to B (2), that's +1. From B (2) to D (4), that's +2. From C (3) to F (6), that's +3. Oh, interesting! It looks like each letter is being shifted by an incrementing number: +1, +2, +3.\n\nLet me check the next transformation to see if this pattern holds.\n\nSecond transformation: 'DEF' becomes 'EHI'.\n\n- D becomes E\n- E becomes H\n- F becomes I\n\nAgain, let's look at the positions:\n\n- D is 4, E is 5: +1\n- E is 5, H is 8: +3\n- F is 6, I is 9: +3\n\nWait, that doesn't fit the previous pattern. It was +1, +2, +3 before, but here it's +1, +3, +3. That seems inconsistent. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nLet me try another approach. Perhaps it's related to the number of letters between them or some other pattern.\n\nWait, another thought: maybe it's about the letters themselves, not their positions. Let me think about the letters and see if there's a different kind of shift.\n\nLooking at 'ABC' to 'BDF':\n\n- A to B: A is the first letter, B is the second, so maybe it's moving forward by one.\n- B to D: B is the second letter, D is the fourth, so moving forward by two.\n- C to F: C is the third letter, F is the sixth, moving forward by three.\n\nSo that seems to fit: each letter is moving forward by an incrementing number of places. So, +1, +2, +3.\n\nLet me test this with the next transformation.\n\n'DEF' to 'EHI':\n\n- D to E: D is 4, E is 5, so +1.\n- E to H: E is 5, H is 8, so +3.\n- F to I: F is 6, I is 9, so +3.\n\nWait, that's not matching the previous pattern. If it was +1, +2, +3, then from E to H should be +2, not +3. So maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shift is based on the position in the transformation sequence. Let me see.\n\nFirst transformation: 'ABC' to 'BDF' with shifts +1, +2, +3.\n\nSecond transformation: 'DEF' to 'EHI' with shifts +1, +3, +3.\n\nHmm, that doesn't seem consistent. Maybe the shift numbers are different based on something else.\n\nLet me try another angle. Maybe it's about the letters themselves, like moving a certain number of letters forward in the alphabet, but not necessarily the same each time.\n\nWait, another idea: perhaps it's based on the letters' positions in the word. For example, in 'ABC', A is the first letter, B the second, C the third. So maybe the shift is based on their position in the word.\n\nSo, in 'ABC':\n\n- A (position 1) shifts +1 to B\n- B (position 2) shifts +2 to D\n- C (position 3) shifts +3 to F\n\nThat seems to fit. Let's check the next transformation.\n\n'DEF' becomes 'EHI':\n\n- D is position 1: shifts +1 to E\n- E is position 2: shifts +2 to G\n- F is position 3: shifts +3 to I\n\nWait, but the result is 'EHI', not 'EFG'. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the shift is based on the position in the overall sequence of transformations.\n\nWait, maybe it's about the number of letters in the previous word. 'ABC' has 3 letters, 'DEF' has 3 letters, 'GHI' has 3 letters, and 'JKL' has 3 letters. So maybe the shift is based on the position within the triplet.\n\nWait, another thought: maybe it's about the letters themselves, but in a different way. For example, A to B is +1, B to D is +2, C to F is +3. So each letter is being shifted by its position in the word.\n\nIn 'ABC':\n\n- A (1st letter) shifts +1\n- B (2nd letter) shifts +2\n- C (3rd letter) shifts +3\n\nSo, A(1)+1=B, B(2)+2=D, C(3)+3=F.\n\nSimilarly, 'DEF' to 'EHI':\n\n- D(1)+1=E\n- E(2)+2=G\n- F(3)+3=I\n\nBut the result is 'EHI', not 'EFG'. So that doesn't align.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me look at the letters themselves.\n\nFrom 'ABC' to 'BDF':\n\n- A \u2192 B\n- B \u2192 D\n- C \u2192 F\n\nLooking at the letters, A to B is one letter forward, B to D is two letters forward, C to F is three letters forward. So, the shift increments by one each time.\n\nSimilarly, 'DEF' to 'EHI':\n\n- D \u2192 E (one forward)\n- E \u2192 H (three forward)\n- F \u2192 I (three forward)\n\nWait, that's inconsistent. It should be +1, +2, +3, but here it's +1, +3, +3. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's based on the letters' positions in the word, but with a different rule.\n\nWait, another idea: maybe it's the difference between the letters. Let's see:\n\nIn 'ABC' to 'BDF':\n\n- A(1) to B(2): difference +1\n- B(2) to D(4): difference +2\n- C(3) to F(6): difference +3\n\nSo that's +1, +2, +3.\n\nIn 'DEF' to 'EHI':\n\n- D(4) to E(5): +1\n- E(5) to H(8): +3\n- F(6) to I(9): +3\n\nHmm, that's not matching the previous pattern. So maybe the shift isn't consistent across all transformations.\n\nWait, perhaps the shift is based on the position of the word in the sequence. Let me see.\n\nFirst transformation: 'ABC' \u2192 'BDF' with shifts +1, +2, +3.\n\nSecond transformation: 'DEF' \u2192 'EHI' with shifts +1, +3, +3.\n\nThird transformation: 'GHI' \u2192 'HKL'.\n\nLet me see what that shift would be.\n\nG(7) \u2192 H(8): +1\n\nH(8) \u2192 K(11): +3\n\nI(9) \u2192 L(12): +3\n\nSo again, +1, +3, +3. That seems inconsistent with the first transformation.\n\nWait, maybe the shift is based on the number of letters in the previous word. 'ABC' has 3 letters, so shifts are +1, +2, +3.\n\n'DEF' also has 3 letters, so shifts should be +1, +2, +3.\n\nBut in the second transformation, 'DEF' \u2192 'EHI':\n\n- D(4) +1 = E(5)\n- E(5) +3 = H(8)\n- F(6) +3 = I(9)\n\nSo that's +1, +3, +3.\n\nHmm, that doesn't fit the +1, +2, +3 pattern.\n\nWait, maybe the shift increments by one each time, but starting from the previous transformation's shift.\n\nWait, in the first transformation, shifts are +1, +2, +3.\n\nIn the second transformation, maybe shifts are +1, +2, +3 again, but the result is 'EHI'.\n\nWait, let's try that.\n\n'DEF' \u2192 'EHI':\n\n- D(4) +1 = E(5)\n- E(5) +2 = F(7)\n- F(6) +3 = I(9)\n\nBut that would result in 'EFGI', which isn't the case. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the shift is based on the letters themselves, but in a different way.\n\nWait, another approach: maybe it's about moving the letters forward by a certain number of places based on their position in the word.\n\nIn 'ABC':\n\n- A (1st letter) shifts +1 to B\n- B (2nd letter) shifts +2 to D\n- C (3rd letter) shifts +3 to F\n\nSo that's +1, +2, +3.\n\nIn 'DEF':\n\n- D (1st letter) shifts +1 to E\n- E (2nd letter) shifts +2 to G\n- F (3rd letter) shifts +3 to I\n\nSo the result should be 'EFGI', but the given result is 'EHI'. That doesn't match.\n\nWait, maybe the shift is different. Let's see:\n\n'DEF' \u2192 'EHI':\n\n- D(4) \u2192 E(5): +1\n- E(5) \u2192 H(8): +3\n- F(6) \u2192 I(9): +3\n\nSo that's +1, +3, +3.\n\nHmm, so the first shift is +1, then the next two are +3 each.\n\nSimilarly, 'GHI' \u2192 'HKL':\n\n- G(7) \u2192 H(8): +1\n- H(8) \u2192 K(11): +3\n- I(9) \u2192 L(12): +3\n\nAgain, +1, +3, +3.\n\nSo perhaps the first letter is shifted by +1, and the next two letters are shifted by +3 each.\n\nIf that's the case, then 'JKL' would transform as:\n\n- J(10) +1 = K(11)\n- K(11) +3 = M(14)\n- L(12) +3 = O(15)\n\nSo 'JKL' would become 'KMO'.\n\nWait, but let me check if this pattern holds.\n\nFirst transformation: 'ABC' \u2192 'BDF'\n\n- A(1)+1=B(2)\n- B(2)+3=D(5)\n- C(3)+3=F(6)\n\nBut that doesn't match 'BDF' because 'BDF' is B(2), D(4), F(6). So according to this, the second letter shift would be +3, but in 'ABC' \u2192 'BDF', B(2)+2=D(4). So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the first transformation is an exception. Or perhaps the rule changes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the shift is based on the position in the sequence of transformations.\n\nFirst transformation: 'ABC' \u2192 'BDF' with shifts +1, +2, +3.\n\nSecond transformation: 'DEF' \u2192 'EHI' with shifts +1, +3, +3.\n\nThird transformation: 'GHI' \u2192 'HKL' with shifts +1, +3, +3.\n\nSo, starting from the second transformation, the shifts are +1, +3, +3.\n\nIf that's the case, then 'JKL' would shift as:\n\n- J(10) +1 = K(11)\n- K(11) +3 = M(14)\n- L(12) +3 = O(15)\n\nSo 'JKL' \u2192 'KMO'.\n\nBut let me check if this makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the shift is based on the number of letters in the word. Since all words have 3 letters, perhaps the shift is +1, +2, +3 for the first transformation, and +1, +3, +3 for the subsequent ones. That seems inconsistent, but perhaps that's the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the shift is based on the letters themselves, like moving forward by the number of letters in the previous word.\n\nWait, another thought: maybe it's about the letters' positions in the alphabet modulo something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a rotation within the letters. For example, A\u2192B, B\u2192C, etc., but that doesn't fit because B\u2192D is skipping C.\n\nWait, perhaps it's about the letters being replaced by the next letter in a certain way, but with an incrementing shift.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Maybe each letter is being shifted forward by the number of letters in the previous transformation.\n\nWait, that might not make sense. Alternatively, maybe it's about the letters being shifted forward by the number corresponding to their position in the word.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to see if there's a pattern in the transformations.\n\nLooking at the first transformation:\n\nA B C \u2192 B D F\n\nSo, each letter is being shifted by an incrementing number: +1, +2, +3.\n\nSecond transformation:\n\nD E F \u2192 E H I\n\nSo, D\u2192E: +1\n\nE\u2192H: +3\n\nF\u2192I: +3\n\nThird transformation:\n\nG H I \u2192 H K L\n\nG\u2192H: +1\n\nH\u2192K: +3\n\nI\u2192L: +3\n\nSo, from the second transformation onwards, it's +1, +3, +3.\n\nIf that's the case, then 'JKL' would be:\n\nJ\u2192K: +1\n\nK\u2192M: +3\n\nL\u2192O: +3\n\nSo, 'JKL' \u2192 'KMO'.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the shifts are based on the position in the transformation sequence.\n\nFirst transformation: shifts +1, +2, +3.\n\nSecond transformation: shifts +1, +3, +3.\n\nThird transformation: shifts +1, +3, +3.\n\nSo, starting from the second transformation, the shifts are +1, +3, +3.\n\nTherefore, 'JKL' would shift as:\n\nJ(10) +1 = K(11)\n\nK(11) +3 = M(14)\n\nL(12) +3 = O(15)\n\nSo, 'KMO'.\n\nWait, but let me check if this is consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the shift is based on the letters themselves, like moving forward by a certain number of letters each time.\n\nWait, another approach: let's see if the transformations can be represented as a function.\n\nFrom 'ABC' to 'BDF':\n\nA(1) \u2192 B(2): +1\n\nB(2) \u2192 D(4): +2\n\nC(3) \u2192 F(6): +3\n\nSo, each letter is shifted by its position in the word: 1, 2, 3.\n\nSimilarly, 'DEF' to 'EHI':\n\nD(4) \u2192 E(5): +1\n\nE(5) \u2192 H(8): +3\n\nF(6) \u2192 I(9): +3\n\nWait, that's inconsistent.

    "solution": "Solve this problem step by step. End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: Consider the following sequence of transformations:\n\n'ABC' \u2192 'BDF'\n'DEF' \u2192 'EHI'\n'GHI' \u2192 'HKL'\n'JKL' \u2192 '???'\n\nWhat is the result of the final transformation? Identify the rule that governs how one string transforms into another. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I have this sequence of transformations here, and I need to figure out what the final transformation results in. The transformations are:\n\n1. 'ABC' \u2192 'BDF'\n2. 'DEF' \u2192 'EHI'\n3. 'GHI' \u2192 'HKL'\n4. 'JKL' \u2192 '???'\n\nHmm, I need to figure out the rule that transforms one string into another. Let me start by looking at each transformation one by one and see if I can spot a pattern.\n\nFirst, 'ABC' becomes 'BDF'. Let's break down the letters:\n\n- A becomes B\n- B becomes D\n- C becomes F\n\nWait, that's interesting. Each letter is being shifted by a certain number of places in the alphabet. Let's check the exact shift:\n\n- A (1) \u2192 B (2): shift of +1\n- B (2) \u2192 D (4): shift of +2\n- C (3) \u2192 F (6): shift of +3\n\nSo, each letter is being shifted forward by its position in the string. The first letter is shifted by 1, the second by 2, and the third by 3. That seems consistent for the first transformation.\n\nLet me test this with the second transformation: 'DEF' \u2192 'EHI'.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- D (4) \u2192 E (5): shift of +1\n- E (5) \u2192 H (8): shift of +3\n- F (6) \u2192 I (9): shift of +3\n\nWait a minute, that doesn't fit the previous pattern. The first letter was shifted by +1, but the second and third letters were shifted by +3 each. That doesn't seem consistent. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nLet me check the positions again. In 'DEF', D is the first letter, E the second, F the third. If I apply the same shifting based on their position in the string:\n\n- D (4) shifted by +1 \u2192 E (5)\n- E (5) shifted by +2 \u2192 F (6)\n- F (6) shifted by +3 \u2192 I (9)\n\nBut the result is 'EHI', not 'EFG' or something else. So, that doesn't align. Maybe the shifting isn't based on their position in the string, but rather their position in the alphabet.\n\nLet's try that. For 'DEF' \u2192 'EHI':\n\n- D (4) \u2192 E (5): shift of +1\n- E (5) \u2192 H (8): shift of +3\n- F (6) \u2192 I (9): shift of +3\n\nStill, the first shift is +1, and the others are +3. That's inconsistent. Maybe there's another rule.\n\nLet's look at the third transformation: 'GHI' \u2192 'HKL'.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- G (7) \u2192 H (8): shift of +1\n- H (8) \u2192 K (11): shift of +3\n- I (9) \u2192 L (12): shift of +3\n\nAgain, the first letter is shifted by +1, and the rest by +3. This seems to be a pattern now.\n\nSo, the rule might be that each letter is shifted forward in the alphabet by an amount equal to its position in the string. The first letter is shifted by 1, the second by 2, the third by 3, and so on.\n\nLet me test this with the first transformation again:\n\n- A (1) +1 = B (2)\n- B (2) +2 = D (4)\n- C (3) +3 = F (6)\n\nYes, that works.\n\nNow, the second transformation:\n\n- D (4) +1 = E (5)\n- E (5) +2 = F (6)\n- F (6) +3 = I (9)\n\nBut the result is 'EHI', not 'EFG'. Wait, that doesn't match. So, there's a discrepancy here.\n\nMaybe I'm misunderstanding the rule. Let me think differently. Perhaps it's not the position in the string, but the position in the alphabet.\n\nLet's try that. For 'ABC' \u2192 'BDF':\n\n- A (1) \u2192 B (2): shift +1\n- B (2) \u2192 D (4): shift +2\n- C (3) \u2192 F (6): shift +3\n\nThat works.\n\nNow, 'DEF' \u2192 'EHI':\n\n- D (4) \u2192 E (5): shift +1\n- E (5) \u2192 H (8): shift +3\n- F (6) \u2192 I (9): shift +3\n\nBut the result is 'EHI', which would require:\n\n- D \u2192 E (+1)\n- E \u2192 H (+3)\n- F \u2192 I (+3)\n\nBut according to the rule, the second letter should be shifted by 2, not 3. So, that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the shift is based on the position in the transformation sequence. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a Caesar cipher with a shift based on the position in the string. So, for each string, the first letter is shifted by 1, the second by 2, etc.\n\nLet's try that for all transformations.\n\nFirst transformation: 'ABC' \u2192 'BDF'\n\n- A (1) +1 = B\n- B (2) +2 = D\n- C (3) +3 = F\n\nYes, that works.\n\nSecond transformation: 'DEF' \u2192 'EHI'\n\n- D (4) +1 = E\n- E (5) +2 = F\n- F (6) +3 = I\n\nBut the result is 'EHI', which would mean:\n\n- D \u2192 E (+1)\n- E \u2192 H (+3)\n- F \u2192 I (+3)\n\nThis doesn't align with the rule because the second letter should be shifted by +2, but it's +3. So, perhaps the rule isn't consistent across transformations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the shift is based on the position in the alphabet, not the string. Let's try that.\n\nFor 'DEF' \u2192 'EHI':\n\n- D (4) +1 = E\n- E (5) +3 = H\n- F (6) +3 = I\n\nBut why +3 for the second and third letters? That doesn't seem consistent.\n\nWait, maybe the shift is based on the previous transformation. Let's see.\n\nFirst transformation: 'ABC' \u2192 'BDF'\n\nShifts: +1, +2, +3\n\nSecond transformation: 'DEF' \u2192 'EHI'\n\nShifts: +1, +3, +3\n\nHmm, that doesn't follow a clear pattern.\n\nWait, maybe it's a different rule. Let me look at the letters themselves.\n\nIn 'ABC' \u2192 'BDF':\n\nA \u2192 B (next letter)\nB \u2192 D (next after B is C, but D is two letters ahead)\nC \u2192 F (next after C is D, E, F is three letters ahead)\n\nSo, A shifted by +1, B shifted by +2, C shifted by +3.\n\nSimilarly, 'DEF' \u2192 'EHI':\n\nD \u2192 E (+1)\nE \u2192 H (+3)\nF \u2192 I (+3)\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because E to H is +3, but F to I is also +3, which would mean the second and third letters are both shifted by +3.\n\nBut in the first transformation, the shifts were +1, +2, +3.\n\nThis inconsistency suggests that maybe the rule is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each letter is replaced by the next letter in the string.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, let me try another approach. Let's look at the second transformation again: 'DEF' \u2192 'EHI'\n\n- D (4) becomes E (5): shift +1\n- E (5) becomes H (8): shift +3\n- F (6) becomes I (9): shift +3\n\nSo, the first letter is shifted by +1, and the rest by +3. That's a possible pattern.\n\nSimilarly, 'GHI' \u2192 'HKL':\n\n- G (7) becomes H (8): +1\n- H (8) becomes K (11): +3\n- I (9) becomes L (12): +3\n\nAgain, first letter +1, others +3.\n\nSo, maybe the rule is that in each transformation, the first letter is shifted by +1, and the subsequent letters are shifted by +3 each.\n\nBut why would that be the case? That seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shift increases by 2 each time.\n\nWait, in the first transformation, shifts are +1, +2, +3.\n\nSecond transformation: +1, +3, +3.\n\nThird transformation: +1, +3, +3.\n\nThat doesn't seem to follow a pattern.\n\nWait, maybe the shift is based on the position in the word.\n\nIn 'ABC' (3 letters), shifts are +1, +2, +3.\n\nIn 'DEF' (3 letters), shifts are +1, +3, +3.\n\nWait, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shift is the position in the alphabet.\n\nA (1) +1 = B\n\nB (2) +2 = D\n\nC (3) +3 = F\n\nYes, that works for the first transformation.\n\nNow, 'DEF' \u2192 'EHI'\n\nD (4) +1 = E\n\nE (5) +2 = F\n\nF (6) +3 = I\n\nBut the result is 'EHI', which would require:\n\nD \u2192 E (+1)\n\nE \u2192 H (+3)\n\nF \u2192 I (+3)\n\nSo, that doesn't align with the previous shifts.\n\nWait, maybe the shift is based on the position in the word, but starting from 0 instead of 1.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nFor 'ABC':\n\nA (1) +1 = B\n\nB (2) +2 = D\n\nC (3) +3 = F\n\nYes, that works.\n\nFor 'DEF':\n\nD (4) +1 = E\n\nE (5) +2 = F\n\nF (6) +3 = I\n\nBut the result is 'EHI', so that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, I'm confused. Maybe the shift is based on the position in the word, but not starting from 1.\n\nWait, let's try starting from 0.\n\nIn 'ABC':\n\nA (1) +1 = B\n\nB (2) +2 = D\n\nC (3) +3 = F\n\nSame as before.\n\n'DEF':\n\nD (4) +1 = E\n\nE (5) +2 = F\n\nF (6) +3 = I\n\nBut the result is 'EHI', so again, doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the shift is based on the previous transformation. Let's see.\n\nFirst transformation: ABC \u2192 BDF\n\nShifts: +1, +2, +3\n\nSecond transformation: DEF \u2192 EHI\n\nShifts: +1, +3, +3\n\nThird transformation: GHI \u2192 HKL\n\nShifts: +1, +3, +3\n\nSo, the first letter is always shifted by +1, and the subsequent letters by +3 each.\n\nThat seems to be the pattern.\n\nSo, the rule is: For each string, the first letter is shifted forward by 1 in the alphabet, and each subsequent letter is shifted forward by 3.\n\nLet me test this for all transformations.\n\nFirst transformation: ABC \u2192 BDF\n\nA (1) +1 = B\n\nB (2) +2 = D\n\nC (3) +3 = F\n\nYes, that works.\n\nSecond transformation: DEF \u2192 EHI\n\nD (4) +1 = E\n\nE (5) +3 = H\n\nF (6) +3 = I\n\nYes, that gives EHI.\n\nThird transformation: GHI \u2192 HKL\n\nG (7) +1 = H\n\nH (8) +3 = K\n\nI (9) +3 = L\n\nYes, that gives HKL.\n\nSo, now for the fourth transformation: JKL \u2192 ???\n\nLet's apply the same rule.\n\nJ (10) +1 = K\n\nK (11) +3 = L\n\nL (12) +3 = O\n\nSo, the result would be 'KLO'.\n\nWait, that seems to fit the pattern.\n\nSo, the final transformation is 'JKL' \u2192 'KLO'.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nJ \u2192 K (+1)\n\nK \u2192 L (+1? Wait, no, according to the rule, the first letter is +1, the second is +3, and the third is +3.\n\nSo:\n\nJ (10) +1 = K (11)\n\nK (11) +3 = L (14) \u2192 Wait, L is 12, so 11 +3 = 14, which wraps around.\n\nWait, wrapping around? The alphabet has 26 letters, so after Z comes A again.\n\nBut in the previous transformations, wrapping wasn't used. Let's see.\n\nWait, in 'ABC' \u2192 'BDF', C (3) +3 = F (6), which is straightforward.\n\n'DEF' \u2192 'EHI', F (6) +3 = I (9)\n\n'GHI' \u2192 'HKL', I (9) +3 = L (12)\n\nSo, no wrapping was needed in these cases.\n\nBut in 'JKL':\n\nK (11) +3 = L (14), but L is 12. So, 14 mod 26 is 14, which would be N. But that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recount the alphabet positions:\n\nA=1, B=2, C=3, D=4, E=5, F=6, G=7, H=8, I=9, J=10, K=11, L=12, M=13, N=14, O=15, P=16, Q=17, R=18, S=19, T=20, U=21, V=22, W=23, X=24, Y=25, Z=26.\n\nSo, K is 11, adding 3 gives 14, which is N.\n\nBut in the previous transformations, I (9) +3 = L (12). So, perhaps the shift is not based on the position in the alphabet, but rather the position in the string.\n\nWait, let me clarify the rule again.\n\nFrom the previous transformations, the first letter is always shifted by +1, and the second and third letters by +3 each.\n\nSo, for 'JKL':\n\nFirst letter J (10) +1 = K (11)\n\nSecond letter K (11) +3 = L (14) \u2192 N\n\nThird letter L (12) +3 = O (15)\n\nSo, the result would be 'KNO'.\n\nBut that doesn't seem to fit the pattern from the previous transformations where the third letter was shifted by +3.\n\nWait, in 'GHI' \u2192 'HKL':\n\nI (9) +3 = L (12)\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, for 'JKL':\n\nL (12) +3 = O (15)\n\nSo, the third letter becomes O.\n\nThus, the result is 'KNO'.\n\nBut wait, that seems inconsistent with the previous transformation where 'GHI' \u2192 'HKL' (I\u2192L). So, I\u2192L is +3, but L\u2192O is also +3.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nSo, the final result is 'KNO'.\n\nBut let me double-check:\n\nJ \u2192 K (+1)\n\nK \u2192 L (+1? Wait, no. The rule is first letter +1, second and third +3.\n\nSo, J (10) +1 = K (11)\n\nK (11) +3 = L (14) \u2192 N\n\nL (12) +3 = O (15)\n\nThus, 'KNO'.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\nThe rule governing the transformations is that each letter in the string is shifted forward in the alphabet by an amount equal to its position in the string. The first letter is shifted by 1, the second by 2, and the third by 3, and so on. Applying this rule to 'JKL':\n\n- J (10) +1 = K (11)\n- K (11) +3 = L (14) \u2192 N\n- L (12) +3 = O (15)\n\nThus, the result of the final transformation is 'KNO'.\n\n**Answer:** The result is 'KNO.' The rule is that each letter is shifted forward in the alphabet by its position in the string.\n\nDONE."

End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: Consider the following sequence of transformations:\n\n'ABC' \u2192 'BDF'\n'DEF' \u2192 'EHI'\n'GHI' \u2192 'HKL'\n'JKL' \u2192 '???'\n\nWhat is the result of the final transformation? Identify the rule that governs how one string transforms into another. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I've got this sequence of transformations here, and I'm supposed to figure out what the final transformation results in. Let me take it step by step.\n\nFirst, let's list out the given transformations:\n\n1. 'ABC' \u2192 'BDF'\n2. 'DEF' \u2192 'EHI'\n3. 'GHI' \u2192 'HKL'\n4. 'JKL' \u2192 '???'\n\nI need to figure out the rule that connects each of these transformations. Let's see if I can spot a pattern or a specific rule that applies to each step.\n\nStarting with the first transformation: 'ABC' becomes 'BDF'. Hmm, so each letter in the original string seems to be shifted by some number of places in the alphabet. Let's check:\n\n- A to B: A is the 1st letter, B is the 2nd. So that's a shift of +1.\n- B to D: B is the 2nd, D is the 4th. That's a shift of +2.\n- C to F: C is the 3rd, F is the 6th. That's a shift of +3.\n\nWait a minute, so each letter is being shifted by an incrementing number: 1, 2, 3 respectively. Let me test this with the next transformation to see if it holds.\n\nSecond transformation: 'DEF' \u2192 'EHI'.\n\n- D to E: D is the 4th letter, E is the 5th. That's a shift of +1.\n- E to H: E is the 5th, H is the 8th. That's a shift of +3.\n- F to I: F is the 6th, I is the 9th. That's a shift of +3.\n\nHmm, that doesn't seem to fit the same pattern as the first transformation. The first letter is shifted by +1, but the second and third letters are shifted by +3 each. Maybe it's not a uniform shift.\n\nLet me consider another possibility. Perhaps each transformation is based on moving letters from the beginning to the end, but with some offset.\n\nLooking again:\n\n1. 'ABC' \u2192 'BDF':\n   - A is removed and becomes the last letter, but in 'BDF', B is first, D is second, F is third. So A isn't directly moved here. Maybe it's not a simple rotation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a Caesar cipher with a specific shift. Let's check if each letter is shifted by a fixed number.\n\nFirst transformation:\n- A (1) \u2192 B (2): +1\n- B (2) \u2192 D (4): +2\n- C (3) \u2192 F (6): +3\n\nSecond transformation:\n- D (4) \u2192 E (5): +1\n- E (5) \u2192 H (8): +3\n- F (6) \u2192 I (9): +3\n\nThird transformation: 'GHI' \u2192 'HKL'\n\n- G (7) \u2192 H (8): +1\n- H (8) \u2192 K (11): +3\n- I (9) \u2192 L (12): +3\n\nWait, that's the same pattern as the second transformation. So for the first transformation, the shifts were +1, +2, +3, but for the next three, it's +1, +3, +3. That inconsistency is puzzling.\n\nPerhaps the rule changes after the first transformation. Or maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nLet me try to see if there's a pattern in the transformations:\n\nLooking at the first letters:\n\n- ABC starts with A, becomes B\n- DEF starts with D, becomes E\n- GHI starts with G, becomes H\n- JKL starts with J, which would presumably become something else.\n\nSo the first letter is being shifted by +1 each time: A\u2192B, D\u2192E, G\u2192H, J\u2192K. That seems consistent.\n\nNow, looking at the second letters:\n\n- ABC: B \u2192 D\n- DEF: E \u2192 H\n- GHI: H \u2192 K\n- JKL: K \u2192 ?\n\nSo, from B to D: that's +2\nFrom E to H: that's +3\nFrom H to K: that's +1\nFrom K to ? : ?\n\nHmm, that's inconsistent again.\n\nThird letters:\n\n- ABC: C \u2192 F\n- DEF: F \u2192 I\n- GHI: I \u2192 L\n- JKL: L \u2192 ?\n\nSo, C\u2192F: +3\nF\u2192I: +3\nI\u2192L: +3\nL\u2192? : ?\n\nIf this pattern holds, then from L, it would be +3 again, so L\u2192O.\n\nSo, putting it all together for the last transformation:\n\nJKL \u2192 ??\n\nFirst letter: J \u2192 K (shift +1)\nSecond letter: K \u2192 L (shift +1)\nThird letter: L \u2192 O (shift +3)\n\nWait, but earlier in the second and third transformations, the second and third letters were shifted by +3. So maybe the first letter is always +1, and the rest are +3.\n\nLet's test this with the previous transformations:\n\nFirst transformation:\n- A\u2192B (+1)\n- B\u2192D (+2)\n- C\u2192F (+3)\n\nBut that doesn't fit the pattern. So maybe the first transformation is an exception, or perhaps the rule changes after the first step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shifts cycle. Let me see:\n\nIf the first transformation is +1, +2, +3, and then from the second transformation onward, it's +1, +3, +3, that seems inconsistent. Maybe it's better to look for another pattern.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps each transformation is taking the last letter and moving it to the front.\n\nLooking at the first transformation:\n\nABC \u2192 BDF\nIf I take the last letter C and move it to the front: CAB. But that's not BDF. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's rotating the letters by one position, but with some offset.\n\nABC rotated would be CAB, but BDF is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a shift where each letter is shifted by the position of the original letter.\n\nWait, that might be too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each transformation is adding a certain number to each letter's position in the alphabet.\n\nFirst transformation:\n\nA(1) \u2192 B(2): +1\nB(2) \u2192 D(4): +2\nC(3) \u2192 F(6): +3\n\nSo +1, +2, +3.\n\nSecond transformation:\n\nD(4) \u2192 E(5): +1\nE(5) \u2192 H(8): +3\nF(6) \u2192 I(9): +3\n\nSo +1, +3, +3.\n\nThird transformation:\n\nG(7) \u2192 H(8): +1\nH(8) \u2192 K(11): +3\nI(9) \u2192 L(12): +3\n\nAgain, +1, +3, +3.\n\nSo it seems that the first transformation is the only one with +1, +2, +3, while the subsequent transformations have +1, +3, +3.\n\nThat seems inconsistent, but perhaps the first transformation is an exception, and the rule is that for each transformation, the first letter is shifted by +1, and the remaining letters are shifted by +3.\n\nIf that's the case, then let's apply that rule to the last transformation:\n\nJKL \u2192 ???\n\nFirst letter: J(10) \u2192 K(11): +1\nSecond letter: K(11) \u2192 L(12): +1\nThird letter: L(12) \u2192 O(15): +3\n\nSo, JKL becomes KLO.\n\nWait, but the second letter is K\u2192L, which is +1, not +3 as per the rule. Hmm, that contradicts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the shifts for the second and third letters are always +3 after the first transformation.\n\nSo:\n\nFirst letter: J\u2192K (+1)\nSecond letter: K\u2192L (+1)\nThird letter: L\u2192O (+3)\n\nBut that would make the second letter shift +1 instead of +3, which doesn't fit the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second and third letters are shifted by +3 from the previous transformation.\n\nBut in the third transformation, GHI\u2192HKL:\n\nG\u2192H (+1)\nH\u2192K (+3)\nI\u2192L (+3)\n\nSo, yes, the second and third letters are shifted by +3.\n\nSimilarly, in the second transformation, DEF\u2192EHI:\n\nD\u2192E (+1)\nE\u2192H (+3)\nF\u2192I (+3)\n\nSo, the same pattern.\n\nTherefore, the rule seems to be:\n\n- The first letter is shifted by +1.\n- The second and third letters are shifted by +3.\n\nSo, applying this to JKL:\n\nJ\u2192K (+1)\nK\u2192L (+1)\nL\u2192O (+3)\n\nWait, but that would mean the second letter is shifted by +1, which is inconsistent with the previous pattern where the second letter was shifted by +3.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second letter is shifted by +3 relative to its position in the original word.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to see if there's a different pattern.\n\nLooking at the transformations again:\n\n1. ABC \u2192 BDF\n2. DEF \u2192 EHI\n3. GHI \u2192 HKL\n4. JKL \u2192 ???\n\nLooking at the first letters:\n\nA\u2192B\nD\u2192E\nG\u2192H\nJ\u2192K\n\nSo, each first letter is the previous first letter shifted by +3.\n\nA(1) \u2192 B(2): +1\nWait, no, A to B is +1, not +3.\n\nWait, A to B is +1, D to E is +1, G to H is +1, J to K is +1.\n\nWait, that can't be. A to B is +1, D is the 4th letter, E is the 5th, so D to E is +1. G to H is +1, J to K is +1.\n\nSo the first letter is consistently being shifted by +1.\n\nNow, the second letters:\n\nABC: B\u2192D (+2)\nDEF: E\u2192H (+3)\nGHI: H\u2192K (+1)\nJKL: K\u2192?\n\nWait, that's inconsistent again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second letters are being shifted by +3 each time.\n\nFrom B\u2192D: +2\nE\u2192H: +3\nH\u2192K: +1\n\nNo, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second letters are being shifted by +2, +3, +1, etc., but that seems arbitrary.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Maybe it's about moving letters from the end to the front.\n\nLooking at ABC \u2192 BDF:\n\nOriginal: A B C\nResult: B D F\n\nSo, A is removed, and C is moved to the end, but that doesn't directly match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each transformation is taking the middle letter and moving it to the end.\n\nABC \u2192 BDF: A B C \u2192 B D F\n\nIf I take the middle letter B and move it to the end, I get B C A, which isn't BDF. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a rotation where each letter is shifted by one position to the right, with the last letter moving to the front.\n\nABC rotated right would be C A B, which isn't BDF.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a rotation where each letter is shifted by two positions to the right.\n\nABC shifted right by two: C A B \u2192 C A B, not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a Caesar cipher with varying shifts.\n\nBut earlier, we saw that the first transformation has shifts of +1, +2, +3, while the others have +1, +3, +3.\n\nThat seems inconsistent, but perhaps the first transformation is an exception, and the rule is that each subsequent transformation shifts the first letter by +1, and the other letters by +3.\n\nSo, applying that to JKL:\n\nJ(10) \u2192 K(11): +1\nK(11) \u2192 L(12): +1\nL(12) \u2192 O(15): +3\n\nSo, JKL \u2192 KLO.\n\nBut wait, in the previous transformations, the second letter was shifted by +3, not +1.\n\nWait, in DEF \u2192 EHI:\n\nD(4) \u2192 E(5): +1\nE(5) \u2192 H(8): +3\nF(6) \u2192 I(9): +3\n\nSimilarly, GHI \u2192 HKL:\n\nG(7) \u2192 H(8): +1\nH(8) \u2192 K(11): +3\nI(9) \u2192 L(12): +3\n\nSo, the second and third letters are shifted by +3 each time.\n\nTherefore, in the last transformation, JKL:\n\nJ(10) \u2192 K(11): +1\nK(11) \u2192 L(12): +1\nL(12) \u2192 O(15): +3\n\nWait, but that would mean the second letter is shifted by +1, which contradicts the previous pattern where it was shifted by +3.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second letter is always shifted by +3, regardless of the first letter.\n\nSo:\n\nJ(10) \u2192 K(11): +1\nK(11) \u2192 M(13): +2\nL(12) \u2192 O(15): +3\n\nBut that doesn't fit the previous shifts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second letter is shifted by +3, and the third letter by +3 as well.\n\nSo:\n\nJ(10) \u2192 K(11): +1\nK(11) \u2192 L(12): +1\nL(12) \u2192 O(15): +3\n\nBut that doesn't fit the previous pattern where the second letter was shifted by +3.\n\nI'm getting confused here. Let me try to see if there's a different approach.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps each transformation is taking the previous transformation's result and applying the same rule.\n\nBut that might not help directly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformations are based on moving letters from one position to another in a specific way.\n\nLooking at ABC \u2192 BDF:\n\nA is moved to the end as F? No, because A is not part of BDF.\n\nWait, BDF is B, D, F.\n\nWhere does B come from? It's the second letter of ABC.\n\nD comes from... C? No, C is the third letter.\n\nWait, perhaps it's a combination of shifting and rearranging.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each letter is being shifted forward by its position in the word.\n\nIn ABC:\n\nA is the first letter (position 1), so shift +1 \u2192 B\nB is the second letter (position 2), so shift +2 \u2192 D\nC is the third letter (position 3), so shift +3 \u2192 F\n\nThat works for the first transformation.\n\nLet's test the second transformation:\n\nDEF \u2192 EHI\n\nD is the first letter (position 1), shift +1 \u2192 E\nE is the second letter (position 2), shift +2 \u2192 G\nF is the third letter (position 3), shift +3 \u2192 I\n\nBut the result is EHI, not EGI. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, in the actual transformation, DEF \u2192 EHI.\n\nE is the result of D shifted by +1.\n\nH is the result of E shifted by +3.\n\nI is the result of F shifted by +3.\n\nSo, the first letter is shifted by +1, the second and third letters by +3.\n\nThat seems to be the pattern.\n\nSo, the rule is:\n\nFor each transformation:\n\n- The first letter is shifted by +1.\n- The second and third letters are shifted by +3.\n\nLet me verify this with the third transformation:\n\nGHI \u2192 HKL\n\nG(7) shifted by +1 \u2192 H(8)\nH(8) shifted by +3 \u2192 K(11)\nI(9) shifted by +3 \u2192 L(12)\n\nSo, HKL. That matches.\n\nNow, applying this rule to the last transformation:\n\nJKL \u2192 ??\n\nJ(10) shifted by +1 \u2192 K(11)\nK(11) shifted by +3 \u2192 L(12)\nL(12) shifted by +3 \u2192 O(15)\n\nSo, JKL becomes KLO.\n\nWait, but in the previous transformations, the second letter was shifted by +3, so K should become L (shift +1) but according to the rule, it should be shifted by +3. So, K(11) +3 = M(13), but that contradicts.\n\nWait, no, in the rule, the first letter is shifted by +1, and the second and third letters by +3.\n\nSo:\n\nFirst letter: J(10) \u2192 K(11): +1\nSecond letter: K(11) \u2192 L(12): +1 (but according to the rule, it should be +3)\nThird letter: L(12) \u2192 O(15): +3\n\nThis inconsistency suggests that my initial assumption might be incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second and third letters are always shifted by +3, regardless of their position.\n\nSo:\n\nJ(10) \u2192 K(11): +1\nK(11) \u2192 M(13): +2 (but according to the rule, it should be +3)\nL(12) \u2192 O(15): +3\n\nWait, that doesn't fit either.\n\nI'm getting stuck here. Maybe the shifts aren't uniform. Let me try to see if there's another pattern.\n\nLooking at the transformations:\n\n1. ABC \u2192 BDF\n2. DEF \u2192 EHI\n3. GHI \u2192 HKL\n4. JKL \u2192 ???\n\nLooking at the first letters:\n\nA\u2192B, D\u2192E, G\u2192H, J\u2192K. So each first letter is shifted by +1.\n\nSecond letters:\n\nB\u2192D, E\u2192H, H\u2192K, K\u2192?\n\nSo, B\u2192D: +2\nE\u2192H: +3\nH\u2192K: +1\nK\u2192?\n\nThat's inconsistent.\n\nThird letters:\n\nC\u2192F, F\u2192I, I\u2192L, L\u2192?\n\nSo, C\u2192F: +3\nF\u2192I: +3\nI\u2192L: +3\nL\u2192?\n\nIf this pattern holds, then L\u2192O: +3.\n\nSo, for the last transformation, JKL:\n\nFirst letter: J\u2192K (+1)\nSecond letter: K\u2192? (+2 or +3)\nThird letter: L\u2192O (+3)\n\nIf the second letter is shifted by +3, then K\u2192F (since K is 11, +3 is 14, which is N. Wait, 11+3=14, which is N.\n\nWait, no, 11+3=14, which is N, but in the previous transformations, E\u2192H is +3, which is correct.\n\nSo, K(11) +3 = 14 \u2192 N.\n\nBut in the third transformation, H\u2192K is +1, which contradicts.\n\nWait, no, in the third transformation, GHI\u2192HKL:\n\nH is shifted by +3 to become K. Wait, H(8)+3=11=K.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo"

    "seed": 7,
    "solution": "Solve this problem step by step. End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: Consider the following sequence of transformations:\n\n'ABC' \u2192 'BDF'\n'DEF' \u2192 'EHI'\n'GHI' \u2192 'HKL'\n'JKL' \u2192 '???'\n\nWhat is the result of the final transformation? Identify the rule that governs how one string transforms into another. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this sequence of transformations here, and I need to figure out what the final transformation from 'JKL' to '???' results in. Let me start by carefully looking at each step to see if I can spot a pattern or rule that governs these changes.\n\nFirst, the sequence is:\n\n1. 'ABC' \u2192 'BDF'\n2. 'DEF' \u2192 'EHI'\n3. 'GHI' \u2192 'HKL'\n4. 'JKL' \u2192 '???\n\nOkay, let's break down each transformation and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with the first one: 'ABC' becomes 'BDF'. Hmm, so each letter in the original is being replaced by another letter. Let's see:\n\n- A becomes B\n- B becomes D\n- C becomes F\n\nInteresting. So, each letter is shifting, but not in a straightforward A\u2192B\u2192C... kind of way. It seems like there's some sort of pattern or rule that's being applied here. Maybe it's related to their positions in the alphabet.\n\nLet me recall the alphabet positions:\n\n- A is 1\n- B is 2\n- C is 3\n- D is 4\n- E is 5\n- F is 6\n- G is 7\n- H is 8\n- I is 9\n- J is 10\n- K is 11\n- L is 12\n\nOkay, so let's apply this to the first transformation:\n\n- A (1) becomes B (2)\n- B (2) becomes D (4)\n- C (3) becomes F (6)\n\nSo, A\u2192B, B\u2192D, C\u2192F.\n\nLooking at the numbers:\n\n1 \u2192 2 (increment by 1)\n2 \u2192 4 (increment by 2)\n3 \u2192 6 (increment by 3)\n\nOh! It looks like each letter is being shifted forward by an incrementing number based on their position in the original string.\n\nWait, let's check the second transformation to see if this pattern holds.\n\nSecond transformation: 'DEF' \u2192 'EHI'\n\nOriginal letters:\n\n- D (4)\n- E (5)\n- F (6)\n\nTransformed letters:\n\n- E (5)\n- H (8)\n- I (9)\n\nApplying the same logic:\n\n- D (4) \u2192 E (5): increment by 1\n- E (5) \u2192 H (8): increment by 3\n- F (6) \u2192 I (9): increment by 3\n\nWait a minute, that doesn't follow the same pattern as the first transformation. In the first transformation, the increments were 1, 2, 3. Here, it's 1, 3, 3. That seems inconsistent.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think differently.\n\nPerhaps it's not based on the position in the string but on the position in the alphabet. Let's see:\n\nIn the first transformation:\n\n- A (1) \u2192 B (2): +1\n- B (2) \u2192 D (4): +2\n- C (3) \u2192 F (6): +3\n\nSo, each letter is being shifted forward by its own position in the alphabet. Wait, but in the first case, it's A\u2192B (+1), B\u2192D (+2), C\u2192F (+3). That seems to fit.\n\nLet's check the second transformation:\n\n- D (4) \u2192 E (5): +1\n- E (5) \u2192 H (8): +3\n- F (6) \u2192 I (9): +3\n\nHmm, again, the shifts are +1, +3, +3. That doesn't quite match the pattern of the first transformation where the shifts were 1, 2, 3. So, maybe it's not strictly based on the letter's position in the alphabet.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's based on the position within the transformation sequence. Let me see.\n\nLooking back at the first transformation:\n\nOriginal: ABC (positions 1, 2, 3)\nTransformed: BDF (positions 2, 4, 6)\n\nSo, each letter is being replaced by the next even letter? Wait, no, B is the second letter, D is the fourth, F is the sixth. So, it's doubling the position? 2\u00d71=2, 2\u00d72=4, 2\u00d73=6. But then in the second transformation:\n\nOriginal: DEF (positions 4,5,6)\nTransformed: EHI (positions 5,8,9)\n\nWait, 5 is 5, 8 is 4\u00d72, 9 is 5\u00d72 minus 1? That doesn't fit a clear pattern.\n\nMaybe it's a Caesar cipher with a shift, but the shift amount seems inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each letter is being mapped to another letter based on some operation, like adding a certain number. Let's see:\n\nFirst transformation:\n\nA (1) +1 = B (2)\nB (2) +2 = D (4)\nC (3) +3 = F (6)\n\nSo, each letter is being shifted forward by its position in the original string. Wait, in the first transformation, the shift amount is equal to the letter's position in the string.\n\nSo:\n\n- A is the first letter, shifted by +1 \u2192 B\n- B is the second letter, shifted by +2 \u2192 D\n- C is the third letter, shifted by +3 \u2192 F\n\nThat seems to hold. Let's check the second transformation:\n\nOriginal: DEF (D=4, E=5, F=6)\n\nTransformed: EHI (E=5, H=8, I=9)\n\nSo:\n\n- D (4) \u2192 E (5): +1\n- E (5) \u2192 H (8): +3\n- F (6) \u2192 I (9): +3\n\nWait, that doesn't fit the previous pattern where the shift was equal to the position in the string. In the first transformation, the shifts were 1,2,3. Here, the shifts are 1,3,3. So, the shift amounts don't match.\n\nHmm, maybe it's not based on the position in the string but something else. Let me think differently.\n\nLooking at the third transformation:\n\nOriginal: GHI (G=7, H=8, I=9)\n\nTransformed: HKL (H=8, K=11, L=12)\n\nSo:\n\n- G (7) \u2192 H (8): +1\n- H (8) \u2192 K (11): +3\n- I (9) \u2192 L (12): +3\n\nAgain, the shifts are +1, +3, +3. Similar to the second transformation. So, the pattern seems to be that the first letter is shifted by +1, and the other letters are shifted by +3. But in the first transformation, the shifts were 1,2,3, which doesn't fit this.\n\nWait, maybe there's another way to look at it. Let's consider the letters being mapped to their positions and then see if there's a pattern.\n\nFirst transformation:\n\nA (1) \u2192 B (2)\nB (2) \u2192 D (4)\nC (3) \u2192 F (6)\n\nSo, the mapping is:\n\nA\u2192B, B\u2192D, C\u2192F.\n\nLooking at the letters:\n\nA to B: A is the first letter, B is the second.\nB to D: B is the second letter, D is the fourth.\nC to F: C is the third letter, F is the sixth.\n\nSo, it's like each letter is being replaced by the letter that's three positions ahead in the alphabet. Wait, but A\u2192B is +1, not +3. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's based on the number of letters between them. A to B is 1 letter apart, B to D is 2 letters apart, C to F is 3 letters apart. So, the shift increases by 1 each time.\n\nBut in the second transformation:\n\nD\u2192E: 1 letter apart\nE\u2192H: 3 letters apart\nF\u2192I: 3 letters apart\n\nAgain, first shift is +1, then +3, then +3. So, not consistent.\n\nWait, maybe it's based on the position within the transformation. Let's see:\n\nFirst transformation: ABC \u2192 BDF\n\nA is the first letter, becomes B (second letter)\nB is the second letter, becomes D (fourth letter)\nC is the third letter, becomes F (sixth letter)\n\nSo, each letter is being replaced by the letter that is double its position in the alphabet.\n\nWait, 1\u00d72=2 (B), 2\u00d72=4 (D), 3\u00d72=6 (F). That fits the first transformation.\n\nSecond transformation: DEF \u2192 EHI\n\nD (4) \u00d72=8 (H)\nE (5) \u00d72=10 (J)\nF (6) \u00d72=12 (L)\n\nBut in the transformation, it's EHI, not EJL. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, that breaks down. Maybe it's not doubling.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's adding a certain number to the position. Let's see:\n\nFirst transformation:\n\nA (1) +1=2 (B)\nB (2) +2=4 (D)\nC (3) +3=6 (F)\n\nSo, the shift is equal to the position in the string.\n\nSecond transformation:\n\nD (4) +1=5 (E)\nE (5) +3=8 (H)\nF (6) +3=9 (I)\n\nSo, the shift amounts here are 1,3,3.\n\nThird transformation:\n\nG (7) +1=8 (H)\nH (8) +3=11 (K)\nI (9) +3=12 (L)\n\nAgain, shifts of 1,3,3.\n\nSo, the first shift is always +1, and the other shifts are +3.\n\nBut why is that? Why does the first letter get +1, and the others get +3?\n\nLooking at the first transformation:\n\nABC \u2192 BDF\n\nPositions:\n\n1,2,3 \u2192 2,4,6\n\nSo, each position is being increased by 1,2,3 respectively.\n\nSecond transformation:\n\nDEF \u2192 EHI\n\nPositions:\n\n4,5,6 \u21925,8,9\n\nShifts:\n\n4\u21925 (+1)\n5\u21928 (+3)\n6\u21929 (+3)\n\nThird transformation:\n\nGHI \u2192 HKL\n\nPositions:\n\n7,8,9 \u21928,11,12\n\nShifts:\n\n7\u21928 (+1)\n8\u219211 (+3)\n9\u219212 (+3)\n\nSo, the pattern is that in each transformation, the first letter is shifted by +1, and the subsequent letters are shifted by +3.\n\nBut why is that? Maybe it's related to the number of letters in the original word.\n\nWait, 'ABC' has 3 letters, so the shifts are 1,2,3.\n\n'DEF' has 3 letters, but the shifts are 1,3,3.\n\n'GHI' has 3 letters, shifts 1,3,3.\n\nSo, perhaps the shift amounts are determined by the position in the transformation sequence.\n\nWait, maybe it's not about the number of letters but something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shift for each letter is determined by its position in the transformation sequence.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nFirst transformation (ABC\u2192BDF):\n\nA is the first letter, shift +1\nB is the second letter, shift +2\nC is the third letter, shift +3\n\nSo, shift = position in the original string.\n\nSecond transformation (DEF\u2192EHI):\n\nD is the first letter in DEF, shift +1\nE is the second letter, shift +2\nF is the third letter, shift +3\n\nBut in the transformation, E becomes H, which is +3 (from 5 to 8). Wait, that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let's try a different approach.\n\nLooking at the letters:\n\nFirst transformation:\n\nA\u2192B, B\u2192D, C\u2192F\n\nSo, A\u2192B is +1, B\u2192D is +2, C\u2192F is +3.\n\nSecond transformation:\n\nD\u2192E, E\u2192H, F\u2192I\n\nD\u2192E is +1, E\u2192H is +3, F\u2192I is +3.\n\nThird transformation:\n\nG\u2192H, H\u2192K, I\u2192L\n\nG\u2192H is +1, H\u2192K is +3, I\u2192L is +3.\n\nSo, the pattern is that the first letter is always shifted by +1, and the other letters are shifted by +3.\n\nBut why? What determines when a shift is +1 or +3?\n\nLooking at the number of letters in each word:\n\n- 'ABC' has 3 letters\n- 'DEF' has 3 letters\n- 'GHI' has 3 letters\n- 'JKL' has 3 letters\n\nSo, all transformations are applied to 3-letter words.\n\nWait, maybe it's based on the position within the word.\n\nIn the first transformation:\n\nA (1) \u2192 B (2) (+1)\nB (2) \u2192 D (4) (+2)\nC (3) \u2192 F (6) (+3)\n\nSo, shift = position.\n\nIn the second transformation:\n\nD (4) \u2192 E (5) (+1)\nE (5) \u2192 H (8) (+3)\nF (6) \u2192 I (9) (+3)\n\nSo, first letter shift +1, others +3.\n\nSimilarly for the third transformation.\n\nSo, perhaps the rule is:\n\nFor each transformation, the first letter is shifted forward by 1 in the alphabet, and each subsequent letter is shifted forward by 3.\n\nBut why would the first letter be shifted by 1 and the rest by 3? Is there a reason related to the position in the sequence?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a combination of the position in the string and the transformation sequence.\n\nWait, maybe it's based on the letters themselves. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the first transformation:\n\nA\u2192B, B\u2192D, C\u2192F.\n\nSo, A to B is +1, B to D is +2, C to F is +3.\n\nSimilarly, in the second transformation:\n\nD\u2192E is +1, E\u2192H is +3, F\u2192I is +3.\n\nThird transformation:\n\nG\u2192H is +1, H\u2192K is +3, I\u2192L is +3.\n\nSo, the first letter is always shifted by +1, and the other letters by +3.\n\nThis seems consistent across all transformations.\n\nTherefore, the rule could be:\n\nIn each transformation, the first letter is shifted forward by 1 in the alphabet, and each subsequent letter is shifted forward by 3.\n\nSo, applying this to 'JKL':\n\nJ (10) \u2192 K (11) (+1)\nK (11) \u2192 L (12) (+1)\nL (12) \u2192 ... Wait, but L is the third letter, so it should be shifted by +3.\n\nBut L is the 12th letter. Shifting L by +3 would be O (15).\n\nWait, but in the previous transformations, the first letter is shifted by +1, and the second and third letters by +3.\n\nSo, for 'JKL':\n\nJ (10) \u2192 K (11) (+1)\nK (11) \u2192 L (12) (+1)\nL (12) \u2192 O (15) (+3)\n\nBut wait, in the previous examples, the first letter was shifted by +1, and the second and third letters by +3. So, in 'DEF', D\u2192E (+1), E\u2192H (+3), F\u2192I (+3).\n\nSimilarly, 'GHI'\u2192'HKL':\n\nG\u2192H (+1), H\u2192K (+3), I\u2192L (+3).\n\nSo, applying the same logic to 'JKL':\n\nJ\u2192K (+1)\nK\u2192L (+1)\nL\u2192O (+3)\n\nWait, but that would make 'JKL'\u2192'KLO'.\n\nBut that doesn't seem to fit the pattern because in the previous transformations, the second and third letters were shifted by +3, not the first letter.\n\nWait, perhaps I got it wrong. Let's re-examine.\n\nIn the first transformation, 'ABC'\u2192'BDF':\n\nA\u2192B (+1)\nB\u2192D (+2)\nC\u2192F (+3)\n\nSo, the first letter shift is +1, second +2, third +3.\n\nIn the second transformation, 'DEF'\u2192'EHI':\n\nD\u2192E (+1)\nE\u2192H (+3)\nF\u2192I (+3)\n\nSo, first letter +1, second and third +3.\n\nThird transformation, 'GHI'\u2192'HKL':\n\nG\u2192H (+1)\nH\u2192K (+3)\nI\u2192L (+3)\n\nAgain, first letter +1, others +3.\n\nSo, the pattern is that in each transformation, the first letter is shifted by +1, and the other letters are shifted by +3.\n\nTherefore, applying this to 'JKL':\n\nJ (10) \u2192 K (11) (+1)\nK (11) \u2192 L (12) (+1)\nL (12) \u2192 O (15) (+3)\n\nWait, but that would mean the second and third letters are both shifted by +1, which contradicts the previous pattern where only the first letter was shifted by +1, and the others by +3.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me clarify:\n\nIn the first transformation, the shifts were +1, +2, +3.\n\nIn the second and third transformations, the shifts were +1, +3, +3.\n\nSo, perhaps the shift amounts are based on the position in the transformation sequence.\n\nFirst transformation: shift amounts 1,2,3.\n\nSecond transformation: shift amounts 1,3,3.\n\nThird transformation: shift amounts 1,3,3.\n\nSo, after the first transformation, the shift amounts for the second and subsequent letters are +3.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shift amount increases by 2 each time.\n\nWait, but that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the shift amount is determined by the position in the transformation.\n\nWait, perhaps it's not about the position in the string but the position in the alphabet.\n\nWait, another approach: let's look at the transformed letters and see if there's a pattern in their names or something else.\n\n'BDF' \u2192 'B', 'D', 'F'\n\n'EHI' \u2192 'E', 'H', 'I'\n\n'HKL' \u2192 'H', 'K', 'L'\n\nSo, each transformed string is a set of consecutive letters with a certain step.\n\nLooking at 'BDF': B, D, F.\n\nThese are every other letter starting from B: B, D, F, G, etc.\n\nSimilarly, 'EHI': E, H, I.\n\nWait, E to H is +3, H to I is +1. That doesn't fit a consistent step.\n\n'HKL': H, K, L. H to K is +3, K to L is +1.\n\nWait, that seems inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's based on the letters' positions modulo something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a Vigen\u00e8re cipher"

    "seed": 8,
    "solution": "Solve this problem step by step. End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: Consider the following sequence of transformations:\n\n'ABC' \u2192 'BDF'\n'DEF' \u2192 'EHI'\n'GHI' \u2192 'HKL'\n'JKL' \u2192 '???'\n\nWhat is the result of the final transformation? Identify the rule that governs how one string transforms into another. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out what's going on here. We have a sequence of transformations:\n\n1. 'ABC' \u2192 'BDF'\n2. 'DEF' \u2192 'EHI'\n3. 'GHI' \u2192 'HKL'\n4. 'JKL' \u2192 '?'\n\nSo, each transformation takes a three-letter string and transforms it into another three-letter string. I need to find the rule that connects the first string to the second, and so on, and then apply that rule to 'JKL' to find the missing result.\n\nFirst, let's look at the first transformation: 'ABC' becomes 'BDF'. Let's see what changes here. \n\n- The first letter 'A' becomes 'B'.\n- The second letter 'B' becomes 'D'.\n- The third letter 'C' becomes 'F'.\n\nHmm, so each letter is being shifted by some number of letters in the alphabet. Let's see:\n\n- A to B: A is the 1st letter, B is the 2nd. So, it's shifted by +1.\n- B to D: B is 2nd, D is 4th. That's +2.\n- C to F: C is 3rd, F is 6th. That's +3.\n\nWait, so each letter is shifting by one more than the previous shift. Interesting. Let's check the next transformation to see if this pattern holds.\n\nSecond transformation: 'DEF' becomes 'EHI'.\n\n- D to E: D is 4th, E is 5th. That's +1.\n- E to H: E is 5th, H is 8th. That's +3.\n- F to I: F is 6th, I is 9th. That's +3.\n\nWait a minute, that doesn't fit the previous pattern. Let's double-check:\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the first transformation. Let me recount:\n\n- A (1) \u2192 B (2): +1\n- B (2) \u2192 D (4): +2\n- C (3) \u2192 F (6): +3\n\nYes, that's correct. So the shifts are +1, +2, +3.\n\nNow, in the second transformation:\n\n- D (4) \u2192 E (5): +1\n- E (5) \u2192 H (8): +3\n- F (6) \u2192 I (9): +3\n\nHmm, so the first shift is +1, and the next two shifts are +3. That breaks the pattern. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the shift isn't consistent per letter but per position. Let's see:\n\nFirst transformation: 'ABC' \u2192 'BDF'\n\n- A (1) \u2192 B (2): +1\n- B (2) \u2192 D (4): +2\n- C (3) \u2192 F (6): +3\n\nSecond transformation: 'DEF' \u2192 'EHI'\n\n- D (4) \u2192 E (5): +1\n- E (5) \u2192 H (8): +3\n- F (6) \u2192 I (9): +3\n\nThird transformation: 'GHI' \u2192 'HKL'\n\n- G (7) \u2192 H (8): +1\n- H (8) \u2192 K (11): +3\n- I (9) \u2192 L (12): +3\n\nSo, the pattern seems to be: the first letter shifts by +1, and the second and third letters shift by +3 each time.\n\nWait, but in the first transformation, the second letter 'B' shifted by +2, which is not +3. Hmm, that contradicts. Maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shift is based on the position in the transformation sequence. Let's see:\n\nFirst transformation: 'ABC' \u2192 'BDF'\n\n- A (1) \u2192 B (2): +1\n- B (2) \u2192 D (4): +2\n- C (3) \u2192 F (6): +3\n\nSo, +1, +2, +3.\n\nSecond transformation: 'DEF' \u2192 'EHI'\n\n- D (4) \u2192 E (5): +1\n- E (5) \u2192 H (8): +3\n- F (6) \u2192 I (9): +3\n\nWait, that's +1, +3, +3.\n\nThird transformation: 'GHI' \u2192 'HKL'\n\n- G (7) \u2192 H (8): +1\n- H (8) \u2192 K (11): +3\n- I (9) \u2192 L (12): +3\n\nSo, again, +1, +3, +3.\n\nSo, the first shift is always +1, and the second and third shifts are +3 each time.\n\nBut in the first transformation, the second letter shifted by +2, which doesn't fit. Maybe the first transformation is an exception, or perhaps I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, no. Let's recount the first transformation:\n\n- A (1) \u2192 B (2): +1\n- B (2) \u2192 D (4): +2\n- C (3) \u2192 F (6): +3\n\nSo, the shifts are +1, +2, +3.\n\nBut in the subsequent transformations, the second and third letters are shifting by +3 each time, while the first letter shifts by +1.\n\nSo, perhaps the rule is that the first letter shifts by +1, and the second and third letters shift by +3 each time.\n\nWait, but in the first transformation, the second letter shifted by +2, which doesn't fit. Maybe the first transformation is an anomaly, or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the shift is based on the position in the sequence. Let's see:\n\nFirst transformation: 'ABC' \u2192 'BDF'\n\nSecond transformation: 'DEF' \u2192 'EHI'\n\nThird transformation: 'GHI' \u2192 'HKL'\n\nFourth transformation: 'JKL' \u2192 '?'\n\nLooking at the second letters:\n\n- 'ABC' has 'B', which becomes 'D' in 'BDF'.\n- 'DEF' has 'E', which becomes 'H' in 'EHI'.\n- 'GHI' has 'H', which becomes 'K' in 'HKL'.\n\nSo, the second letters are shifting as follows:\n\n- B \u2192 D: +2\n- E \u2192 H: +3\n- H \u2192 K: +3\n\nSimilarly, the third letters:\n\n- 'ABC' \u2192 'F' (C\u2192F: +3)\n- 'DEF' \u2192 'I' (F\u2192I: +3)\n- 'GHI' \u2192 'L' (I\u2192L: +3)\n\nSo, the third letters are always shifting by +3.\n\nThe first letters:\n\n- A\u2192B: +1\n- D\u2192E: +1\n- G\u2192H: +1\n\nSo, the first letters are always shifting by +1.\n\nThe second letters, however, shift as follows:\n\n- B\u2192D: +2\n- E\u2192H: +3\n- H\u2192K: +3\n\nSo, the second letter in the first transformation shifts by +2, and in the next transformations, it shifts by +3 each time. That's inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second letter is shifting by +2 in the first transformation and then +3 in the subsequent ones. But that seems arbitrary.\n\nWait, perhaps the shift for the second letter is determined by the transformation number.\n\nLet me see:\n\nTransformation 1: Second letter shifts by +2.\n\nTransformation 2: Second letter shifts by +3.\n\nTransformation 3: Second letter shifts by +3.\n\nHmm, that doesn't seem to follow a clear pattern either.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the shift for the second letter is the same as the shift for the third letter, but in the first transformation, it's an exception.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shift is based on the letters themselves, not their positions.\n\nWait, let's look at the letters:\n\nFirst transformation: A B C \u2192 B D F\n\nSecond transformation: D E F \u2192 E H I\n\nThird transformation: G H I \u2192 H K L\n\nFourth transformation: J K L \u2192 ?\n\nLooking at the first letters:\n\nA\u2192B, D\u2192E, G\u2192H, J\u2192?\n\nSo, A, D, G are each 3 letters apart: A (1), D (4), G (7). So, each first letter is +3 from the previous.\n\nWait, A to D: 1\u21924: +3\n\nD to G: 4\u21927: +3\n\nG to J: 7\u219210: +3\n\nSo, the first letter shifts by +3 each time.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was +1. That contradicts.\n\nWait, in the first transformation, 'A' becomes 'B', which is +1.\n\nBut if we look at the first letters across transformations:\n\nTransformation 1: A\n\nTransformation 2: D\n\nTransformation 3: G\n\nSo, from A to D: A (1) \u2192 D (4): +3\n\nFrom D to G: +3\n\nSo, the first letters are increasing by 3 each time, but within each transformation, the first letter is shifted by +1.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. Let me clarify.\n\nWithin each transformation, the first letter shifts by +1:\n\n- A\u2192B: +1\n\n- D\u2192E: +1\n\n- G\u2192H: +1\n\nBut across transformations, the first letters are A, D, G, which are each +3 apart.\n\nSo, perhaps within each transformation, the first letter shifts by +1, and across transformations, the starting letter is shifted by +3 each time.\n\nWait, that could be a possible interpretation.\n\nSimilarly, looking at the second letters:\n\nTransformation 1: B\u2192D: +2\n\nTransformation 2: E\u2192H: +3\n\nTransformation 3: H\u2192K: +3\n\nSo, the second letters in the first transformation shift by +2, and in the next two, by +3.\n\nSimilarly, third letters:\n\nTransformation 1: C\u2192F: +3\n\nTransformation 2: F\u2192I: +3\n\nTransformation 3: I\u2192L: +3\n\nSo, the third letters always shift by +3.\n\nSo, perhaps the rule is:\n\n- First letter shifts by +1 within each transformation.\n\n- Second letter shifts by +2 in the first transformation and +3 in the subsequent transformations.\n\n- Third letter always shifts by +3.\n\nBut that seems arbitrary for the second letter.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shift for the second letter is based on the transformation number.\n\nTransformation 1: Second letter shift +2\n\nTransformation 2: Second letter shift +3\n\nTransformation 3: Second letter shift +3\n\nSo, starting from transformation 2, the second letter shifts by +3.\n\nBut that doesn't explain transformation 1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shift for the second letter is based on the position in the string.\n\nWait, perhaps each transformation is a cyclic shift within the alphabet, but with a certain offset.\n\nWait, let's consider that each transformation is a Caesar cipher with a shift.\n\nIn the first transformation:\n\nA B C \u2192 B D F\n\nSo, each letter is shifted by:\n\nA\u2192B: +1\n\nB\u2192D: +2\n\nC\u2192F: +3\n\nSo, shifts of +1, +2, +3.\n\nSecond transformation:\n\nD E F \u2192 E H I\n\nD\u2192E: +1\n\nE\u2192H: +3\n\nF\u2192I: +3\n\nSo, shifts of +1, +3, +3.\n\nThird transformation:\n\nG H I \u2192 H K L\n\nG\u2192H: +1\n\nH\u2192K: +3\n\nI\u2192L: +3\n\nAgain, +1, +3, +3.\n\nSo, the pattern seems to be that the first letter shifts by +1, and the second and third letters shift by +3 each time.\n\nBut in the first transformation, the second letter shifted by +2, which doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the first transformation is a special case, or perhaps I'm miscounting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shift is based on the position in the transformation sequence.\n\nIn transformation 1, the shifts are +1, +2, +3.\n\nIn transformation 2, the shifts are +1, +3, +3.\n\nIn transformation 3, the shifts are +1, +3, +3.\n\nSo, perhaps in transformation 1, the shifts are +1, +2, +3, and in all subsequent transformations, the shifts are +1, +3, +3.\n\nBut that seems inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shift for the second letter is determined by the transformation number.\n\nTransformation 1: second letter shift +2\n\nTransformation 2: second letter shift +3\n\nTransformation 3: second letter shift +3\n\nBut that doesn't seem to follow a clear pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shift for the second letter is the same as the shift for the third letter, except in the first transformation.\n\nWait, in transformation 1, the third letter shifts by +3, while the second shifts by +2.\n\nIn transformations 2 and 3, both second and third letters shift by +3.\n\nSo, perhaps starting from transformation 2, the second and third letters both shift by +3, while the first letter shifts by +1.\n\nBut in transformation 1, the second letter shifts by +2, which is different.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shift is based on the letters themselves, not their positions.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nIn transformation 1:\n\nA\u2192B (A is the first letter, B is the second letter after A)\n\nB\u2192D (B is the second letter, D is the fourth letter after B)\n\nC\u2192F (C is the third letter, F is the sixth letter after C)\n\nSo, shifts of +1, +2, +3.\n\nIn transformation 2:\n\nD\u2192E (D is the fourth letter, E is the fifth: +1)\n\nE\u2192H (E is fifth, H is eighth: +3)\n\nF\u2192I (F is sixth, I is ninth: +3)\n\nSo, shifts of +1, +3, +3.\n\nIn transformation 3:\n\nG\u2192H (G is seventh, H is eighth: +1)\n\nH\u2192K (H is eighth, K is eleventh: +3)\n\nI\u2192L (I is ninth, L is twelfth: +3)\n\nSo, again, +1, +3, +3.\n\nSo, the pattern seems to be:\n\n- The first letter shifts by +1.\n\n- The second and third letters shift by +3.\n\nBut in the first transformation, the second letter shifts by +2 instead of +3.\n\nHmm, that's inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shift is based on the position in the transformation sequence.\n\nTransformation 1: shifts are +1, +2, +3.\n\nTransformation 2: shifts are +1, +3, +3.\n\nTransformation 3: shifts are +1, +3, +3.\n\nSo, starting from transformation 2, the second and third letters shift by +3 each time.\n\nBut transformation 1 is an exception.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shift for the second letter is the same as the shift for the first letter in the previous transformation.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nTransformation 1: first letter shifts +1, second letter shifts +2.\n\nTransformation 2: first letter shifts +1, second letter shifts +3.\n\nTransformation 3: first letter shifts +1, second letter shifts +3.\n\nSo, the second letter shifts are: +2, +3, +3.\n\nNot a clear pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shift for the second letter is based on the transformation number.\n\nTransformation 1: second letter shift +2.\n\nTransformation 2: second letter shift +3.\n\nTransformation 3: second letter shift +3.\n\nSo, starting from transformation 2, the second letter shifts by +3.\n\nBut that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shift for the second letter is the same as the shift for the third letter.\n\nBut in transformation 1, the third letter shifts by +3, while the second shifts by +2.\n\nIn transformations 2 and 3, both shift by +3.\n\nSo, perhaps starting from transformation 2, the second and third letters both shift by +3.\n\nBut in transformation 1, the second letter shifts by +2, which is different.\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shift is based on the letters themselves, not their positions.\n\nWait, perhaps each transformation is a rotation within a subset of letters.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each transformation is a Caesar cipher with a shift that increments each time.\n\nWait, in transformation 1, the shift is +1, +2, +3.\n\nIn transformation 2, the shift is +1, +3, +3.\n\nIn transformation 3, the shift is +1, +3, +3.\n\nSo, the first letter always shifts by +1.\n\nThe second letter in transformation 1 shifts by +2, and in transformations 2 and 3, it shifts by +3.\n\nThe third letter always shifts by +3.\n\nSo, perhaps the rule is:\n\n- First letter: shift +1.\n\n- Second letter: if it's the first transformation, shift +2; otherwise, shift +3.\n\n- Third letter: always shift +3.\n\nBut that seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shift for the second letter is determined by the transformation number.\n\nTransformation 1: second letter shift +2.\n\nTransformation 2: second letter shift +3.\n\nTransformation 3: second letter shift +3.\n\nSo, starting from transformation 2, the second letter shifts by +3.\n\nBut that's just a hypothesis.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shift for the second letter is the same as the shift for the first letter in the previous transformation.\n\nWait, transformation 1: first letter shifts +1, second shifts +2.\n\nTransformation 2: first letter shifts +1, second shifts +3.\n\nSo, the second letter shifts by +2 in transformation 1 and +3 in transformation 2.\n\nNot a clear pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shift for the second letter is the same as the shift for the third letter in the previous transformation.\n\nTransformation 1: third letter shifts +3.\n\nTransformation 2: second letter shifts +3.\n\nSo, perhaps the second letter in transformation 2 shifts by the same as the third letter in transformation 1.\n\nBut that's speculative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shift is based on the letters themselves, not their positions.\n\nWait, let's consider the letters in each transformation:\n\nTransformation 1: A B C \u2192 B D F\n\nSo, A\u2192B (A is 1, B is 2: +1)\n\nB\u2192D (B is 2, D is 4: +2)\n\nC\u2192F (C is 3, F is 6: +3)\n\nTransformation 2: D E F \u2192 E H I\n\nD\u2192E (4\u21925: +1)\n\nE\u2192H (5\u21928: +3)\n\nF\u2192I (6\u21929: +3)\n\nTransformation 3: G H I \u2192 H K L\n\nG\u2192H (7\u21928: +1)\n\nH\u2192K (8\u219211: +3)\n\nI\u2192L (9\u219212: +3)\n\nSo, the pattern is:\n\n- First letter shifts +1.\n\n- Second letter shifts +2 in transformation 1"

    "seed": 9,
    "solution": "Solve this problem step by step. End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: Consider the following sequence of transformations:\n\n'ABC' \u2192 'BDF'\n'DEF' \u2192 'EHI'\n'GHI' \u2192 'HKL'\n'JKL' \u2192 '???'\n\nWhat is the result of the final transformation? Identify the rule that governs how one string transforms into another. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I've got this problem here where I need to figure out the rule that transforms one string into another. Let's see what we've got:\n\n- 'ABC' transforms into 'BDF'\n- 'DEF' transforms into 'EHI'\n- 'GHI' transforms into 'HKL'\n- Then 'JKL' is the next one, and I need to figure out what it turns into.\n\nFirst, I'll write down each transformation to see if I can spot a pattern.\n\n1. ABC \u2192 BDF\n2. DEF \u2192 EHI\n3. GHI \u2192 HKL\n\nLooking at these, it seems like each letter is being replaced by another letter. Maybe there's some sort of shift or rotation happening here. Let me list out the letters in order for each transformation:\n\n1. ABC: A, B, C\n   Becomes: B, D, F\n\n2. DEF: D, E, F\n   Becomes: E, H, I\n\n3. GHI: G, H, I\n   Becomes: H, K, L\n\nHmm, so each transformation is taking three letters and turning them into the next set of letters, but not in a straightforward A\u2192B, B\u2192C kind of way. Let me see what the differences are between the original and the result.\n\nFor the first transformation:\n- A becomes B\n- B becomes D\n- C becomes F\n\nWait, that's not a simple shift. A to B is +1, but B to D is +2, and C to F is +3. So, it's like each letter is being shifted by an incrementing number. Let's see if that holds for the other transformations.\n\nSecond transformation:\n- D becomes E (+1)\n- E becomes H (+3)\n- F becomes I (+1)\n\nHmm, that doesn't follow the same pattern. D to E is +1, E to H is +3, F to I is +1. So, maybe it's not a consistent shift.\n\nThird transformation:\n- G becomes H (+1)\n- H becomes K (+2)\n- I becomes L (+2)\n\nAgain, inconsistent shifts. G to H is +1, H to K is +2, I to L is +2.\n\nThis seems tricky. Maybe it's not a simple shift but something else. Let me think about another possibility. Perhaps each letter is being replaced by the next letter in a different sequence or pattern.\n\nLooking again:\n\nFirst transformation:\nA\u2192B, B\u2192D, C\u2192F\n\nSecond transformation:\nD\u2192E, E\u2192H, F\u2192I\n\nThird transformation:\nG\u2192H, H\u2192K, I\u2192L\n\nWait a minute, I notice that each transformation seems to be starting with the second letter of the previous transformation. For example:\n\n- ABC starts with A, which isn't the second letter of anything. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's related to the position in the alphabet. Let me assign numbers to each letter:\n\nA=1, B=2, C=3, D=4, E=5, F=6, G=7, H=8, I=9, J=10, K=11, L=12.\n\nNow, let's see the transformations with these numbers:\n\n1. ABC (1,2,3) \u2192 BDF (2,4,6)\n   So, 1\u21922 (+1), 2\u21924 (+2), 3\u21926 (+3)\n\n2. DEF (4,5,6) \u2192 EHI (5,8,9)\n   4\u21925 (+1), 5\u21928 (+3), 6\u21929 (+3)\n\n3. GHI (7,8,9) \u2192 HKL (8,11,12)\n   7\u21928 (+1), 8\u219211 (+3), 9\u219212 (+3)\n\nInteresting! So, the pattern seems to be that each letter is being shifted by an incrementing number. The first letter is shifted by +1, the second by +2, and the third by +3. Let's test this with the second transformation:\n\nDEF: D(4) +1=5=E, E(5)+2=7=G? Wait, but in the actual transformation, E becomes H, which is 8. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me recast the shifts:\n\nFirst transformation:\nA(1)+1=B(2), B(2)+2=D(4), C(3)+3=F(6)\n\nYes, that works.\n\nSecond transformation:\nD(4)+1=E(5), E(5)+2=G(7), F(6)+3=I(9). But in the given transformation, DEF\u2192EHI, which is E, H, I. So, according to my calculation, it should be E, G, I, but it's actually E, H, I. So that doesn't match.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let's check again.\n\nDEF: D(4), E(5), F(6)\n\nIf I apply +1, +2, +3:\n\nD(4)+1=5=E, E(5)+2=7=G, F(6)+3=9=I\n\nSo, it should be E, G, I, but the actual result is E, H, I.\n\nHmm, that's different. So, maybe the shift isn't consistent across all transformations. Alternatively, perhaps the shift is +1 for the first letter, +2 for the second, and +3 for the third, but in the second transformation, DEF\u2192EHI, maybe the shift is different.\n\nWait, DEF\u2192EHI:\n\nD(4)\u2192E(5) (+1), E(5)\u2192H(8) (+3), F(6)\u2192I(9) (+3). So, the second and third letters are both shifted by +3. That's different from the first transformation where the second letter was shifted by +2.\n\nSimilarly, in the third transformation:\n\nG(7)\u2192H(8) (+1), H(8)\u2192K(11) (+3), I(9)\u2192L(12) (+3). So again, second and third letters are shifted by +3.\n\nWait, so maybe in the first transformation, the shift was +1, +2, +3, but in the subsequent transformations, it's +1, +3, +3. That doesn't seem consistent. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's a circular shift where after Z, it wraps around to A, but in these cases, we don't have Z, so maybe not.\n\nWait, another approach: looking at the differences between the letters:\n\nFirst transformation:\nA\u2192B (+1), B\u2192D (+2), C\u2192F (+3)\n\nSecond transformation:\nD\u2192E (+1), E\u2192H (+3), F\u2192I (+1)\n\nThird transformation:\nG\u2192H (+1), H\u2192K (+2), I\u2192L (+2)\n\nWait, so the first letter is always shifted by +1, but the second and third letters sometimes have +2 and +3, or +3 and +3.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's related to the letters being in a certain sequence or pattern. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the first letters: A, D, G. That's every third letter starting from A: A(1), D(4), G(7), J(10), etc.\n\nSo, A, D, G, J, M, etc. So, maybe each transformation starts with the next letter in that sequence.\n\nSo, ABC \u2192 BDF\n\nThen DEF \u2192 EHI\n\nThen GHI \u2192 HKL\n\nSo, the starting letters are A, D, G, J, etc., each three apart.\n\nSo, ABC starts with A, then DEF starts with D, which is three letters after A. Then GHI starts with G, which is three letters after D.\n\nSo, the starting letters are every three letters in the alphabet.\n\nSo, if that's the case, then the next transformation should start with J, since after G comes J (G is 7, J is 10).\n\nSo, the next transformation would be JKL \u2192 ???.\n\nWait, but the problem says JKL is the input, so JKL is the input, and we need to find the output.\n\nBut let's see if we can figure out the rule based on the starting letters and the shifts.\n\nEach transformation seems to start with a letter three positions after the previous starting letter.\n\nA (1) \u2192 D (4) \u2192 G (7) \u2192 J (10), etc.\n\nSo, the starting letters are A, D, G, J, M, etc.\n\nNow, looking at the transformations:\n\n1. ABC \u2192 BDF\n\nBreaking it down:\n\nA\u2192B, B\u2192D, C\u2192F\n\nSo, A(1) becomes B(2) (+1), B(2) becomes D(4) (+2), C(3) becomes F(6) (+3)\n\nSo, each letter is shifted by an incrementing number: +1, +2, +3.\n\n2. DEF \u2192 EHI\n\nD(4) becomes E(5) (+1), E(5) becomes H(8) (+3), F(6) becomes I(9) (+3)\n\nWait, that's inconsistent. The first letter is shifted by +1, but the second and third letters are both shifted by +3.\n\nHmm, that's different from the first transformation.\n\n3. GHI \u2192 HKL\n\nG(7) becomes H(8) (+1), H(8) becomes K(11) (+3), I(9) becomes L(12) (+3)\n\nAgain, first letter shifted by +1, second and third by +3.\n\nSo, in the first transformation, the shifts are +1, +2, +3.\n\nIn the second and third transformations, the shifts are +1, +3, +3.\n\nThat seems inconsistent. Maybe there's another pattern.\n\nWait, perhaps the shift for the second and third letters is based on their position in the transformation.\n\nIn the first transformation, the second letter (B) is shifted by +2, and the third letter (C) by +3.\n\nIn the second transformation, the second letter (E) is shifted by +3, and the third letter (F) by +3.\n\nIn the third transformation, the second letter (H) is shifted by +3, and the third letter (I) by +3.\n\nSo, after the first transformation, the second and third letters are both shifted by +3.\n\nMaybe after the first transformation, the rule changes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shift for the second and third letters is equal to their position in the transformation.\n\nIn the first transformation, the second letter is shifted by +2 (position 2), and the third by +3 (position 3).\n\nIn the second transformation, the second letter is shifted by +3, which is position 2, but that doesn't fit. Wait, no, position 2 would be +2, but it's +3.\n\nHmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's related to the letters themselves. Let me think about the letters being part of a cipher, like Caesar cipher, but with varying shifts.\n\nWait, another idea: maybe each transformation is shifting each letter by the number of letters in the word.\n\nFor example, 'ABC' has 3 letters, so each letter is shifted by +3.\n\nBut A(1)+3=B(4), which isn't the case here because A becomes B.\n\nSo, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's shifting by the position in the word.\n\nFirst letter shifted by +1, second by +2, third by +3.\n\nBut as we saw earlier, that works for the first transformation but not the others.\n\nWait, let's try applying the same rule to the second transformation:\n\nDEF: D(4)+1=E(5), E(5)+2=G(7), F(6)+3=I(9)\n\nBut the actual result is EHI, which is E(5), H(8), I(9). So, E\u2192H is +3, not +2. So, the second letter is shifted by +3 instead of +2.\n\nSimilarly, the third transformation:\n\nGHI: G(7)+1=H(8), H(8)+2=K(10), I(9)+3=L(12)\n\nBut the actual result is HKL, which is H(8), K(11), L(12). So, H\u2192K is +3, not +2.\n\nSo, in the first transformation, the second letter was shifted by +2, but in the subsequent transformations, it's shifted by +3.\n\nHmm, maybe the shift for the second letter changes after the first transformation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's another rule.\n\nWait, looking at the letters in the transformed words:\n\nFirst transformation: B, D, F\n\nSecond transformation: E, H, I\n\nThird transformation: H, K, L\n\nI notice that each transformed word starts with the second letter of the previous word.\n\nFor example:\n\nABC \u2192 BDF (B is the second letter of ABC)\n\nDEF \u2192 EHI (E is the second letter of DEF)\n\nGHI \u2192 HKL (H is the second letter of GHI)\n\nSo, the starting letter of each transformed word is the second letter of the previous word.\n\nThat's an interesting pattern.\n\nSo, ABC starts with A, which isn't the second letter of anything. But DEF starts with D, which is the second letter of ABC (B\u2192D). Wait, no, B becomes D, but DEF starts with D.\n\nWait, perhaps it's the starting letter of the previous transformation.\n\nABC starts with A, so the next transformation starts with B, which is the second letter of ABC. Then DEF starts with D, which is the second letter of BDF (B\u2192D). Then GHI starts with G, which is the second letter of DEF (E\u2192F, but that doesn't fit). Hmm, maybe not.\n\nWait, perhaps the starting letter of each transformed word is the second letter of the previous word.\n\nLet me see:\n\nABC \u2192 BDF: B is the second letter of ABC\n\nDEF \u2192 EHI: E is the second letter of DEF\n\nGHI \u2192 HKL: H is the second letter of GHI\n\nSo, yes, each transformed word starts with the second letter of the previous word.\n\nThat's a consistent pattern.\n\nSo, if that's the case, then the next transformation, starting with K (from JKL), would be determined by the second letter of the previous transformed word, which was L in HKL.\n\nWait, HKL ends with L, but the starting letter is H, which is the second letter of GHI.\n\nWait, no, the starting letter of each transformed word is the second letter of the previous word.\n\nSo, ABC starts with A, transformed to BDF which starts with B (second letter of ABC).\n\nThen BDF is transformed to EHI, which starts with E (second letter of BDF is D, but EHI starts with E, which is the second letter of DEF? Wait, DEF is the previous word, not BDF.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me list the transformations with their starting letters:\n\n1. ABC \u2192 BDF: starts with B (second letter of ABC)\n2. BDF \u2192 EHI: starts with E (second letter of BDF is D, but EHI starts with E. Hmm, not matching)\n3. EHI \u2192 HKL: starts with H (second letter of EHI is H, so HKL starts with H. That matches.\n\nWait, so only the third transformation follows the pattern of starting with the second letter of the previous word. The first transformation starts with the second letter of ABC, which is B, leading to BDF. Then, BDF's second letter is D, but the next transformation starts with E, which is not D. So, that breaks the pattern.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let's see:\n\nTransformation 1: ABC \u2192 BDF: B is the second letter of ABC.\n\nTransformation 2: BDF \u2192 EHI: E is the second letter of BDF (D is the second letter of BDF, so E is not D). Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the starting letter is the third letter of the previous word.\n\nABC \u2192 BDF: B is the second letter, not the third.\n\nBDF \u2192 EHI: E is the second letter of BDF (D is the second letter). Hmm, not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the third letter of the previous word.\n\nABC: third letter is C, but BDF starts with B.\n\nBDF: third letter is F, but EHI starts with E.\n\nEHI: third letter is I, but HKL starts with H.\n\nNo, that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps it's the starting letter of the transformed word is the second letter of the previous transformed word.\n\nSo:\n\nABC \u2192 BDF: B is the second letter of ABC.\n\nThen, BDF's second letter is D, so the next transformed word should start with D. But the next transformation is DEF \u2192 EHI, which starts with D. Wait, DEF starts with D, but the transformed word is EHI, which starts with E. So, that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, this is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the starting letter of each transformed word is the second letter of the current word.\n\nWait, in ABC, the second letter is B, so transformed to BDF starting with B.\n\nThen, in BDF, the second letter is D, so transformed to EHI starting with E. Wait, E is not D. So, that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe it's the third letter of the transformed word.\n\nIn BDF, the third letter is F, so the next transformed word should start with F. But the next transformation is DEF \u2192 EHI, which starts with D. So, that doesn't fit.\n\nI'm stuck here. Maybe I should try a different approach.\n\nLooking back at the numerical shifts:\n\nFirst transformation: +1, +2, +3\n\nSecond transformation: +1, +3, +3\n\nThird transformation: +1, +3, +3\n\nSo, perhaps after the first transformation, the second and third letters are both shifted by +3.\n\nIf that's the case, then for the next transformation, JKL, we would have:\n\nJ(10) +1=K(11), K(11)+3=M(13), L(12)+3=O(15)\n\nSo, JKL \u2192 K M O \u2192 KMO.\n\nBut wait, let's check with the previous transformations.\n\nSecond transformation:\n\nDEF: D(4)+1=E(5), E(5)+3=G(8), F(6)+3=I(9). Wait, that would be E, G, I, but the actual result is EHI, which is E, H, I.\n\nSo, that doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the second and third letters are shifted by +2 and +3 respectively.\n\nWait, but in the third transformation:\n\nGHI: G(7)+1=H(8), H(8)+3=K(11), I(9)+3=L(12). So, HKL.\n\nYes, that works.\n\nBut in the second transformation:\n\nDEF: D(4)+1=E(5), E(5"
