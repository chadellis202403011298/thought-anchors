  "question": "A small community library has received a donation of $1,000 to improve their services. They want to use this money to address three main needs: purchasing new books, upgrading their computer system, and creating a small children's reading area. New books cost $15 each, the computer system upgrade requires a minimum investment of $400, and creating a functional children's area would cost at least $250. The library director wants to allocate the funds in a way that addresses all three needs while maximizing the number of new books they can purchase. How should the library allocate the $1,000, and how many new books can they buy?",
  "answer": "To solve this problem, we need to identify the constraints and find the optimal allocation of resources.\n\nGiven information:\n- Total budget: $1,000\n- New books: $15 each\n- Computer system upgrade: minimum $400\n- Children's reading area: minimum $250\n- Must address all three needs\n- Goal: Maximize number of new books purchased\n\nStep 1: Identify the fixed minimum costs that must be spent.\n- Computer system: $400\n- Children's reading area: $250\n- Total minimum fixed costs: $400 + $250 = $650\n\nStep 2: Calculate remaining funds for books.\n- Remaining funds = $1,000 - $650 = $350\n\nStep 3: Calculate how many books can be purchased with the remaining funds.\n- Number of books = $350 \u00f7 $15 = 23.33 books\n- Since we can't buy a partial book, we can purchase 23 books.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the final allocation.\n- Computer system upgrade: $400\n- Children's reading area: $250\n- New books (23 \u00d7 $15): $345\n- Total spent: $400 + $250 + $345 = $995\n- Remaining: $5 (which is insufficient for another book)\n\nTherefore, the optimal allocation is to spend $400 on the computer system upgrade, $250 on the children's reading area, and $345 on 23 new books, with $5 remaining unspent."
