They want to use this money to address three main needs: purchasing new books, upgrading their computer system, and creating a small children's reading area. New books cost $15 each, the computer system upgrade requires a minimum investment of $400, and creating a functional children's area would cost at least $250. The library director wants to allocate the funds in a way that addresses all three needs while maximizing the number of new books they can purchase. How should the library allocate the $1,000, and how many new books can they buy? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I've got this problem here about a library that received a $1,000 donation. They need to allocate this money to three main projects: buying new books, upgrading their computer system, and creating a children's reading area. The goal is to figure out how to distribute the funds so that all three needs are addressed, but especially to maximize the number of new books they can buy. \n\nFirst, let me break down the costs for each project. New books are $15 each. The computer system upgrade requires a minimum investment of $400, which I'm assuming is the starting point\u2014so they can't spend less than that if they choose to upgrade the system. Then there's the children's area, which needs at least $250 to be functional. \n\nSo, the total amount they have is $1,000. They need to cover all three areas: books, computer system, and children's area. The director wants to maximize the number of new books, which suggests that the library should spend as much as possible on books while still meeting the minimum requirements for the other two projects. \n\nLet me think about this step by step. If they want to maximize the number of books, they should minimize the amount spent on the other two projects. That makes sense because every dollar allocated to books allows them to buy more books. So, the strategy here is to set aside the minimum necessary for the computer system and the children's area, and then use the remaining money for books.\n\nThe computer system needs a minimum of $400, and the children's area needs at least $250. Let me add those two together: 400 + 250 equals $650. So, if they allocate $650 to these two projects, that leaves them with 1000 - 650 = $350 to spend on new books. \n\nNow, each new book costs $15. So, how many books can they buy with $350? To find that, I'll divide 350 by 15. Let me do that calculation: 350 \u00f7 15. Hmm, 15 times 23 is 345, which is just under 350. So, they can buy 23 books with $350, and have $5 left over. But since they can't buy a fraction of a book, they'll have to stick with 23. \n\nWait, but let me double-check that. If they spend $650 on the computer and children's area, that leaves $350 for books. 350 divided by 15 is indeed 23.333... So, they can buy 23 full books. The leftover $5 can't be used for another book since it's less than the cost of one. \n\nIs there a way to reallocate the remaining money to get an extra book? Let's see. If they reduce the amount allocated to one of the other projects, can they free up enough to buy another book? Let's explore that.\n\nSuppose they reduce the computer system upgrade from $400 to a slightly lower amount, say $390. That would free up $10, making the total for computer $390. Then, the children's area remains at $250. So, the total allocated to non-books would be 390 + 250 = $640. That leaves $1,000 - $640 = $360 for books. Now, 360 \u00f7 15 is 24. So, they can buy 24 books with $360. That's one more book than before. \n\nInteresting! So, by reducing the computer system's budget by $10, they can afford one extra book. But wait, is $390 a valid amount for the computer system? The problem states that the computer system requires a \"minimum investment\" of $400. So, they can't go below $400 because the system won't function properly otherwise. Therefore, they can't reduce the computer system's allocation below $400. \n\nSimilarly, the children's area requires a minimum of $250. So, they can't reduce that either. Therefore, they can't decrease either of those to get more money for books. That means the initial allocation of $400 for the computer and $250 for the children's area, totaling $650, is the minimum they can spend on those two. \n\nThus, the maximum number of books they can buy is 23, with $5 leftover. \n\nAlternatively, let's see if there's another way to maximize the number of books by adjusting both projects. Suppose they reduce the computer system by $x and the children's area by $y, such that 400 - x + 250 - y is less than or equal to 650, but we want to spend as little as possible on both to maximize books. But since both have minimums, they can't go below those. So, they can't reduce either further. Therefore, the initial allocation is indeed the minimum for the other two, allowing the maximum for books.\n\nTherefore, the optimal allocation is $400 for the computer system, $250 for the children's area, and $350 for books, resulting in 23 books.\n</think>\n\nThe library should allocate $400 to the computer system upgrade, $250 to the children's reading area, and the remaining $350 to purchasing new books. With $350, they can buy 23 new books at $15 each.\n\n**Allocation:**\n- Computer System Upgrade: $400\n- Children's Reading Area: $250\n- New Books: $350 (23 books)\n\n**Number of New Books Purchased:** 23\n\nDONE."

How should the library allocate the $1,000, and how many new books can they buy? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I've got this problem here about a small community library that received a donation of $1,000. They want to use this money to address three main needs: buying new books, upgrading their computer system, and creating a children's reading area. Let me try to figure out how to allocate the funds so they can maximize the number of new books they can purchase.\n\nFirst, let me break down the costs associated with each need. New books cost $15 each. The computer system upgrade requires a minimum investment of $400. And creating the children's area would cost at least $250. So, they have a total of $1,000 to spend.\n\nI think the goal here is to allocate the $1,000 in such a way that they can buy as many new books as possible, while also meeting the minimum requirements for the computer upgrade and the children's area. That makes sense because buying more books is likely the primary objective, given that the library is probably focused on expanding their collection to serve the community better.\n\nSo, let's denote the number of new books they can buy as 'x'. Each book costs $15, so the total cost for books would be 15x.\n\nNow, the computer system upgrade has a minimum requirement of $400. That means they have to spend at least $400 on that, but they can choose to spend more if they want. Similarly, the children's reading area needs to cost at least $250. Again, they could spend more, but the problem doesn't specify any maximum, so I think we can assume they just need to meet the minimums.\n\nSo, the total amount allocated to books, computer, and children's area should add up to $1,000. Let's write that as an equation:\n\n15x + 400 + 250 = 1000\n\nWait, let me make sure that's correct. The computer upgrade is $400 minimum, so that's a fixed cost. The children's area is $250 minimum, also a fixed cost. The remaining money will go to buying books. So yes, 15x plus 400 plus 250 equals 1000.\n\nLet me add those fixed costs first. 400 plus 250 is 650. So, 15x + 650 = 1000.\n\nTo find x, I'll subtract 650 from both sides:\n\n15x = 1000 - 650\n15x = 350\n\nNow, divide both sides by 15 to solve for x:\n\nx = 350 / 15\n\nHmm, let's do that division. 15 goes into 350 how many times? 15 times 23 is 345, which leaves a remainder of 5. So, x is 23 and 5/15, which simplifies to 23 and 1/3. But you can't buy a third of a book, so they can only buy 23 books.\n\nWait, does that make sense? Let me check my math again. 15 times 23 is 345. If they spend 345 on books, plus 400 on the computer and 250 on the children's area, that's 345 + 400 + 250. Let's add those up: 345 + 400 is 745, and 745 + 250 is 995. Hmm, that's only $995. There's still $5 left unallocated. But the problem doesn't specify what to do with any remaining funds. It just says they have $1,000 to allocate. So, maybe they can use that extra $5 wherever they want, but the main goal is to maximize the number of books, so perhaps they should allocate all their remaining funds to books.\n\nWait, but in my initial equation, I set it to exactly $1,000, so maybe I should see if they can allocate the remaining $5 to books as well. Let me see. If they have $5 left, can they buy 5/15 of a book? No, because you can't buy a fraction of a book. So, they can only buy 23 full books, and the remaining $5 can't be used for another book. So, the maximum number of books they can buy is 23.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they could adjust the allocations to spend all $1,000. Let me think. If they spend $400 on the computer and $250 on the children's area, that's $650. Then, with the remaining $350, they can buy 350 / 15 = 23.333... books, which is still 23 full books, with $5 leftover. So, either way, they can't buy more than 23 books without reducing the amount allocated to either the computer or the children's area.\n\nBut wait, perhaps they could reallocate some funds from the computer or the children's area to buy more books. Let's explore that. Suppose they decide to spend more than the minimum on one of the other needs to free up money for more books. For example, if they spend $400 on the computer as the minimum, but if they don't need to spend more there, they can't get any extra money for books. Similarly, for the children's area, they have to spend at least $250, so they can't reduce that to get more money for books unless they're willing to compromise on one of the needs.\n\nBut the problem states that they want to address all three needs, so they can't reduce the minimums. Therefore, they have to spend at least $400 on the computer and $250 on the children's area, leaving them with $350 for books. So, 350 / 15 is approximately 23.333, which means 23 books. The remaining $5 can't be used for another book, so that's the maximum they can do without reducing any of the minimum allocations.\n\nAlternatively, if they could reduce one of the minimums, they could buy more books, but the problem specifies that they need to meet all three needs, meaning they have to spend at least those amounts. Therefore, the maximum number of books they can buy is 23, with $5 leftover that they can't use for anything else unless they're willing to reduce one of the other needs, which they can't do because they need to address all three.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the library should allocate $400 to the computer upgrade, $250 to the children's area, and use the remaining $350 for buying books, which allows them to purchase 23 new books.\n</think>\n\nThe library should allocate $400 to the computer upgrade, $250 to the children's area, and the remaining $350 to buying new books. With $350, they can purchase 23 new books at $15 each.\n\n**Answer:** The library should allocate $400 to the computer upgrade, $250 to the children's area, and $350 to new books, allowing them to buy 23 new books.

How should the library allocate the $1,000, and how many new books can they buy? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out how the library director can allocate the $1,000 donation to address all three needs: purchasing new books, upgrading the computer system, and creating a children's reading area. The goal is to maximize the number of new books they can buy. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's list out the costs for each need:\n\n1. **New books**: Each book costs $15.\n2. **Computer system upgrade**: Minimum investment is $400.\n3. **Children's reading area**: Minimum cost is $250.\n\nThe total amount they have is $1,000. They need to allocate this amount across the three needs. The library director wants to maximize the number of new books, which means I need to figure out how much money can be allocated to new books after covering the minimum required investments for the other two needs.\n\nSo, the first thing to do is calculate the minimum amount needed for the computer system and the children's area. That would be:\n\n$400 (computer) + $250 (children's area) = $650.\n\nSubtracting this from the total donation gives the remaining amount that can be allocated to new books:\n\n$1,000 (total) - $650 (minimum for computer and children's area) = $350.\n\nNow, with $350 left, I can calculate how many new books they can buy:\n\n$350 / $15 per book = approximately 23.333.\n\nSince you can't buy a fraction of a book, they would need to round down to the nearest whole number. So, 23 books.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should double-check if there's a way to adjust the allocations to see if more books can be bought by perhaps not allocating the minimums. Hmm, but the problem states that the computer system upgrade requires a minimum investment of $400 and the children's area a minimum of $250. So, they can't go below those amounts. Therefore, the maximum number of books is indeed 23.\n\nLet me just summarize:\n\n- **Computer System**: $400\n- **Children's Area**: $250\n- **Books**: $350 (which gives 23 books)\n\nAdding these up: 400 + 250 + (23*15) = 400 + 250 + 345 = 995. Wait, that's only $995. We have $1,000, so there's an extra $5. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in calculation.\n\nWait, 23 books at $15 each is 23*15 = $345. So, 400 + 250 + 345 = 995. Yes, that's correct. There's a leftover of $5. But since the requirements are met, and we can't use the extra $5 to buy more books because the other two needs are already at their minimums. So, we can't buy an extra book with just $5.\n\nAlternatively, maybe if we reduce one of the other needs slightly, we can use the extra $5 to buy one more book. Let's see:\n\nIf we spend $400 on the computer and $250 on the children's area, that's $650. Then $350 left for books, which is 23 books, totaling $995. The remaining $5 can't be used for another book because each book is $15. So, the maximum number of books is 23.\n\nTherefore, the allocation is:\n\n- Computer System: $400\n- Children's Area: $250\n- Books: $350 (23 books)\n\nTotal allocation: $400 + $250 + $345 = $995, leaving $5 unused.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"create a small children's reading area would cost at least $250.\" So, maybe they can spend more than $250 if needed, but they must spend at least $250. Similarly, the computer system requires a minimum of $400. So, if we increase either of those, we might have to decrease the books.\n\nBut since the goal is to maximize the number of books, we need to keep the other two at their minimums. Therefore, the initial allocation is correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\nAllocate $400 to the computer system, $250 to the children's area, and $350 to new books, allowing them to purchase 23 new books.\n</think>\n\nThe library should allocate $400 to the computer system upgrade, $250 to the children's reading area, and the remaining $350 to purchasing new books.

They want to use this money wisely to address all three needs, but especially to maximize the number of new books they can buy. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out how much money they can allocate to each of these three areas. The goal is to maximize the number of books, so I should probably spend as little as possible on the other two needs. Let's see how that works.\n\nEach new book costs $15. To maximize the number of books, I should minimize the money spent on the computer upgrade and the children's area. The computer system requires a minimum investment of $400, and the children's area needs at least $250. So, the least they can spend on both is $400 + $250 = $650.\n\nIf I subtract that from the total $1,000, that leaves $1,000 - $650 = $350 for buying new books. Now, with $350, how many books can they buy? Since each book is $15, I divide 350 by 15. Let's do that: 350 \u00f7 15 equals approximately 23.333. But you can't buy a third of a book, so they can only buy 23 whole books. That leaves some money unused, but it's better than not having enough for the computer or the children's area.\n\nWait, but is there a way to adjust the amounts to get more books without spending too much on the other things? Let's think. If they increase the amount spent on the computer system beyond the minimum, they might have to decrease the children's area or the books. But since the computer is a higher priority, maybe it's better to keep it at the minimum. Similarly, for the children's area, it's a necessity, so keeping it at the minimum is better for maximizing books.\n\nSo, yes, spending $400 on the computer and $250 on the children's area leaves them with $350 for books, which gives 23 books. If they tried to spend more on one, they'd have to spend less on another, which would mean fewer books overall. For example, if they spend $500 on the computer, they'd only have $500 left, but that would require the children's area to be $0, which isn't allowed because it needs at least $250. So they can't do that.\n\nAlternatively, if they spend $250 on the computer, but that's below the minimum. The computer upgrade requires a minimum investment of $400, so they can't go below that. So, the minimums are fixed.\n\nTherefore, the optimal allocation is $400 for the computer, $250 for the children's area, and $350 for books, resulting in 23 new books.\n</think>\n\nThe library should allocate $400 towards upgrading their computer system, $250 towards creating the children's reading area, and the remaining $350 towards purchasing new books.

How should the library allocate the $1,000, and how many new books can they buy? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nFirst, I'll define the variables. Let\u2019s say the number of new books they purchase is represented by x.\n\nThe cost of purchasing x books is 15 times x, which is 15x.\n\nNext, the computer system upgrade requires a minimum investment of $400.

    "solution": "Solve this problem step by step. End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: A small community library has received a donation of $1,000 to improve their services. They want to use this money to address three main needs: purchasing new books, upgrading their computer system, and creating a small children's reading area. New books cost $15 each, the computer system upgrade requires a minimum investment of $400, and creating a functional children's area would cost at least $250. The library director wants to allocate the funds in a way that addresses all three needs while maximizing the number of new books they can purchase. How should the library allocate the $1,000, and how many new books can they buy? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I need to help the library figure out how to allocate the $1,000 donation to cover the three main needs: buying new books, upgrading the computer system, and creating a children's reading area. The goal is to maximize the number of new books they can purchase. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let me list out the costs associated with each need:\n\n- New books cost $15 each.\n- The computer system upgrade requires a minimum investment of $400.\n- Creating a functional children's area costs at least $250.\n\nThe total amount they have is $1,000. They want to allocate this money in a way that covers all three needs, but especially focuses on buying as many new books as possible.\n\nSo, if I want to maximize the number of books, I should try to minimize the amount spent on the other two needs. That way, more money is left for books. The minimum investments required for the computer system and the children's area are $400 and $250, respectively.\n\nLet me add those minimums together: $400 (computer) + $250 (children's area) = $650.\n\nNow, subtracting that from the total donation: $1,000 - $650 = $350.\n\nThis remaining $350 can be used to buy new books. Since each book costs $15, I can calculate how many books that would give them:\n\n$350 \u00f7 $15 per book = 23.333... So, they can buy 23 full books with $15 each, and have some leftover money. Wait, but $350 divided by 15 is actually 23 and 1/3 books, which isn't possible because you can't buy a fraction of a book. So, they can buy 23 books, using up $23 * $15 = $345, and have $5 left over. But that's not enough to buy another book. Hmm, maybe I need to adjust the allocation.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider if there's a way to reallocate some funds to allow more books. Let me think differently. Maybe I don't have to stick strictly to the minimums for the computer and children's area. Maybe I can allocate a bit more to one of them to allow more books.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet x = number of new books.\nLet y = amount allocated to computer system upgrade.\nLet z = amount allocated to children's area.\n\nWe have the following constraints:\n\n1. 15x + y + z = 1000\n2. y \u2265 400\n3. z \u2265 250\n4. x, y, z \u2265 0\n\nWe need to maximize x.\n\nTo maximize x, we need to minimize y and z as much as possible. The minimums are y=400 and z=250, as given. So, substituting these into the first equation:\n\n15x + 400 + 250 = 1000\n15x + 650 = 1000\n15x = 1000 - 650\n15x = 350\nx = 350 / 15 \u2248 23.333\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a book, we take the floor of 23.333, which is 23 books. That would leave us with 350 - (23*15) = 350 - 345 = $5 leftover. But since we can't spend that $5 on anything else because the minimums are already met, we have to leave it unallocated. Alternatively, we can see if we can adjust y or z to use up that $5.\n\nWait, if we increase y by $5, making it $405, then z remains $250. Then, the total spent would be 405 + 250 = 655, so 1000 - 655 = 345, which is exactly 23 books. But that doesn't help us buy more books. Alternatively, if we increase z by $5, making it $255, then y remains $400, total spent is 400 + 255 = 655, same as before, leaving $345 for books, which is still 23.\n\nAlternatively, what if we decrease y by some amount and increase z, but that would likely reduce the number of books. Let me see: if we decrease y by $10, making it $390, and increase z by $10, making it $260, total spent is 390 + 260 = 650, leaving $350 for books, which is 350/15 \u224823.333, same as before. So, no gain.\n\nAlternatively, what if we don't meet the minimums? But the problem states that they need to address all three needs, so they can't go below the minimums. So, the minimums must be met.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of books they can buy is 23, with $5 left over that can't be used because it's less than the next book's cost.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me recalculate:\n\nIf y=400 and z=250, total spent on other needs is 650. So, 1000 - 650 = 350. 350 divided by 15 is 23.333. So, 23 books, costing 345, leaving 5. So, the answer is 23 books.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the remaining $5 to buy part of a book, but that doesn't make sense because you can't buy a fraction of a book. So, it's 23 books.\n\nBut let me check another approach. Suppose they don't meet the minimums but allocate more to one of them to allow more books. Wait, but the problem says they have to address all three needs, so they have to meet the minimums. So, they can't go below 400 and 250.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem allows for exceeding the minimums, but to minimize the total spent on the other two to maximize books. So, the way I did it before is correct.\n\nSo, the allocation would be:\n\n- Computer system upgrade: $400\n- Children's area: $250\n- Books: $350, which buys 23 books.\n\nWait, but 23 books at $15 each is $345, leaving $5. So, total spent would be 400 + 250 + 345 = 995, leaving $5 unallocated. But the problem says they have $1,000, so maybe they can use that $5 for something else, but the problem doesn't specify any other needs. So, perhaps it's acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, if they use the $5 to buy another book, but since 15*24=360, which is more than 350, so they can't. Therefore, 23 is the maximum number.\n\nSo, the allocation would be:\n\n- Computer: $400\n- Children's area: $250\n- Books: $350, buying 23 books.\n\nBut wait, 350 is not divisible by 15 exactly, so they have $5 left. So, perhaps the library can use that $5 elsewhere, but since there are no other specified needs, it's better to just stick with 23 books.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem allows for partial books, but in reality, you can't buy a fraction of a book, so 23 is the answer.\n\nSo, to sum up, the library should allocate $400 to the computer system, $250 to the children's area, and the remaining $350 to buying new books, which allows them to purchase 23 books.\n</think>\n\nThe library should allocate $400 to the computer system upgrade, $250 to the children's reading area, and the remaining $350 to purchasing new books. With $350, they can buy 23 new books at $15 each.\n\nAllocation:\n- Computer system upgrade: $400\n- Children's reading area: $250\n- New books: $350 (23 books)\n\n**Final Answer:** The library can purchase 23 new books by allocating $400 to the computer system, $250 to the children's area, and using the remaining $350 for books. \n\nDONE."

The library director wants to allocate the funds in a way that addresses all three needs while maximizing the number of new books they can purchase. How should the library allocate the $1,000, and how many new books can they buy? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so the library has $1,000 to spend on three things: new books, a computer system upgrade, and a children's reading area. They want to maximize the number of new books they can buy. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that each new book costs $15. The computer system needs at least $400, and the children's area needs at least $250. So, the minimum for the computer and the children's area combined is $400 + $250 = $650. That leaves $1,000 - $650 = $350 for new books. \n\nIf they use all the remaining money for books, they can buy 350 / 15 = 23.333... So, they can buy 23 whole books. But wait, is there a way to maybe adjust the amounts for the other two projects to get more books? Let me check.\n\nIf I reduce the computer upgrade by $x, I can allocate that money to books. Similarly, reducing the children's area by $y could free up more money for books. But I have to make sure that the computer and children's area still meet their minimum requirements. So, the computer can't go below $400, and the children's area can't go below $250.\n\nLet me set up some variables. Let\u2019s say the library spends $400 on the computer and $250 on the children's area. That's the minimum. Then, the rest goes to books: $1,000 - $650 = $350. 350 divided by 15 is about 23.33, so 23 books.\n\nIf I try to reduce the computer or the children's area, but not below their minimums, can I get more books? For example, if I take an extra dollar from the computer and give it to the children's area, does that help? Well, it's just shifting money between the two, so the total allocated to books remains the same.\n\nWhat if I take some money from both? Let's say I take $10 from the computer and $10 from the children's area. Then, the computer would be $390, and the children's area would be $240. Both are still above their minimums. Now, the total allocated to books is $1,000 - $400 - $240 = $360. 360 / 15 = 24. So, that's one more book.\n\nWait, is that correct? If I take $10 from each, then the computer is $390 and the children's area is $240. So, the total spent on the two is $630, leaving $370 for books. 370 / 15 is approximately 24.666, so 24 books. That's better.\n\nBut can I go further? Let's try taking more from both. If I take $15 from the computer and $15 from the children's area, the computer becomes $385 and the children's area becomes $235. Both are still above their minimums. Now, the total spent on the two is $620, leaving $380 for books. 380 / 15 = 25.333, so 25 books.\n\nThat's even better. Can I take another $15 from each? Then, the computer would be $400 (minimum) and the children's area would be $210 (which is below the minimum of $250). So, that's not allowed because the children's area needs to be at least $250.\n\nSo, the maximum we can take from both is when the children's area is just at its minimum. Let me set the children's area to $250. Then, the computer can be reduced by $x, where $x is such that the total of the computer and children's area plus books equals $1,000.\n\nSo, let's say the children's area is $250. Then, the computer can be $400 - x, and the books would be $1,000 - 400 - x - 250 = $350 - x. We need to maximize the number of books, so we need to minimize x.\n\nBut x can't be less than 0 because we can't have negative money. So, the minimum x is 0, which means the computer is $400 and the children's area is $250, leaving $350 for books, which is 23.33, so 23 books.\n\nWait, that contradicts what I thought earlier. So, earlier when I took $15 from each, the children's area was still above $250, so that was allowed. But if I take more from the computer, I can take more from the children's area as long as it stays above $250.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this differently. Let me think about how much extra I can allocate to books by reducing the other two expenses.\n\nThe computer has a minimum of $400, so any extra beyond that can go to books. Similarly, the children's area has a minimum of $250, so any extra beyond that can also go to books.\n\nSo, let me define:\n\n- Minimum for computer: $400\n- Minimum for children's area: $250\n- Total budget: $1,000\n\nSo, the minimum combined for computer and children's area is $650. Therefore, the maximum amount left for books is $350, which is 23.33, so 23 books.\n\nBut earlier, I saw that if I take $15 from each, the children's area is $240, which is below the minimum. So, that's not allowed. Therefore, I can't take more than $0 from the children's area because that would make it go below $250.\n\nWait, no. If I take $15 from the computer, it goes to $385, which is above $400? No, wait, $400 is the minimum. So, if I take $15 from the computer, it goes to $385, which is below the minimum. So that's not allowed.\n\nWait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.\n\nThe computer must be at least $400, and the children's area must be at least $250. So, any money allocated to the computer must be >= $400, and any money allocated to the children's area must be >= $250.\n\nTherefore, the maximum I can take from the computer is $1,000 - $250 - $400 = $350, but that's not correct because the computer needs to be at least $400.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The total budget is $1,000. The computer must be at least $400, and the children's area must be at least $250. So, the minimum total for computer and children's area is $650. Therefore, the maximum amount left for books is $350, which is 23.33, so 23 books.\n\nBut earlier, I thought that by taking money from both, I could get more books. But that seems contradictory.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier reasoning. Let me try a different approach.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- Books: B\n- Computer: C\n- Children's area: K\n\nWe have:\n\nB + C + K = 1000\n\nWith constraints:\n\nC >= 400\n\nK >= 250\n\nWe need to maximize B.\n\nTo maximize B, we need to minimize C and K. So, set C = 400 and K = 250. Then, B = 1000 - 400 - 250 = 350. 350 /15 \u224823.33, so 23 books.\n\nIf we try to increase B by reducing C or K, but not below their minimums, we can't because C must be at least 400 and K must be at least 250. Therefore, the maximum B is 23.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that by taking money from both, I could get more books. Maybe I was wrong.\n\nWait, let me check with an example. Suppose we take $10 from C and $10 from K.\n\nSo, C = 400 -10 = 390 (which is above 400? No, 390 is less than 400, which violates the constraint. So, that's not allowed.\n\nTherefore, we can't take any money from C because that would make it below 400. Similarly, we can't take any money from K because that would make it below 250.\n\nWait, that can't be right because earlier I thought that taking $15 from each would still keep them above their minimums. Let me check.\n\nIf I take $15 from C, C becomes 400 -15=385, which is below 400. So, that's not allowed.\n\nSimilarly, taking $15 from K: 250-15=235, which is below 250. So, that's not allowed.\n\nTherefore, I cannot take any money from either C or K because that would violate their minimums. Therefore, the only way to maximize B is to set C=400 and K=250, leaving $350 for books, which gives 23 books.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that by taking $15 from each, I could get more books, but that would violate the minimums. So, perhaps my initial assumption was wrong, and the maximum is 23 books.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Suppose I take $x from C and $y from K, but ensure that C >=400 and K >=250.\n\nSo, C =400 +a, K=250 +b, where a and b are >=0.\n\nThen, B =1000 - (400 +a) - (250 +b) = 1000 -650 -a -b= 350 -a -b.\n\nTo maximize B, minimize a and b, which are >=0. So, the maximum B is when a=0 and b=0, giving B=350, which is 23.33, so 23 books.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of books they can buy is 23, and the allocation is $400 for computer, $250 for children's area, and $350 for books.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that taking money from both could give more books, but now I see that's not possible because it would violate the minimums.\n\nSo, the correct allocation is to spend $400 on computer, $250 on children's area, and $350 on books, buying 23 books.\n</think>\n\nThe library should allocate $400 to the computer system upgrade, $250 to the children's reading area, and the remaining $350 to purchasing new books. With $350, they can buy 23 new books.\n\nAllocation:\n- Computer system upgrade: $400\n- Children's reading area: $250\n- New books: $350 (23 books)\n\n**Answer:** The library should allocate $400 to the computer system, $250 to the children's area, and use the remaining $350 for 23 new books.

The goal is to maximize the number of new books they can purchase. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's outline the costs associated with each need:\n\n1. **New books**: Each new book costs $15.\n2. **Computer system upgrade**: This requires a minimum investment of $400.\n3. **Children's reading area**: Creating a functional area costs at least $250.\n\nThe total donation is $1,000, and the library wants to use this money to cover all three needs. However, they want to maximize the number of new books, which means I should try to allocate as much of the remaining money after covering the minimum costs of the other two needs to purchasing books.\n\nLet me denote the variables:\n\n- Let \\( B \\) be the number of new books they can purchase.\n- The cost for new books is \\( 15B \\).\n- The computer system upgrade has a minimum cost of $400.\n- The children's reading area has a minimum cost of $250.\n\nSo, the total allocation should satisfy the equation:\n\n\\[ 15B + 400 + 250 \\leq 1000 \\]\n\nSimplifying the left side:\n\n\\[ 15B + 650 \\leq 1000 \\]\n\nNow, subtract 650 from both sides to solve for \\( B \\):\n\n\\[ 15B \\leq 1000 - 650 \\]\n\\[ 15B \\leq 350 \\]\n\nDivide both sides by 15:\n\n\\[ B \\leq \\frac{350}{15} \\]\n\\[ B \\leq 23.\\overline{3} \\]\n\nSince the number of books must be a whole number, the maximum number of books they can purchase is 23.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total cost if they buy 23 books:\n\n\\[ 15 \\times 23 = 345 \\]\n\nAdding the minimum costs for the computer system and children's area:\n\n\\[ 345 + 400 + 250 = 995 \\]\n\nWait a minute, that's only $995, leaving a remaining balance of $5. The library might want to use that extra $5 to further enhance one of the areas, but since the goal is to maximize the number of books, they might prefer not to spend more on the other needs unless necessary. However, the problem doesn't specify whether they can exceed the minimum costs for the computer and children's areas. If they can, perhaps they can reallocate the remaining $5 to buy more books. Let's check.\n\nIf they have $5 left, they could use it to buy an additional book, but since each book costs $15, they can't buy another one with just $5. Therefore, the maximum number of books remains 23, and the remaining $5 can't be used for books. The library might choose to allocate it to other expenses, but since the main goal is books, 23 is the maximum.\n\nSo, the allocation would be:\n\n- 23 books: $345\n- Computer upgrade: $400\n- Children's area: $250\n- Total: $995\n- Remaining: $5 (could be used elsewhere if needed)\n\nTherefore, the library can buy 23 new books with the $1,000 donation.\n</think>\n\nThe library should allocate the funds as follows:\n\n- **New books**: 23 books at $15 each, costing $345.\n- **Computer system upgrade**: $400.\n- **Children's reading area**: $250.\n\n**Total allocation**: $345 + $400 + $250 = $995. The remaining $5 can be used for other purposes.\n\n**Number of new books they can buy**: 23.\n\nDONE."

The library wants to use this money to cover all three needs, but they want to buy as many new books as possible. So, I need to figure out how much money is left after covering the minimum costs of the computer system and the children's area. Whatever is left can then be used to buy books.\n\nLet me calculate the minimum required for the computer and children's area first.\n\n**Minimum for computer system**: $400\n\n**Minimum for children's area**: $250\n\nSo, adding those together: $400 + $250 = $650\n\nSubtracting that from the total donation: $1,000 - $650 = $350\n\nThis $350 can be used to buy new books. Since each book costs $15, I need to divide 350 by 15 to find out how many books they can purchase.\n\n$350 \u00f7 $15 = 23.333...\n\nBut you can't buy a third of a book, so they'll have to round down to the nearest whole number. That means they can buy 23 new books.\n\nWait, let me double-check that.\n\nIf they use $400 for the computer and $250 for the children's area, that's $650. Then $1,000 - $650 = $350 left for books. 350 divided by 15 is approximately 23.333, so yes, 23 books.\n\nIs there a better way to allocate the funds to get more books? Let me see.\n\nSuppose they reduce the amount allocated to one of the other needs to free up more money for books. For example, if they spend less on the computer system, they might have more for books, but the computer system requires a minimum of $400. They can't go below that because it's a minimum investment. Similarly, the children's area can't go below $250.\n\nAlternatively, if they increase the budget for one of the other areas beyond the minimum, that would mean they have less for books. But since the goal is to maximize books, we don't want to do that.\n\nAnother thought: What if they spend exactly the minimum on the computer and children's area, and then use the remaining for books? That seems to be the optimal approach because any additional money allocated to the other areas would reduce the number of books they can buy.\n\nSo, the allocation would be:\n\n- Computer system: $400\n- Children's area: $250\n- Books: $350\n\nBooks purchased: 350 / 15 = 23.333 \u2192 23 books.\n\nWait, but 23.333 is 23 and a third. Since you can't have a third of a book, it's 23 full books. So, 23 is the maximum number of books they can buy with the remaining $350.\n\nIs there a way to get 24 books? Let's see. 24 books would cost 24 * 15 = $360. But they only have $350 left after covering the other two needs. So, no, they can't afford 24 books because that would require an extra $10, which they don't have.\n\nTherefore, the optimal allocation is to spend $400 on the computer, $250 on the children's area, and $350 on books, allowing them to purchase 23 new books.\n\nI think that makes sense. They can't spend less than the minimum on the computer or the children's area without violating the problem's constraints. So, this allocation allows them to meet all three needs while maximizing the number of books they can buy.\n</think>\n\nThe library should allocate the $1,000 donation as follows:\n\n- **Computer system upgrade**: $400\n- **Children's reading area**: $250\n- **New books**: $350 (which allows purchasing 23 books)\n\n**Number of new books they can buy**: 23.\n\nDONE."
