  "question": "In the language of Verbia, there are four rules that determine how sentences are formed:\n1. All sentences begin with either 'kip' or 'mep'.\n2. If a sentence begins with 'kip', then it must end with 'tol'.\n3. If a sentence contains the word 'faz', then it must also contain the word 'rin'.\n4. The word 'rin' can only appear in sentences that begin with 'mep'.\n\nWhich of the following sentences is a valid sentence in Verbia?\nA. kip faz rin tol\nB. mep faz rin dom\nC. mep tol kip faz\nD. kip dom tol rin",
  "answer": "Step 1: Let's analyze each option according to the four rules.\n\nOption A: 'kip faz rin tol'\n- Begins with 'kip' \u2713 (Rule 1)\n- Ends with 'tol' \u2713 (Rule 2, since it begins with 'kip')\n- Contains 'faz' and also contains 'rin' \u2713 (Rule 3)\n- Contains 'rin' but begins with 'kip' \u2717 (Violates Rule 4, as 'rin' can only appear in sentences beginning with 'mep')\n\nOption B: 'mep faz rin dom'\n- Begins with 'mep' \u2713 (Rule 1)\n- No requirement to end with 'tol' \u2713 (Rule 2 only applies to sentences beginning with 'kip')\n- Contains 'faz' and also contains 'rin' \u2713 (Rule 3)\n- Contains 'rin' and begins with 'mep' \u2713 (Rule 4)\n\nOption C: 'mep tol kip faz'\n- Begins with 'mep' \u2713 (Rule 1)\n- No requirement to end with 'tol' \u2713 (Rule 2 only applies to sentences beginning with 'kip')\n- Contains 'faz' but does not contain 'rin' \u2717 (Violates Rule 3)\n- Does not contain 'rin' \u2713 (Rule 4 is not applicable)\n\nOption D: 'kip dom tol rin'\n- Begins with 'kip' \u2713 (Rule 1)\n- Ends with 'rin', not 'tol' \u2717 (Violates Rule 2)\n- Does not contain 'faz' \u2713 (Rule 3 is not applicable)\n- Contains 'rin' but begins with 'kip' \u2717 (Violates Rule 4)\n\nStep 2: The only option that satisfies all four rules is Option B: 'mep faz rin dom'. Therefore, B is the correct answer."
