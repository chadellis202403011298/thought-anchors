  "question": "A shape is placed on a 5\u00d75 grid, with the bottom-left corner of the grid being position (0,0) and the top-right corner being position (4,4). The shape consists of filled squares at positions (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), and (3,2). If this shape is reflected across the vertical line x=2 (which runs through the middle of the grid), what positions will be filled in the reflected shape?",
  "answer": "To solve this problem, I need to reflect each point across the vertical line x=2.\n\nWhen reflecting a point (x,y) across the vertical line x=2, the reflected point has coordinates (4-x,y). This is because the reflection transforms the x-coordinate to be the same distance from the line x=2, but on the opposite side, while keeping the y-coordinate unchanged.\n\nLet's reflect each of the filled squares:\n\n1. (1,1) reflected across x=2 becomes (4-1,1) = (3,1)\n2. (1,2) reflected across x=2 becomes (4-1,2) = (3,2)\n3. (2,1) reflected across x=2 becomes (4-2,1) = (2,1)\n4. (3,2) reflected across x=2 becomes (4-3,2) = (1,2)\n\nTherefore, after reflection, the filled squares will be at positions (3,1), (3,2), (2,1), and (1,2).\n\nNotice that (2,1) maps to itself, because it lies on the line of reflection. Also, (1,2) and (3,2) map to each other, creating a symmetric pattern."
