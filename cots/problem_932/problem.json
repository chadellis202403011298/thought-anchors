  "question": "A biologist is studying a newly discovered species of flowering plant. After observing many specimens, she notices that plants growing in shaded areas have larger leaves than those growing in sunny spots. Based on this observation, she formulates a hypothesis: 'The leaf size of this plant species is inversely related to sun exposure as an adaptation to maximize photosynthesis efficiency.' What is the next logical step in developing this scientific theory, and what specific prediction should the biologist make to test her hypothesis?",
  "answer": "The next logical step in developing this scientific theory is to design and conduct a controlled experiment to test the hypothesis.\n\nA specific prediction the biologist should make would be: 'If specimens of this plant species are grown under controlled conditions with different levels of light exposure but identical in all other environmental factors (soil, water, temperature), then the specimens receiving less light will develop larger leaves than those receiving more light.'\n\nThis prediction follows from the hypothesis and allows for empirical testing. By controlling all variables except light exposure, the biologist can determine if there is indeed a causal relationship between light levels and leaf size.\n\nThe experiment would establish whether the correlation observed in nature is maintained under controlled conditions, which is essential for developing a robust scientific theory. If the results support the prediction, it would strengthen the hypothesis, though additional tests would be needed to fully develop it into a theory (such as investigating the physiological mechanisms that cause larger leaf growth in response to shade).\n\nIf the results do not support the prediction, the biologist would need to revise or reject the hypothesis, which is also a valuable part of scientific theory development."
