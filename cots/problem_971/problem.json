  "question": "In a logic puzzle, three students (Amy, Ben, and Carla) each make one statement:\n\nAmy: 'If Ben is telling the truth, then Carla is lying.'\nBen: 'Either Amy is telling the truth or Carla is telling the truth, but not both.'\nCarla: 'Ben is lying.'\n\nIf exactly two of these students are telling the truth, who is lying?",
  "answer": "Let's assign variables to represent the truth values of each student's statement:\nA = Amy's statement is true\nB = Ben's statement is true\nC = Carla's statement is true\n\nWe need to determine which student is lying, given that exactly two students are telling the truth. This means that exactly one student is lying.\n\nNow, let's analyze each statement:\n\n1. Amy's statement: 'If Ben is telling the truth, then Carla is lying.'\n   This can be written as: B \u2192 \u00acC (If B is true, then C is false)\n   In propositional logic, this is equivalent to: \u00acB \u2228 \u00acC\n\n2. Ben's statement: 'Either Amy is telling the truth or Carla is telling the truth, but not both.'\n   This is an exclusive OR (XOR), which can be written as: (A \u2228 C) \u2227 \u00ac(A \u2227 C)\n   This simplifies to: (A \u2228 C) \u2227 (\u00acA \u2228 \u00acC)\n   Which further simplifies to: (A \u2227 \u00acC) \u2228 (\u00acA \u2227 C)\n\n3. Carla's statement: 'Ben is lying.'\n   This can be written as: \u00acB\n\nSince exactly two statements are true, we need to find the values of A, B, and C where exactly two of them are true and one is false.\n\nLet's examine each possibility:\n\nPossibility 1: A and B are true, C is false.\n   If A is true: B \u2192 \u00acC must be true. Since B is true and C is false, this statement is indeed true.\n   If B is true: (A \u2227 \u00acC) \u2228 (\u00acA \u2227 C) must be true. Since A is true and C is false, this becomes (true \u2227 true) \u2228 (false \u2227 false) = true \u2228 false = true.\n   If C is false: \u00acB must be false. Since B is true, \u00acB is false, so Carla's statement is indeed false.\n   This scenario works: all the logical implications are consistent.\n\nPossibility 2: A and C are true, B is false.\n   If A is true: B \u2192 \u00acC must be true. Since B is false, this implication is automatically true regardless of C.\n   If B is false: (A \u2227 \u00acC) \u2228 (\u00acA \u2227 C) must be false. With A true and C true, this becomes (true \u2227 false) \u2228 (false \u2227 true) = false \u2228 false = false.\n   If C is true: \u00acB must be true. Since B is false, \u00acB is true, so Carla's statement is true.\n   This scenario doesn't work because if B is false, then Ben's statement must be false, not true.\n\nPossibility 3: B and C are true, A is false.\n   If A is false: B \u2192 \u00acC must be false. Since B is true and C is true, B \u2192 \u00acC is false.\n   If B is true: (A \u2227 \u00acC) \u2228 (\u00acA \u2227 C) must be true. With A false and C true, this becomes (false \u2227 false) \u2228 (true \u2227 true) = false \u2228 true = true.\n   If C is true: \u00acB must be true. Since B is true, \u00acB is false, so Carla's statement is false.\n   This scenario doesn't work because if B and C are both true, then Amy's statement must be false and Carla's statement must also be false, which would mean only one statement is true.\n\nFrom analyzing these possibilities, we can see that only Possibility 1 works, where A and B are true, and C is false.\n\nTherefore, Carla is the one who is lying."
