  "question": "Physician is to Patient as Teacher is to ____________. Choose the most logically similar relationship: A) School B) Student C) Education D) Textbook",
  "answer": "The answer is B) Student.\n\nStep 1: Identify the relationship between the first pair of words (Physician and Patient).\nA physician provides professional services to a patient. The physician is the trained professional who delivers care, and the patient is the recipient of that care.\n\nStep 2: Look for the same type of relationship in the second pair.\nA teacher provides professional services to a student. The teacher is the trained professional who delivers education, and the student is the recipient of that education.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate each option:\nA) School - A teacher works at a school, but this doesn't mirror the physician-patient relationship.\nB) Student - This creates a parallel relationship where the teacher provides a service to the student, just as a physician provides a service to a patient.\nC) Education - This is what a teacher provides, similar to how a physician provides healthcare, but it doesn't represent the recipient of the service.\nD) Textbook - This is a tool used by a teacher, not the recipient of the teacher's service.\n\nTherefore, the most logical completion of the analogy is B) Student, as it maintains the professional service provider to service recipient relationship."
