  "question": "A school offers three languages: Spanish, French, and German. Among all students, 45% study Spanish, 35% study French, and 25% study German. Some students study multiple languages: 10% study both Spanish and French, 8% study both Spanish and German, and 7% study both French and German. Additionally, 3% of students study all three languages. If a student is randomly selected and you learn that they study Spanish, what is the probability that they also study French?",
  "answer": "This is a conditional probability problem where we need to find P(French | Spanish), which is the probability that a student studies French given that they study Spanish.\n\nTo solve this, we can use the formula for conditional probability:\nP(French | Spanish) = P(French \u2229 Spanish) / P(Spanish)\n\nWe know:\n- P(Spanish) = 0.45 (45% of students study Spanish)\n- P(French \u2229 Spanish) = 0.10 (10% of students study both Spanish and French)\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula:\nP(French | Spanish) = 0.10 / 0.45 = 2/9 \u2248 0.222 or about 22.2%\n\nTherefore, if we randomly select a student and learn they study Spanish, the probability that they also study French is 2/9 or approximately 22.2%.\n\nThis makes intuitive sense because out of all Spanish students (45% of the total), only a portion (10% of the total) also study French. The ratio of these two percentages gives us the conditional probability."
