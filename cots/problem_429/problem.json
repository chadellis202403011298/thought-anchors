  "question": "A university has the following policy for its philosophy course: 'If a student attends all lectures, then the student will pass the course.' Unfortunately, Jane attended all lectures but still failed the course. From this information alone, which of the following statements is correct?\n\nA) The university's policy is false.\nB) Jane must have failed to complete other requirements of the course.\nC) Attending all lectures is a necessary condition for passing the course.\nD) Attending all lectures is both necessary and sufficient for passing the course.",
  "answer": "The correct answer is A) The university's policy is false.\n\nLet's analyze this by examining necessary and sufficient conditions:\n\nThe university policy states: 'If a student attends all lectures, then the student will pass the course.'\n\nThis statement establishes attending all lectures as a sufficient condition for passing the course. In logical form, it says: 'Attending all lectures \u2192 Passing the course.'\n\nA sufficient condition means that if the condition is met, the result must follow. In this case, if a student attends all lectures (condition met), then passing the course (the result) must follow.\n\nHowever, we're told that Jane attended all lectures but failed the course. This directly contradicts the university's policy statement. Jane satisfied the sufficient condition (attended all lectures) but did not get the guaranteed result (passing the course).\n\nLet's check each option:\n\nA) The university's policy is false - Correct. The policy states that attending all lectures is sufficient for passing, but Jane's case demonstrates this isn't true.\n\nB) Jane must have failed to complete other requirements - This might be true in reality, but we can't conclude this from the information given. The policy only mentions lecture attendance as a sufficient condition for passing.\n\nC) Attending all lectures is a necessary condition - Incorrect. The policy establishes lecture attendance as a sufficient condition, not a necessary one. A necessary condition would be stated as: 'Only if a student attends all lectures will the student pass the course.'\n\nD) Attending all lectures is both necessary and sufficient - Incorrect. We've established it's not even sufficient based on Jane's case, so it cannot be both.\n\nTherefore, the only valid conclusion is that the university's policy statement is false."
