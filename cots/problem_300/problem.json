  "question": "Consider the analogy: 'Eagle is to Sky as Fish is to _____'. Choose the most logical option to complete this analogy and explain your reasoning.\nA) Water\nB) Ocean\nC) Swim\nD) Scale",
  "answer": "The answer is A) Water.\n\nStep 1: Identify the relationship between the first pair (Eagle and Sky).\nAn eagle is a creature that naturally inhabits and moves through the sky. The sky is the eagle's natural environment or medium.\n\nStep 2: Apply this relationship to the second pair (Fish and ?).\nFollowing the same relationship, a fish naturally inhabits and moves through water. Water is the fish's natural environment or medium.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate each option:\nA) Water - This represents the medium or environment where fish naturally live and move, just as the sky is for eagles. This maintains the same relationship.\nB) Ocean - While many fish live in oceans, this is too specific. Not all fish live in oceans (some live in rivers, lakes, etc.), just as not all eagles fly in all parts of the sky.\nC) Swim - This is an action fish perform, not their environment. This would change the relationship pattern from 'creature:environment' to 'creature:action'.\nD) Scale - This is a physical feature of most fish, not their environment. This would change the relationship pattern from 'creature:environment' to 'creature:physical attribute'.\n\nStep 4: Confirm the answer is A) Water, as it maintains the same 'creature:natural environment' relationship established in the first pair."
