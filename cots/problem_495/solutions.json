She has 10 tomato seedlings of the same variety that she planted on the same day. Design an experiment to test the effectiveness of the fertilizer, explaining what the control variables should be, what the experimental variable is, and how to set up a proper control group for comparison. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so the gardener wants to figure out if a new fertilizer helps tomatoes grow better. She has 10 seedlings, same variety, planted on the same day. That's a good setup because it controls for variables like planting time, soil type, etc.\n\nFirst, I need to think about what the main question is: does the fertilizer affect growth? So, the experiment should show a difference between the fertilizer group and the control group.\n\nWhat are the control variables here? Well, since all seedlings are from the same variety and planted on the same day, that already helps. But maybe I should make sure they're in the same environment. So, location in the garden should be the same for all. Also, watering\u2014probably the same amount and method, unless the fertilizer's effect is due to watering. But the fertilizer is the variable, so watering should be controlled. Maybe she uses the same watering can and water them equally.\n\nSo, the control variables are: type of plant (all tomatoes), planting date, location in garden, watering frequency and amount, soil preparation, maybe sunlight exposure if different areas get more sun.\n\nThe experimental variable is the fertilizer treatment. So, half the plants get the new fertilizer, and half don't. That way, any differences can be attributed to the fertilizer.\n\nSetting up the control group: these are the plants without the fertilizer. They should be treated the same as the experimental group except for the fertilizer. So, same watering, same soil, same care.\n\nWait, but maybe the gardener uses a different approach. Like, maybe she uses a randomized block design, where each plant is either treated or not, but that's similar. Or she could have two groups: one with fertilizer, one without. Then, measure growth after a set time, like a month or two.\n\nBut how do you measure growth? Maybe the height, number of leaves, number of fruits, weight. But since it's early, maybe just height and number of leaves. Or she could measure at the end of the season for the final yield.\n\nI think the key is to have a proper control group to compare against. So, the control group is the plants without the fertilizer, and the experimental group is the ones with it. Both groups get the same care otherwise.\n\nSo, in summary, the experiment involves dividing the 10 plants into two groups: one gets the fertilizer, the other doesn't. Control variables like planting time, location, watering, soil are kept the same. Then, after some time, compare growth between the two groups.\n</think>\n\nTo determine if the new fertilizer increases tomato plant growth, the gardener can design an experiment by dividing the 10 seedlings into two groups of 5 each. One group will receive the new fertilizer, and the other will serve as the control group without the fertilizer. Control variables such as planting date, location, watering frequency, and soil preparation will be kept consistent for both groups. After a set period (e.g., a month or the end of the growing season), the gardener will measure growth metrics like height, number of leaves, and yield to compare the two groups. This setup ensures that any observed differences can be attributed to the fertilizer.\n\nDONE."

Design an experiment to test the effectiveness of the fertilizer, explaining what the control variables should be, what the experimental variable is, and how to set up a proper control group for comparison. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to help the gardener figure out how to test if a new fertilizer helps her tomatoes grow more. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that in experiments, you need to have a control group and a treatment group. The control group is what you compare everything else to, right? So, the gardener has 10 tomato seedlings. Maybe she can split them into two groups: one as the control and the other as the treatment. \n\nWait, what should the control group do? They should just have the usual care, without the new fertilizer. That makes sense. So, the treatment group gets the new fertilizer, and the control group gets the regular fertilizer they usually use.\n\nBut what about the other variables? Like water, sunlight, nutrients besides the fertilizer. Those can affect growth. So, to make sure the experiment is fair, she should make sure that both groups have the same amount of water and sunlight. Maybe they should all be in the same type of soil too. Oh, and the timing is important\u2014planting them on the same day and at the same time, and checking their growth after the same period, like a couple of weeks later.\n\nSo, the experimental variable is the fertilizer. She'll give the treatment group the new fertilizer, and the control group gets the old one. Then, she can measure the growth by looking at height, number of leaves, and how many fruits they produce. That way, she can see if the new fertilizer is actually making the tomatoes grow better.\n\nI think that covers the main points. Control variables are water, sunlight, soil, planting time, and observation time. The experimental variable is the fertilizer type. The control group is the regular fertilizer group, and the treatment is the new fertilizer group.\n</think>\n\nThe gardener can conduct a controlled experiment by dividing the 10 tomato seedlings into two groups of five each. One group will receive the new fertilizer, while the control group will receive the regular fertilizer. Both groups will be kept in identical conditions regarding water, sunlight, and soil. After a set growth period, the gardener will measure growth by comparing the height, number of leaves, and fruit production between the two groups. \n\n**Control Variables:**\n- Water: Equal amount and frequency for both groups.\n- Sunlight: Same exposure time each day.\n- Soil: Identical type and preparation.\n- Planting Time: Same day and time for both groups.\n- Observation Period: Consistent time for growth measurement.\n\n**Experimental Variable:**\n- Fertilizer: New vs. regular.\n\n**Control Group:** Plants receiving the regular fertilizer.\n**Treatment Group:** Plants receiving the new fertilizer.\n\nAfter observing and measuring the growth, the gardener can determine if the new fertilizer significantly impacts tomato growth.\n\nDONE."

She has 10 seedlings from the same variety, planted on the same day. That's a good start because it means any differences should be due to the fertilizer, not other factors like different planting times or seed quality.\n\nFirst, I need to think about what variables are important here. The main thing is plant growth, so she should measure how tall each plant gets. Maybe she can take measurements every week or two to see the growth over time. But she also needs to control for other variables that could affect growth, like sunlight, water, and nutrients. \n\nSo, what can she control? She can make sure all the plants get the same amount of water and sunlight. Maybe put them all in the same garden bed and water them equally. That way, the only difference is the fertilizer.\n\nThe experimental variable is the fertilizer. She can test different dosages or types. Maybe she can use a regular fertilizer as a control and the new one at a different concentration. Or she could compare the new fertilizer with no fertilizer at all to see if it makes a difference.\n\nWait, but she only has 10 plants. If she uses a different fertilizer on some and the same on others, she can compare. Maybe divide them into groups: one group gets the new fertilizer, another gets the regular, and a third gets water only. But she might not have a third option. Alternatively, she can compare the new fertilizer against the regular one.\n\nAnother thought: maybe she should use a completely new, untreated group to see if the fertilizer has a significant effect. So, three groups: one with the new fertilizer, one with the regular, and one with no fertilizer. That way, she can see if the new one is better than both the regular and no treatment.\n\nBut she only has 10 plants. If she splits them into three groups, each group would have about 3 or 4 plants. That might work. She can measure each plant's height at the end of the growing season.\n\nWait, maybe she can also measure the number of tomatoes each plant produces. That's another good variable. It shows both growth in height and fruit production.\n\nSo, to summarize, the control variables should be water, sunlight, and maybe nutrients other than the fertilizer (like existing soil nutrients). She can control these by ensuring all plants get the same amount of water and sunlight, and maybe the same soil type.\n\nThe experimental variable is the fertilizer type or dosage. She can apply different treatments to different groups.\n\nFor the control group, she should have a group that doesn't receive the new fertilizer to compare against the treated groups. This will help determine if the new fertilizer actually makes a difference.\n\nSo, the setup would be: divide the 10 plants into three groups. One group gets the new fertilizer, another gets the regular fertilizer, and the third gets no fertilizer. Then, measure each plant's height and number of tomatoes at the end of the season.\n\nThis way, she can see if the new fertilizer outperforms both the regular and the no-fertilizer groups.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the effectiveness of the new fertilizer, the gardener can design an experiment with the following structure:\n\n**Control Variables:**\n- **Water:** Ensure all plants receive the same amount of water.\n- **Sunlight:** Provide equal sunlight exposure for all plants.\n- **Soil Type:** Use the same soil type for all seedlings to control for existing nutrients.\n\n**Experimental Variable:**\n- **Fertilizer:** Apply different treatments to test the effectiveness of the new fertilizer. This can be done by dividing the plants into groups:\n  - **Group 1:** Plants treated with the new fertilizer.\n  - **Group 2:** Plants treated with the regular fertilizer.\n  - **Group 3:** Plants not treated with any fertilizer (control group).\n\n**Procedure:**\n1. Divide the 10 tomato seedlings into three groups of approximately 3-4 plants each.\n2. Apply the respective fertilizers to the designated groups.\n3. Ensure all groups receive the same amount of water and sunlight.\n4. Measure the height of each plant and count the number of tomatoes produced at the end of the growing season.\n\n**Analysis:**\nCompare the growth and yield of the new fertilizer group against the regular and untreated groups. This will help determine if the new fertilizer significantly enhances growth and fruit production.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBy analyzing the data, the gardener can conclude whether the new fertilizer is more effective than the regular one or no fertilizer at all.\n\nDONE."

Design an experiment to test the effectiveness of the fertilizer, explaining what the control variables should be, what the experimental variable is, and how to set up a proper control group for comparison. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so the gardener wants to figure out if this new fertilizer is actually making her tomatoes grow better. She has 10 tomato seedlings, all the same variety, planted on the same day. That's a good start because it means any differences in growth should be due to the fertilizer, not other factors like different planting times or different types of plants.\n\nFirst, I need to think about what exactly she's testing. The main thing is comparing the new fertilizer against something else to see if it makes a difference. That something else is probably a control group. So, the experimental variable here is the fertilizer. She'll give some plants the new fertilizer and others a standard one, maybe the usual fertilizer she's been using.\n\nNow, what about the control variables? These are the things that shouldn't change between the groups to make sure any differences are because of the fertilizer. She needs to make sure that all plants are getting the same amount of sunlight, water, and care. Otherwise, if one group gets more attention, that could skew the results. So, she should monitor how much each plant is getting in terms of water, sunlight, and maybe even nutrients from the soil. If she uses pots, she can make sure each pot gets the same amount of soil and maybe the same size pot so that the growing conditions are as equal as possible.\n\nAnother thing is the timing. She plants them all on the same day, which is good, but she should make sure that the fertilizer is applied at the same time for each group. Maybe she can apply it once, say at planting time, and then again later, like at a certain interval, to see if it keeps working.\n\nSo, putting this together, she'll have two groups. One group gets the new fertilizer, and the other gets the standard one. She'll make sure both groups have the same growing conditions: same soil, same watering, same sunlight, same temperature, etc. Then she'll observe the plants over time. Maybe she'll measure their height, number of leaves, flowers, and the weight of the tomatoes when they ripen. That way, she can see if the new fertilizer is making the plants bigger, healthier, and more productive.\n\nWait, but she has 10 plants. Should she split them into two groups of 5? That makes sense because it's an even split, and she can compare the two groups effectively. Also, using a randomized approach might help ensure that the groups are similar in all aspects except for the fertilizer.\n\nI should also think about how to apply the fertilizer. She needs to make sure it's applied correctly\u2014maybe the same amount per plant in each group. And she should document everything, like when she applies the fertilizer, how much, and any other treatments the plants receive.\n\nIn the end, by comparing the two groups, she can see if the new fertilizer is effective. If the new fertilizer group has significantly more growth, then it's likely the fertilizer is helping. If not, then maybe it's not effective, or maybe the gardener needs to adjust how she's using it.\n\nI think that covers the main points. Control variables are the growing conditions, the experimental variable is the fertilizer, and the control group is the standard fertilizer group. By following this setup, she can get a clear comparison and determine if the new fertilizer works.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the effectiveness of the new fertilizer, the gardener can set up a controlled experiment with the following structure:\n\n1. **Control Variables**: Ensure all tomato seedlings receive the same amount of sunlight, water, and care. This includes consistent soil quality, pot size, and regular maintenance.\n\n2. **Experimental Variable**: Apply the new fertilizer to one group and a standard fertilizer to another group.\n\n3. **Control Group**: One group of 5 seedlings will be treated with the standard fertilizer.\n\n4. **Experimental Group**: The other group of 5 seedlings will be treated with the new fertilizer.\n\n5. **Observation and Measurement**: Monitor plant growth by measuring height, number of leaves, flowers, and tomato weight at ripening. Document fertilizer application details and plant treatments.\n\nBy comparing the two groups, the gardener can assess if the new fertilizer increases growth and productivity.\n\nDONE."

She has 10 seedlings, all the same variety, planted on the same day. That\u2019s a good start because it means the only difference between the plants should be the fertilizer treatment they get.\n\nFirst, I need to think about what variables are involved. The main thing she wants to measure is plant growth. But how exactly? She could measure the height, the number of tomatoes, or the weight of the tomatoes. Maybe all of these? It might be best to measure a few different aspects to get a comprehensive view.\n\nNext, the control variables. These are the things that shouldn\u2019t change between the groups to see if the fertilizer is the only factor affecting growth. So, the type of soil, water, sunlight, and maybe the support structure for the plants should all stay the same for each group. If these change, it might skew the results.\n\nThe experimental variable here is the fertilizer. She can use different concentrations or maybe different brands, but since it's a new fertilizer, maybe just the concentration. She could have a control group that gets no fertilizer or a standard fertilizer, and the test group gets the new one.\n\nSetting up the control group is important. The control group should have plants that are identical to the test group in every way except for the fertilizer. So, same soil, water, sunlight, etc. This way, any growth differences can be attributed to the fertilizer.\n\nFor the test group, they get the new fertilizer. She needs to apply it at the same time and in the same way as the control group to avoid any unintended variables.\n\nAfter setting everything up, she should measure the plants after a certain period, maybe a few weeks after planting. She can record the height, number of tomatoes, and maybe the weight. Then, compare the test group to the control group. If the test group is significantly larger, the fertilizer works.\n\nWait, but she has 10 plants. Should she split them into groups? Maybe 3 groups: two test groups with different concentrations and a control. Or maybe one test group and one control. But with 10, maybe two test groups and a control to see if both concentrations work.\n\nBut the question just asks to design an experiment, not necessarily how many groups. So maybe just a test group and a control. But to be thorough, perhaps using multiple test groups with different dosages could be better. But that might complicate things.\n\nI think the main points are identifying the control variables, defining the experimental variable, and setting up a proper control group. So, the key is making sure all other factors are the same except for the fertilizer. That way, the difference in growth can be solely attributed to the fertilizer.\n</think>\n\nThe gardener should design an experiment where she has two groups of tomato seedlings: one receiving the new fertilizer and the other as a control without the fertilizer. She will ensure that all control variables such as soil type, water, sunlight, and support structure are identical for both groups. She will measure growth by recording the height, number, and weight of the tomatoes after a set period. The control group will serve as a baseline to compare against the test group's growth, allowing her to determine if the fertilizer effectively increases plant growth.\n\nDONE."

She has 10 seedlings from the same variety, planted on the same day. That sounds like a good setup for a controlled experiment. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out what the independent variable is. That would be the fertilizer. She wants to see if the new fertilizer makes a difference, so she'll use it on one group and compare it to another group that doesn't get the fertilizer.\n\nNext, the dependent variable is the plant growth. She can measure this by how tall the plants get, how many leaves they have, or maybe the weight of the tomatoes when they ripen. It's important to choose a measurable outcome.\n\nControl variables are everything else that could affect the growth. Since all plants are the same variety and planted on the same day, things like sunlight, water, and nutrients from the soil should be the same for all. But maybe she should check the soil pH to make sure it's not a confounding factor.\n\nNow, setting up the experiment. She'll divide the 10 plants into two groups of 5. One group gets the new fertilizer, and the other doesn't. She should apply the fertilizer at the same time and same amount for each plant in the treatment group.\n\nMeasuring growth regularly is crucial. Maybe every week she can record the height or number of leaves. After a while, like a month or two, she can compare the treated plants to the control group.\n\nWait, should she also consider the type of fertilizer or the application method? If the fertilizer is new, maybe she should test different concentrations too. But to keep it simple, just using the new fertilizer versus no fertilizer might be enough for the first test.\n\nShe should also make sure that the control group doesn't get any extra treatment, so they grow naturally without any intervention.

So 5 plants get the fertilizer, and 5 don't. But wait, is 5 enough? Maybe more, but 10 is a manageable number. \n\nHow to measure growth? She could measure height every week. That's easy and shows growth over time. Alternatively, count the number of leaves or the weight of the tomatoes at harvest. But height seems simpler and can be measured regularly without too much effort.\n\nSo, the experimental variable is the fertilizer application. She should apply it at the same time, same amount, same method\u2014like mixing it into the soil at planting time. \n\nControl group: these plants shouldn't get the fertilizer.

The main thing is the fertilizer. So, the experimental variable here is the type of fertilizer used. She has a control group, which is the standard fertilizer, and the treatment group, which gets the new fertilizer. That makes sense.\n\nNow, what are the control variables? These are the things that should stay the same between the groups to ensure the experiment is fair. Since all the seedlings are the same variety and planted on the same day, that's a good start. She should make sure to water them equally, maybe fertilize the control group with the standard mix. She should also check the soil pH, because that can affect plant growth. If the pH is different, it might skew the results. So, testing and keeping the soil pH the same in both groups is important.\n\nWhat about the environment? The plants should be in the same type of soil, same sunlight, same temperature, and same watering schedule. Any difference here could influence growth without the fertilizer. So, controlling for these environmental factors is crucial.\n\nNext, how to set up the groups. She can randomly assign 5 seedlings to each group. That way, there's no bias, and it's fair. She'll apply the standard fertilizer to the control group and the new fertilizer to the treatment group. She should monitor the plants regularly, maybe weekly, to check for any signs of disease or pests, which could affect growth.\n\nAfter some time\u2014maybe a month or two, depending on the growth rate\u2014she'll measure the plants. She can look at the number of leaves, height, and the number of fruits. These are observable and measurable outcomes, which is good for data analysis.\n\nWait, but what if the new fertilizer has some unintended effects, like making the plants more susceptible to pests? That could complicate things. Maybe she should also check for pest presence or apply pesticides to both groups if necessary, but that might introduce another variable. Alternatively, she could just note any differences in health without intervention.\n\nAlso, she should make sure that after applying the fertilizer, she doesn't do anything else differently, like adding more water or adjusting the soil without intending to. That could mess up the results.\n\nSo, to sum up, the key is to keep all other variables the same, measure the outcomes accurately, and then compare the two groups. If the treatment group shows significantly more growth, the fertilizer is effective. If not, maybe it's not helpful or could even be harmful.\n\nI think that covers it. She needs to be meticulous in controlling for all other factors to get a clear result. Observing and measuring will give her the data she needs to make an informed decision.\n</think>\n\nThe gardener should design an experiment with the following structure to test the effectiveness of the new fertilizer:\n\n**Control Variables:**\n- **Plant Variety:** All tomato seedlings are of the same variety.\n- **Planting Date:** All seedlings are planted on the same day.\n- **Watering:** Equal watering for both groups.\n- **Soil Type:** Use the same type of soil for all seedlings.\n- **Sunlight and Temperature:** Ensure equal exposure to sunlight and same environmental temperature.\n- **Pest Control:** Apply pesticides or monitor for pests equally in both groups.\n- **Soil pH:** Maintain the same soil pH level for both groups.\n\n**Experimental Variable:**\n- **Fertilizer Type:** Compare a control group with the standard fertilizer to a treatment group with the new fertilizer.\n\n**Group Setup:**\n- **Random Assignment:** Assign 5 seedlings to each group randomly to eliminate bias.\n- **Fertilization:** Apply the standard fertilizer to the control group and the new fertilizer to the treatment group.\n- **Monitoring:** Regularly check plant health, noting any signs of disease or pests.\n\n**Outcome Measurement:**\n- **Leaf Count:** Measure the number of leaves on each plant.\n- **Height:** Record the height of each plant.\n- **Fruit Count:** Count the number of fruits produced.\n\n**Analysis:**\nCompare the growth metrics of the treatment group to the control group.

She has a control group, which is the standard fertilizer, and the treatment group gets the new one.\n\nBut wait, what about the control variables? Those are the things that shouldn't change between the groups. Like, the soil type should be the same for all plants. If she changes the soil, that could affect growth regardless of the fertilizer. So, all plants should be in the same soil.\n\nAlso, sunlight, water, and temperature are important for plants. She needs to make sure all seedlings get the same amount of sunlight, watered equally, and kept at the same temperature. Otherwise, any differences in those could mess up the results.\n\nNow, how to set up the control group. She has 10 plants. Maybe divide them into two groups of 5. One group gets the new fertilizer, the other gets the regular one. That way, any differences can be measured between the two.\n\nFor measuring growth, she could record the height and number of leaves at the start and after a certain time, like a month. That way, she can see if the new fertilizer made them grow more.\n\nWait, should she randomize which plants get which fertilizer? Yeah, that makes sense. Otherwise, she might accidentally give the better plants to one group without knowing.\n\nAlso, she should use identical pots or planters for all, same size, same drainage. That way, the only difference is the fertilizer.\n\nSo, in summary, the control variables are soil, water, sunlight, and temperature. The experimental variable is the fertilizer type. Control group uses regular fertilizer, and the treatment group gets the new one. She measures growth after some time, like a month, and compares the two groups.\n</think>\n\nThe gardener should design an experiment with two groups of 5 tomato seedlings each. Both groups will be planted in identical pots in the same soil, exposed to the same sunlight, watered equally, and maintained at the same temperature. One group will receive the new fertilizer, while the control group will receive the standard fertilizer. Growth will be measured by recording the height and number of leaves after a month. This setup ensures that only the fertilizer is the variable, providing clear data on its effectiveness.\n\nDONE."

    "solution": "Solve this problem step by step. End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: A gardener wants to determine if a new fertilizer increases tomato plant growth. She has 10 tomato seedlings of the same variety that she planted on the same day. Design an experiment to test the effectiveness of the fertilizer, explaining what the control variables should be, what the experimental variable is, and how to set up a proper control group for comparison. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so the gardener wants to test if a new fertilizer increases tomato plant growth. She has 10 tomato seedlings, same variety, planted on the same day. Hmm, okay, so I need to design an experiment to see if the fertilizer makes a difference.\n\nFirst, I should think about what the independent variable is here. That's the fertilizer, right? So she'll be using the new fertilizer in one group and maybe a control group with water or regular fertilizer.\n\nNow, what about the dependent variable? That's what she's measuring, like the growth of the plants. She might measure height, number of leaves, or weight of the tomatoes. Probably height is easiest to measure.\n\nControl variables are the things she needs to keep the same for both groups. So, things like sunlight, water, nutrients except the fertilizer, temperature, and soil type. She needs to make sure these are the same for all plants to avoid any confounding factors.\n\nSetting up the experiment: She has 10 plants. Maybe divide them into two groups of five. One group gets the new fertilizer, the other gets water or a regular fertilizer as a control. She needs to apply the fertilizer at the same time, same amount, same method\u2014like spraying or watering equally.\n\nWait, but she only has 10 plants. So maybe one group gets the new fertilizer, and the other gets a standard fertilizer as a control. Or perhaps a third group without any additional fertilizer to see the base growth.\n\nBut since she wants to compare the new fertilizer to something else, maybe a control group with water. So Group 1: New Fertilizer, Group 2: Water. Then measure growth over time.\n\nShe should also randomize the planting positions to avoid any unintended effects from location, like different sunlight exposure.\n\nAfter a few weeks, she'll measure the height or weight of the tomatoes. If the new fertilizer group grows significantly taller or has more tomatoes, then it's effective.\n\nWait, but what if the control group is just water? Maybe she should also have a group with a standard fertilizer to compare. Or maybe just compare the new fertilizer to no fertilizer. Hmm, but the original question says she wants to test against a control, which is usually a standard treatment.\n\nI think the key points are identifying the variables, controlling for other factors, setting up equal groups, and measuring the outcome. So, she needs to ensure all plants have the same conditions except for the fertilizer, and then measure growth.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the effectiveness of the new fertilizer, the experiment should be designed as follows:\n\n1. **Independent Variable (Fertilizer Treatment):** \n   - Two groups of tomato plants will receive different fertilizer treatments.\n   - Group 1: New Fertilizer.\n   - Group 2: Control (Water or Standard Fertilizer).\n\n2. **Dependent Variable (Growth Measurement):**\n   - Measure growth in terms of height, number of leaves, and weight of tomatoes at regular intervals (e.g., every two weeks).\n\n3. **Control Variables:**\n   - Ensure all plants have the same sunlight exposure, watering frequency, temperature, and soil type.\n   - Randomize plant positions to avoid location-based confounding factors.\n\n4. **Experimental Setup:**\n   - Divide the 10 seedlings into two groups of five.\n   - Apply the new fertilizer to one group and a standard fertilizer or water to the other.\n   - Monitor growth over time, taking measurements at the same time intervals for each group.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Compare the growth metrics of both groups. If the new fertilizer group shows significantly greater growth, it is deemed effective.\n\nDONE."
