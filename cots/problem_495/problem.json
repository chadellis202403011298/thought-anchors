  "question": "A gardener wants to determine if a new fertilizer increases tomato plant growth. She has 10 tomato seedlings of the same variety that she planted on the same day. Design an experiment to test the effectiveness of the fertilizer, explaining what the control variables should be, what the experimental variable is, and how to set up a proper control group for comparison.",
  "answer": "To design this experiment properly, I need to identify control variables, the experimental variable, and establish a proper control group.\n\n1. Experimental (Independent) Variable:\n   - The fertilizer application (presence vs. absence of the new fertilizer)\n\n2. Control Variables (variables to keep constant):\n   - Plant variety (already controlled as all plants are the same variety)\n   - Age of plants (already controlled as all were planted on the same day)\n   - Amount of water each plant receives (must be kept identical)\n   - Sunlight exposure (all plants should receive the same amount of sunlight)\n   - Soil type and amount (use the same soil mixture and amount for all plants)\n   - Container size (use identical containers)\n   - Temperature and environmental conditions (keep all plants in the same location)\n   - Timing and frequency of care (water all plants on the same schedule)\n\n3. Experiment Design:\n   - Divide the 10 seedlings randomly into two groups of 5 plants each\n   - Group A: Apply the new fertilizer according to recommended instructions\n   - Group B: Control group - Do not apply the new fertilizer\n   - Keep all other variables constant between the two groups\n   - Measure plant growth (height, number of leaves, or other relevant metrics) at regular intervals\n   \n4. Dependent Variable (what to measure):\n   - Plant growth (height in centimeters, number of leaves, fruit production, etc.)\n\nBy ensuring all variables except the fertilizer application remain constant, any significant difference in growth between the two groups can be reasonably attributed to the effect of the fertilizer."
