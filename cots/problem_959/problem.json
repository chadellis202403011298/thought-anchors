  "question": "A man lives on the 10th floor of an apartment building. Every morning, he takes the elevator down to the ground floor to go to work. When he returns in the evening, he takes the elevator to the 7th floor and then walks up the stairs for the remaining three floors to his apartment. However, on rainy days, he takes the elevator all the way to the 10th floor. Why does he do this?",
  "answer": "The man is of short stature (he is quite short). In the elevator, he can only reach the button for the 7th floor with his umbrella. On rainy days, he has his umbrella with him, so he can use it to press the 10th-floor button. On non-rainy days, he doesn't have his umbrella, so he can only reach and press the button for the 7th floor and must walk up the remaining floors.\n\nThis problem requires lateral thinking because the conventional assumption would be to consider factors like exercise preferences, elevator mechanics, or social interactions. The key insight comes from abandoning these conventional paths and considering the unusual connection between rainy days and the ability to reach higher buttons - the umbrella serves a dual purpose beyond just keeping one dry."
