Which one of their statements describes a scientifically falsifiable claim?\n\nA) Maria: 'Plants grow toward light because they have an inherent spiritual connection to the sun's energy.'\n\nB) Alex: 'Plants grow toward light because they contain a hormone called auxin that accumulates on the shaded side, causing cells there to elongate more than on the light-exposed side.'\n\nC) Jamal: 'Plants grow toward light because it is their purpose in nature to seek illumination.'\n\nD) Lisa: 'Plants grow toward light because that's just what plants have always done throughout history.' \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out which of these four statements is a scientifically falsifiable claim. Let's break it down step by step. \n\nFirst, what does \"falsifiable\" mean? From what I remember, a falsifiable claim is one that can potentially be proven false with evidence. In other words, it's a statement that isn't absolute or untestable. If a claim can be tested and found to be incorrect, then it's falsifiable.\n\nNow, let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A: Maria says, \"Plants grow toward light because they have an inherent spiritual connection to the sun's energy.\" Hmm, this sounds more like a philosophical or religious statement rather than a scientific one. It's suggesting a non-material, spiritual reason. In science, explanations are usually based on physical or chemical processes. I don't think this is a falsifiable claim because it's more about belief than something that can be tested scientifically. If someone were to say, \"Plants grow toward light because of a specific hormone,\" that's something you could test with experiments. But Maria's statement is more abstract and not tied to observable mechanisms.\n\nOption B: Alex states, \"Plants grow toward light because they contain a hormone called auxin that accumulates on the shaded side, causing cells there to elongate more than on the light-exposed side.\" This seems like a scientific explanation. Auxin is a real hormone in plants, and it's known to affect growth, especially in response to light. This is a specific, testable claim. If we could show that auxin doesn't cause this elongation, then Alex's claim would be falsified. So, this is definitely falsifiable.\n\nOption C: Jamal claims, \"Plants grow toward light because it is their purpose in nature to seek illumination.\" Similar to Maria's statement, this sounds more like a teleological argument, suggesting that plants have a purpose or intention. It's more of a philosophical or religious viewpoint rather than a scientific explanation. Like Maria's statement, it's not based on observable mechanisms and is more about why something exists rather than how it works. So, this isn't falsifiable in a scientific sense.\n\nOption D: Lisa says, \"Plants grow toward light because that's just what plants have always done throughout history.\" This is a bit tricky. On one hand, it's a general statement about plant behavior over time. However, it's not making a specific claim about the mechanism, like the auxin theory. It's more of a descriptive statement about historical behavior. But can this be falsified? If we found a plant species that doesn't grow toward light, then Lisa's claim would be falsified. However, it's a bit vague because it's making a claim about all plants throughout history, which might not be entirely testable in the same way as Alex's specific claim. Still, it's somewhat falsifiable because it's making a universal statement that can be tested with counterexamples.\n\nNow, comparing all four options, Maria and Jamal are making more philosophical or spiritual claims that aren't based on scientific mechanisms, so they aren't falsifiable. Alex's claim is specific about the hormone auxin, which is a well-established scientific concept, making it easily falsifiable. Lisa's claim is a bit more ambiguous, but it's still making a general statement that can potentially be tested, so it's also falsifiable.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the statement that \"describes a scientifically falsifiable claim.\" Since Alex's statement directly refers to a specific biological mechanism (auxin), it's the most clearly falsifiable. Lisa's claim is also falsifiable, but it's less direct and more about historical behavior, which might be harder to test definitively.\n\nSo, after considering all options, Alex's statement is the most scientifically falsifiable because it provides a specific, testable mechanism for why plants grow toward light.\n</think>\n\nThe statement by Alex is scientifically falsifiable because it refers to the auxin hormone, a specific, testable mechanism. \n\n**Answer: B) Alex**\n\nDONE."

The question is asking which statement is a scientifically falsifiable claim. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to remember what a falsifiable claim is. From what I recall, a falsifiable claim is one that can potentially be proven false through scientific experimentation or observation. In other words, it's a statement that isn't so absolute that it can't be tested or disproven. On the other hand, a universal, untestable claim might be more of a belief or a non-scientific statement.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA) Maria says, \"Plants grow toward light because they have an inherent spiritual connection to the sun's energy.\" Okay, so this is talking about a spiritual or metaphysical reason. That feels more like a belief rather than a scientific explanation. I don't think this can be tested scientifically because it's more about a non-tangible connection. So, this might not be falsifiable.\n\nB) Alex states, \"Plants grow toward light because they contain a hormone called auxin that accumulates on the shaded side, causing cells there to elongate more than on the light-exposed side.\" This is a specific, scientific explanation involving a chemical process. I remember learning about auxin in plant biology, where it's involved in growth responses. This is something that can be tested. For example, if we manipulate the auxin levels in plants, we could see if the growth pattern changes. So, this seems falsifiable because it's a testable claim.\n\nC) Jamal says, \"Plants grow toward light because it is their purpose in nature to seek illumination.\" This sounds similar to Maria's statement but framed differently. It's about a purpose or intention, which again seems more like a belief rather than a scientific explanation. It's not something that can be tested or disproven through scientific methods. So, this isn't falsifiable.\n\nD) Lisa claims, \"Plants grow toward light because that's just what plants have always done throughout history.\" This is a bit tricky. It's making a general statement about plant behavior over a long time period. While it's a broad claim, it's not exactly something that can be easily tested. It's more of a historical observation without a specific mechanism. However, if we could find a plant species that doesn't grow toward light, that would falsify her claim. But since it's about \"what plants have always done,\" it's more of a universal statement. Still, it's slightly more testable than A and C because it's a specific behavior, but not as directly as B.\n\nComparing all these, Alex's statement in option B is the most scientific and directly falsifiable. Maria's and Jamal's are more philosophical or spiritual, which aren't scientific claims. Lisa's is more of a historical or universal statement, which is also not falsifiable in the same way.\n\nSo, the answer should be B.\n</think>\n\nThe statement that is scientifically falsifiable is Alex's explanation about auxin. \n\nAlex: 'Plants grow toward light because they contain a hormone called auxin that accumulates on the shaded side, causing cells there to elongate more than on the light-exposed side.'\n\n**Answer:** B) Alex: 'Plants grow toward light because they contain a hormone called auxin that accumulates on the shaded side, causing cells there to elongate more than on the light-exposed side.'\n\nDONE."

Let me start by understanding what falsifiable means. From what I remember, a falsifiable statement is one that can potentially be proven wrong through scientific experimentation or evidence. In other words, it should be possible to design an experiment that could disprove it.\n\nLet's look at each option one by one.\n\n**Option A: Maria says plants grow toward light because of a spiritual connection.**  \nMaria's statement is about a spiritual or inherent connection. This seems more like a philosophical or religious explanation rather than a scientific one. I don't recall any scientific evidence supporting that plants have spiritual reasons for growing towards light. This seems more like a belief rather than a hypothesis that can be tested. If someone were to try to disprove this, they might look for evidence of plants growing towards light without any spiritual connection, but I don't think this is a common approach in science. It's more of a personal belief.\n\n**Option B: Alex mentions auxin accumulation.**  \nAlex's statement talks about auxin, which I know is a hormone in plants. I've heard that auxin accumulates on the shaded side, causing cells there to elongate more, making the plant grow towards light. This sounds like a specific, testable scientific claim. For example, experiments could manipulate auxin levels or observe the effect of shading on different plant parts to see if this claim holds. If auxin is indeed the reason, then this can be confirmed or falsified through experiments. So this seems falsifiable.\n\n**Option C: Jamal's statement is about plants seeking illumination as their purpose.**  \nSimilar to Maria, Jamal is attributing plant behavior to a higher purpose or intention. This is more of a teleological explanation, which is about purpose rather than mechanism. Like Maria's statement, it's more of a philosophical take. It's not a specific, testable claim. There's no clear mechanism or hypothesis here, so it's hard to see how this could be falsified through scientific means.\n\n**Option D: Lisa says plants have always grown towards light historically.**  \nLisa's statement is more about the historical behavior of plants rather than a specific explanation. It could be interpreted as a descriptive statement about observed behavior rather than a causal explanation. However, it's a bit vague. If someone were to test this, they'd need to look into historical records and see if plants have consistently grown towards light over time. But this seems more about correlation than causation, and it's not a specific claim that can be easily tested or disproven in a laboratory setting.\n\nComparing all these, Alex's statement about auxin is the most specific and testable. It provides a mechanism (auxin accumulation) and can be directly tested through experiments. The others either lack a specific mechanism or are more philosophical, making them harder to falsify scientifically.\n\nSo, the answer should be Alex's statement.\n</think>\n\nThe statement that describes a scientifically falsifiable claim is Alex's explanation involving auxin. This is because it provides a specific, testable hypothesis that can be disproven through scientific experimentation.\n\n**Answer: B) Alex: 'Plants grow toward light because they contain a hormone called auxin that accumulates on the shaded side, causing cells there to elongate more than on the light-exposed side.'**\n\nDONE."

Okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, what does \"scientifically falsifiable\" mean? From what I remember, a falsifiable claim is one that can be proven false with evidence. If a statement can't be disproven, it's not falsifiable. So, I need to look for a statement that makes a claim that could potentially be tested and found to be incorrect.\n\nLet's look at the options one by one.\n\nOption A: Maria says, \"Plants grow toward light because they have an inherent spiritual connection to the sun's energy.\" Hmm, this seems more like a philosophical or religious statement. It's suggesting that plants have some sort of spiritual reason for growing towards light. But I don't think this is something that can be tested scientifically. Spiritual connections aren't really something that can be measured or proven false. So, maybe this isn't falsifiable.\n\nOption B: Alex claims, \"Plants grow toward light because they contain a hormone called auxin that accumulates on the shaded side, causing cells there to elongate more than on the light-exposed side.\" Okay, auxin is a real hormone in plants, and I remember from biology class that when plants are exposed to light, auxin distribution changes, affecting growth. This is a well-established scientific explanation. So, this statement is based on observable, testable mechanisms. Therefore, it's falsifiable because if we found a plant that didn't show this auxin accumulation or growth pattern, we could disprove Alex's claim.\n\nOption C: Jamal says, \"Plants grow toward light because it is their purpose in nature to seek illumination.\" This sounds similar to Maria's statement. It's more of a teleological argument, implying that plants have a purpose or intention. Again, this isn't something that can be tested scientifically. Purpose isn't something that can be measured or disproven. So, this isn't falsifiable either.\n\nOption D: Lisa states, \"Plants grow toward light because that's just what plants have always done throughout history.\" This is a bit vague. It suggests that this behavior is a historical practice, but it's not providing a specific mechanism or cause. It's more of a descriptive statement rather than an explanatory one. However, if we could show that plants don't always grow towards light, or if there are plants that don't follow this pattern, then this claim could be falsified. But I'm not sure if this is as directly falsifiable as Alex's statement.\n\nComparing all the options, Alex's statement is clearly based on a scientific mechanism (auxin) that can be tested and potentially disproven. The others are either philosophical, teleological, or too vague to be falsifiable.\n\nSo, I think the correct answer is B.\n</think>\n\nThe statement by Alex is scientifically falsifiable because it is based on a known biological mechanism involving auxin, which can be tested and disproven.\n\nDONE."

Let's break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, what does it mean for a statement to be falsifiable? From what I remember, a falsifiable hypothesis is one that can potentially be proven false if it doesn't hold up under scientific testing. It's different from a statement that's universally accepted as true without any possibility of disproof.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA) Maria says plants grow toward light because of a spiritual connection. This seems more like a philosophical or religious statement rather than a scientific explanation. It doesn't provide any mechanism or process that can be tested scientifically. If someone were to say plants have a spiritual reason, that's more of a belief than something that can be proven or disproven through scientific methods. So, this might not be falsifiable.\n\nB) Alex mentions auxin, a hormone that accumulates on the shaded side, causing cells to elongate more there. This is a specific biological mechanism. Auxin's role in plant growth is something that can be studied and tested. For example, scientists can manipulate the levels of auxin in plants and observe the effect on growth direction. If increasing auxin in the shaded side doesn't cause plants to grow more there, then Alex's claim would be falsified. So, this statement is definitely falsifiable.\n\nC) Jamal states that plants grow toward light because it's their purpose in nature. This sounds like a teleological argument, suggesting an inherent purpose or intention in nature. While this is a common way people think about nature, it's more of a philosophical perspective rather than a scientific explanation. There's no specific mechanism or process provided, so it's hard to see how this could be tested scientifically. Therefore, it might not be falsifiable.\n\nD) Lisa claims plants have always grown toward light throughout history. This is a historical statement, implying that this behavior is a long-standing fact. However, it doesn't provide a scientific explanation. Even if historical records show plants growing toward light, this doesn't explain why it happens. To test this, you'd need to see if plants would still grow toward light if the reason (like auxin) were altered. But more importantly, Lisa's statement is more about observation rather than a testable hypothesis. It doesn't offer a mechanism that can be disproven. So, it might not be falsifiable either.\n\nComparing all options, only Alex's statement (B) provides a specific, testable mechanism (auxin accumulation) that can be scientifically investigated and disproven if necessary. The other options either lack a scientific mechanism or are more philosophical in nature, making them non-falsifiable.\n</think>\n\nThe statement by Alex (B) is scientifically falsifiable because it provides a specific mechanism involving auxin that can be tested and proven or disproven through scientific experiments.\n\nDONE."

I need to figure out which statement is scientifically falsifiable. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what a falsifiable claim is. From what I remember, a falsifiable hypothesis is one that can potentially be proven wrong with evidence. In other words, it's a statement that, if not true, could lead to contradictions or inconsistencies in observations. Non-falsifiable claims, on the other hand, are usually statements that can't be disproven because they're vague or rely on untestable concepts.\n\nNow, let's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A: Maria says plants grow toward light because of a spiritual connection. Hmm, this seems more philosophical. She's attributing the behavior to some inherent spiritual reason. I'm not sure how this can be tested scientifically. Spiritual connections aren't something we can measure or observe in a lab. So, maybe this is a non-falsifiable claim because it's more about a belief rather than a scientific explanation.\n\nOption B: Alex mentions auxin, a hormone that accumulates on the shaded side. I've heard of auxin before; it's related to plant growth. If you have more auxin on the shaded side, the cells there elongate more, pulling the plant toward the light. This is a specific, testable claim. If we can show that auxin levels increase in the shade, and that this causes cell elongation, then Alex's statement could be proven or falsified. So this seems like a falsifiable claim.\n\nOption C: Jamal talks about plants seeking illumination as their purpose. This sounds similar to Maria's statement but phrased differently. It's about plants having a purpose in nature. Like the first option, this is more of a teleological explanation. Teleology is about purposes or goals, which aren't really things we can test scientifically. So, Jamal's statement is probably non-falsifiable.\n\nOption D: Lisa says plants have always grown toward light throughout history. This is more of a historical claim. It suggests that this behavior is a long-standing fact. However, if we can find a plant that doesn't grow toward light, or if we can show that this behavior isn't universal, then her claim could be falsified. But wait, is it really a testable statement? It's more about general observation. Maybe it's not as falsifiable as Alex's claim because it's more of a descriptive statement rather than a causal explanation.\n\nComparing all four, Maria and Jamal are making statements about spiritual or teleological reasons, which aren't falsifiable. Lisa's statement is descriptive but might not be as directly falsifiable as Alex's. Alex's claim is specific about the role of auxin, which we can test with experiments. So, Alex's statement is the most falsifiable.\n</think>\n\nThe statement that is scientifically falsifiable is Alex's explanation about auxin accumulation causing plants to grow toward light. This can be tested through experiments to measure auxin levels and their effect on cell elongation.\n\n**Answer: B) Alex: 'Plants grow toward light because they contain a hormone called auxin that accumulates on the shaded side, causing cells there to elongate more than on the light-exposed side.'**\n\nDONE."

It's suggesting a non-material, spiritual reason for the behavior. Scientific explanations are usually based on physical or chemical mechanisms, so this is more of a metaphysical claim.

Therefore, it's not falsifiable.\n\n**Option B: Alex's Statement**\nAlex claims, \"Plants grow toward light because they contain a hormone called auxin that accumulates on the shaded side, causing cells there to elongate more than on the light-exposed side.\" This is a specific, testable claim. It references auxin, which is a known hormone in plants. Auxin distribution has been studied extensively, and experiments have shown that it causes growth on the shaded side. This is a falsifiable claim because if we were to alter the auxin levels or manipulate its distribution, we could observe whether the growth pattern changes accordingly.\n\n**Option C: Jamal's Statement**\nJamal states, \"Plants grow toward light because it is their purpose in nature to seek illumination.\" Similar to Maria's statement, this is more of a teleological argument, suggesting that plants have a purpose or intention. This kind of statement isn't based on empirical evidence and can't be disproven through scientific means. It's more of a philosophical perspective rather than a scientific explanation.\n\n**Option D: Lisa's Statement**\nLisa says, \"Plants grow toward light because that's just what plants have always done throughout history.\" This is a bit tricky. It sounds like it's suggesting that this behavior is a historical fact, but it's phrased in a way that implies it's always been the case. However, it's more of a descriptive statement rather than a testable claim. While it's not directly falsifiable, it's more about describing an observed phenomenon rather than proposing a mechanism or cause.\n\nComparing all these, Alex's statement is the only one that provides a specific, measurable mechanism (auxin hormone) that can be tested and potentially disproven. Maria's and Jamal's statements are more about metaphysical reasons, which aren't falsifiable. Lisa's statement is descriptive but doesn't offer a mechanism, making it less falsifiable.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be Alex's statement.\n</think>\n\nThe statement that describes a scientifically falsifiable claim is Alex's explanation about the auxin hormone.

The question is asking which of their statements describes a scientifically falsifiable claim. Let me break this down step by step to figure it out.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a falsifiable claim is. From what I remember, a falsifiable claim is one that can potentially be proven false with evidence. This means it should be possible to design an experiment or gather data that contradicts the claim. If a statement can't be tested or disproven, then it's not falsifiable.\n\nNow, let's look at each option one by one.\n\n**Option A: Maria says, \"Plants grow toward light because they have an inherent spiritual connection to the sun's energy.\"**\n\nHmm, Maria is talking about a spiritual connection. This seems more like a philosophical or religious statement rather than a scientific explanation. I don't think this is a testable claim because it's more about beliefs rather than something we can measure scientifically. There's no way to test if plants have a spiritual connection to the sun. So, this might not be falsifiable.\n\n**Option B: Alex states, \"Plants grow toward light because they contain a hormone called auxin that accumulates on the shaded side, causing cells there to elongate more than on the light-exposed side.\"**\n\nOkay, Alex is giving a scientific explanation involving auxin, a hormone I've heard about before. Auxin's role in plant growth, specifically in causing cells to elongate on the shaded side, is something that has been studied and proven. This seems like a falsifiable claim because it's a specific mechanism that can be tested. For example, if we block the auxin transport or remove auxin, we can see if the growth toward light still occurs. If it doesn't, the claim is falsified.\n\n**Option C: Jamal says, \"Plants grow toward light because it is their purpose in nature to seek illumination.\"**\n\nSimilar to Maria, Jamal is making a statement that sounds more like a purpose or intention, which again is more philosophical. Plants don't have intentions or purposes; they respond to stimuli like light through mechanisms like phototropism. This kind of statement isn't something that can be tested scientifically because it's about why something happens, not how it happens. So, this isn't falsifiable either.\n\n**Option D: Lisa claims, \"Plants grow toward light because that's just what plants have always done throughout history.\"**\n\nLisa is referring to historical behavior of plants. This seems like a statement based on observation over time rather than a specific mechanism. However, it's a bit vague. If we consider it, it's more about the consistent behavior of plants rather than a specific cause. It's not as direct as Alex's statement about auxin. Still, it's possible to test whether plants growing toward light is an inherent behavior or if it's due to some other factor. But I'm not sure if it's as falsifiable as Alex's explanation.\n\nComparing all four options, Maria and Jamal are making statements that are more about intentions or spiritual connections, which aren't falsifiable. Lisa's statement is about historical behavior, which could be tested but isn't as precise. Alex, on the other hand, provides a specific, testable mechanism involving auxin. Therefore, Alex's statement is the most falsifiable because it's a concrete, verifiable claim.\n\nSo, after thinking through each option and considering what makes a claim falsifiable, I believe the correct answer is Alex's statement.\n</think>\n\nThe statement by Alex is the most scientifically falsifiable because it provides a specific, testable mechanism involving auxin. Maria and Jamal's statements are philosophical, while Lisa's is about historical behavior, making them less falsifiable. \n\n**Answer: B) Alex: 'Plants grow toward light because they contain a hormone called auxin that accumulates on the shaded side, causing cells there to elongate more than on the light-exposed side.'**\n\nDONE."

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what a falsifiable claim is. From what I remember, a falsifiable hypothesis is one that can potentially be proven wrong through scientific experimentation or observation. It has to be something that, if certain conditions aren't met, can lead to the hypothesis being rejected. In other words, it's not something that's universally true or impossible to disprove.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA) Maria says plants grow toward light because of a spiritual connection. Hmm, this sounds more like a philosophical or religious statement. It's about a deeper, non-scientific reason. I don't think this is a scientific claim at all, so it might not be falsifiable in the scientific sense.\n\nB) Alex mentions a hormone called auxin accumulating on the shaded side, causing elongation. I recall from biology that auxin does play a role in plant growth, specifically in the direction of light. So this seems like a scientific explanation. It's a specific, testable claim. If we can manipulate auxin levels or observe its distribution, we could test this hypothesis.\n\nC) Jamal talks about plants seeking illumination as their purpose. This sounds similar to Maria's statement, more of a teleological argument. It's about purpose, which isn't really a scientific explanation. It's more of a philosophical or religious viewpoint, so again, not a scientific claim.\n\nD) Lisa says plants have always grown toward light throughout history. This is a bit tricky. It's making a general statement about how plants behave over a long time. But in reality, plants don't all grow toward light in the same way. Some might have adapted differently over time. Also, the statement doesn't provide a mechanism or a testable hypothesis. It's more of a descriptive statement about observed behavior, which might not be falsifiable because it's more about an observed trend rather than a specific explanation.\n\nSo, comparing the options, Maria and Jamal are making non-scientific, spiritual or teleological claims, which aren't falsifiable. Lisa's statement is more descriptive and might not be easily falsifiable either. Alex, on the other hand, is providing a specific, scientific explanation involving a known biological mechanism (auxin), which can be tested through experiments.\n\nTherefore, the statement that describes a scientifically falsifiable claim is Alex's.\n</think>\n\nThe statement that is scientifically falsifiable is Alex's explanation about auxin accumulation. \n\nAlex: 'Plants grow toward light because they contain a hormone called auxin that accumulates on the shaded side, causing cells there to elongate more than on the light-exposed side.'\n\n**Answer:** Alex's statement is scientifically falsifiable.\n\nDONE."

First, I need to understand what a falsifiable claim is. From what I remember, a falsifiable claim is one that can potentially be proven false with evidence or experimentation. In other words, it's a statement that isn't absolute or universal\u2014it's something that, if evidence contradicts it, we can conclude the claim is wrong.\n\nLet's look at each option one by one.\n\nOption A: Maria says, \"Plants grow toward light because they have an inherent spiritual connection to the sun's energy.\" This seems more like a philosophical or religious statement. It's suggesting that plants are motivated by a spiritual reason. I don't think this is a scientific claim because it's not something that can be tested or disproven through scientific methods. It's more of a belief or opinion rather than something based on evidence.\n\nOption B: Alex states, \"Plants grow toward light because they contain a hormone called auxin that accumulates on the shaded side, causing cells there to elongate more than on the light-exposed side.\" This sounds like a scientific explanation. Auxin is a real hormone in plants that does affect growth. If we can test this by manipulating auxin levels or observing the growth patterns when auxin is present or absent, we can verify if this claim is true. So, this is a falsifiable claim because it's based on a specific biological mechanism that can be studied.\n\nOption C: Jamal claims, \"Plants grow toward light because it is their purpose in nature to seek illumination.\" Similar to Maria's statement, this is more of a teleological argument\u2014implying that plants have a purpose or intention. It's a philosophical statement rather than a scientific one. There's no scientific basis to suggest that plants have a purpose to seek light; they simply respond to light due to their biological makeup.\n\nOption D: Lisa says, \"Plants grow toward light because that's just what plants have always done throughout history.\" This statement is a bit vague. It's suggesting that plants have always grown toward light due to some historical reason. However, without specific evidence or a mechanism to explain why this happens, it's hard to test this claim. It's more of a general statement about plant behavior rather than a specific, testable hypothesis.\n\nComparing all four, Maria's and Jamal's statements are philosophical and not based on scientific evidence, making them unfalsifiable. Lisa's statement is too vague to be falsifiable without more specifics. However, Alex's explanation about auxin is a scientific claim that can be tested through experiments, making it falsifiable.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be Alex's statement because it's a scientific claim that can be proven or disproven with evidence.\n</think>\n\nThe statement that is scientifically falsifiable is Alex's explanation about auxin. \n\n**Answer: B) Alex**\n\nDONE."
