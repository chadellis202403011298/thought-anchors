  "question": "A small toy company needs to design a new educational toy for children ages 6-8. Using Morphological Analysis, they've identified four key parameters: Material (Wood, Plastic, Fabric), Educational Focus (Math, Language, Science), Interaction Type (Individual, Collaborative, Parent-Child), and Complexity Level (Simple, Moderate). If the company wants to create a toy that uses sustainable materials, focuses on scientific concepts, can be used by multiple children together, and has a straightforward design, which specific combination of parameter values should they select? Explain why this combination best fits their criteria.",
  "answer": "To solve this problem using Morphological Analysis, I need to match each of the company's criteria to the appropriate parameter values.\n\nLet's analyze each criterion:\n\n1. \"Sustainable materials\" - Among the Material options (Wood, Plastic, Fabric), wood is generally considered the most sustainable natural material, as it is renewable and biodegradable compared to plastic. Fabric could also be sustainable depending on the source, but wood is the clearest match.\n\n2. \"Focuses on scientific concepts\" - This directly corresponds to the Educational Focus parameter, where Science is one of the options (alongside Math and Language).\n\n3. \"Can be used by multiple children together\" - This maps to the Interaction Type parameter, and the \"Collaborative\" option specifically indicates use by multiple children together.\n\n4. \"Straightforward design\" - This relates to the Complexity Level parameter, where \"Simple\" would be the most straightforward option.\n\nTherefore, the optimal combination is:\n- Material: Wood\n- Educational Focus: Science\n- Interaction Type: Collaborative\n- Complexity Level: Simple\n\nThis combination directly satisfies all the stated criteria while utilizing the Morphological Analysis framework to systematically explore the design parameters and their possible values."
