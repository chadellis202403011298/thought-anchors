  "question": "A hospital is considering two different medications (Drug A and Drug B) for treating a certain condition. Clinical trials have shown that Drug A is effective in 80% of patients but causes mild side effects in 30% of those who take it. Drug B is effective in 70% of patients and causes mild side effects in 20% of those who take it. If the hospital values both effectiveness and minimal side effects equally, which drug should they choose to minimize overall risk to patients?",
  "answer": "To solve this problem, we need to assess the overall risk associated with each drug by considering both their effectiveness and side effect profiles.\n\n1. First, let's clarify what constitutes a risk in this scenario:\n   - Ineffectiveness is a risk (the drug doesn't work)\n   - Side effects are a risk\n\n2. For Drug A:\n   - Probability of ineffectiveness = 1 - 0.80 = 0.20 or 20%\n   - Probability of side effects = 0.30 or 30%\n   - Since the hospital values both factors equally, we can add these risks:\n   - Total risk for Drug A = 0.20 + 0.30 = 0.50 or 50%\n\n3. For Drug B:\n   - Probability of ineffectiveness = 1 - 0.70 = 0.30 or 30%\n   - Probability of side effects = 0.20 or 20%\n   - Total risk for Drug B = 0.30 + 0.20 = 0.50 or 50%\n\n4. Comparing the overall risks:\n   - Drug A: 50% risk\n   - Drug B: 50% risk\n\n5. Since both drugs have the same overall risk assessment (50%), the hospital could choose either drug. However, they might consider other factors such as cost, specific patient profiles, or the severity of side effects (which wasn't specified in the problem) to make a final decision. Based purely on the information given and the equal weighting of risks, there is no clear advantage to either medication."
