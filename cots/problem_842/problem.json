  "answer": "The correct answer is B.\n\nWhen we fold a square piece of paper along its vertical midline and look at it from behind, we're essentially creating a reflection of the original image across the vertical axis.\n\nIn a reflection across a vertical line:\n1. Points that were on the right side move to the left side, and vice versa\n2. The distance from any point to the line of symmetry remains the same after reflection\n3. The top-to-bottom orientation remains unchanged\n\nStep-by-step analysis:\n- The original 'F' has its vertical line on the left side and its horizontal elements extending to the right\n- When reflected across a vertical line, the vertical line of the 'F' will appear on the right side\n- The horizontal elements will extend to the left from this vertical line\n\nLooking at option B:\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n     \u2588\n   \u2588\u2588\u2588\n     \u2588\n     \u2588\n\nThis shows the letter 'F' with its vertical line on the right and horizontal elements extending to the left, which is exactly what we would see when looking at our folded paper from behind. The vertical bar is now on the right side, and the horizontal segments extend leftward from it.\n\nTherefore, B is the correct answer."
