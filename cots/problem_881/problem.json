  "question": "A professor made the following statement: 'All of the students who studied consistently passed my course.' Based on this statement, which of the following conclusions must be true?\n\n1. Students who did not study consistently failed the course.\n2. Students who passed the course studied consistently.\n3. Some students who studied consistently failed the course.\n4. Some students who did not study consistently passed the course.",
  "answer": "The correct answer is 2: Students who passed the course studied consistently.\n\nStep 1: Let's analyze the original statement: 'All of the students who studied consistently passed my course.' This can be rewritten as 'If a student studied consistently, then the student passed the course.'\n\nStep 2: For option 1, 'Students who did not study consistently failed the course.' This is not necessarily true. The original statement doesn't tell us anything directly about students who didn't study consistently. They might have passed or failed - we simply don't know.\n\nStep 3: For option 2, 'Students who passed the course studied consistently.' This is logically equivalent to the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of 'If studied consistently, then passed' is 'If not passed, then not studied consistently,' which is logically equivalent to 'If passed, then studied consistently.' Therefore, this must be true.\n\nStep 4: For option 3, 'Some students who studied consistently failed the course.' This directly contradicts the original statement, which says ALL students who studied consistently passed. So this cannot be true.\n\nStep 5: For option 4, 'Some students who did not study consistently passed the course.' As with option 1, the original statement doesn't provide information about students who didn't study consistently, so we cannot determine if this is true or false.\n\nTherefore, only option 2 must be true based on the professor's statement."
