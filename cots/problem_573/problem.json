  "question": "A researcher wants to study the effect of a new fertilizer on tomato plant growth. She sets up 20 tomato plants in identical pots with the same soil. She applies the new fertilizer to 10 of the plants and uses a standard fertilizer on the other 10 plants. All plants receive the same amount of water and sunlight. After 30 days, she measures the height of each plant. What key elements of the scientific method are demonstrated in this experiment, and what is the independent variable, dependent variable, and control group in this study?",
  "answer": "This experiment demonstrates several key elements of the scientific method:\n\n1. Hypothesis testing: The researcher is implicitly testing a hypothesis that the new fertilizer affects tomato plant growth compared to standard fertilizer.\n\n2. Controlled experimentation: The researcher is keeping all variables constant except for the type of fertilizer used.\n\n3. Quantitative measurement: Plant height provides a measurable outcome to compare the effects.\n\n4. Use of sample groups: Multiple plants are used in each condition to account for natural variation.\n\nThe variables in this experiment are:\n\n- Independent variable: The type of fertilizer (new fertilizer vs. standard fertilizer). This is the variable the researcher is manipulating.\n\n- Dependent variable: The height of the tomato plants after 30 days. This is what is being measured to determine the effect of the independent variable.\n\n- Control group: The 10 plants receiving the standard fertilizer serve as the control group. These provide a baseline for comparison to determine if the new fertilizer produces different results.\n\nThis experimental design follows good scientific practice by controlling for potential confounding variables (same pots, soil, water, sunlight) and using multiple samples in each group to reduce the influence of random variation."
