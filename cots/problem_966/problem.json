  "question": "A researcher wants to test whether a new fertilizer increases tomato plant growth compared to a standard fertilizer. She has 40 tomato seedlings of the same variety available for the experiment. Describe the most appropriate experimental design for this study, including how to address potential confounding variables. What would be the independent and dependent variables in this experiment?",
  "answer": "The most appropriate experimental design would be a controlled experiment with two groups:\n\n1. Control Group: 20 tomato seedlings treated with the standard fertilizer\n2. Experimental Group: 20 tomato seedlings treated with the new fertilizer\n\nTo address potential confounding variables:\n\n- Random assignment: Randomly assign seedlings to either the control or experimental group to distribute any natural variations in plant vigor evenly between groups\n- Standardize conditions: Ensure both groups receive the same amount of water, sunlight, temperature, and other environmental conditions\n- Use identical containers with the same soil type and quantity\n- Plant all seedlings at the same time\n- Measure all plants using the same method and schedule\n\nVariables:\n- Independent variable: Type of fertilizer (standard vs. new)\n- Dependent variable: Tomato plant growth (could be measured by height, number of leaves, stem diameter, or total biomass at the end of the experiment)\n\nBy controlling for all other variables and only changing the fertilizer type, any significant differences in growth between the two groups can be reasonably attributed to the effect of the fertilizer being tested."
