  "question": "Sarah is in her office on the 10th floor when she realizes she needs to get an important document to her colleague on the ground floor immediately. The elevator is out of order, and running down the stairs would take too long. She notices the following items on her desk: a ream of paper, paper clips, a stapler, several folders, a rubber band, and a small, empty cardboard box. There's an open window nearby with a clear drop to an open area where her colleague is waiting. How can she get the document to her colleague quickly using only these items?",
  "answer": "Sarah is experiencing functional fixedness if she only considers the conventional uses of the objects at her disposal. To solve this problem, she needs to think beyond the normal functions of these items.\n\nThe solution is to make a paper airplane with the document. \n\nStep 1: Recognize that the document itself can be transformed into a delivery mechanism, rather than focusing on the other items as containers or attachments.\n\nStep 2: Fold the document into a paper airplane. The paper airplane can carry itself through the air from the window to the ground floor.\n\nStep 3: If the document is multiple pages, she could use a paper clip or stapler to keep the pages together before folding them.\n\nStep 4: She could also add weight to the nose of the plane using a paper clip to improve its flight trajectory.\n\nStep 5: Sarah can then launch the paper airplane from her window down to her colleague waiting below.\n\nThis solution overcomes functional fixedness by reimagining the document not just as information to be delivered, but as the delivery vehicle itself. The key insight is recognizing that paper has properties beyond holding information - it can be folded to create an aerodynamic object capable of flight."
