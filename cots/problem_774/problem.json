  "question": "A research team wants to estimate the average height of adult residents in a city of 100,000 people. They decide to use systematic sampling by selecting every 500th person from an alphabetized list of residents. They measure the heights of these 200 people and find the average to be 172 cm with a standard deviation of 8 cm. However, the team is concerned about potential bias in their sampling method. Specifically, they worry that choosing people alphabetically might somehow correlate with certain ethnic groups that could have different average heights. What sampling method would be more appropriate for this situation, and why? Additionally, calculate the margin of error for their current sample at a 95% confidence level.",
  "answer": "To address the sampling method question, a simple random sample would be more appropriate than the systematic sampling from an alphabetized list. Here's why:\n\n1. Simple random sampling would give every individual in the population an equal chance of being selected, which helps eliminate potential biases.\n\n2. The concern about alphabetical ordering potentially correlating with ethnic groups is valid. Certain surnames are more common in specific ethnic groups, which could lead to over or under-representation if these ethnic groups have different average heights.\n\n3. A simple random sample could be implemented by assigning each resident a unique number from 1 to 100,000 and then using a random number generator to select 200 individuals.\n\nNow, let's calculate the margin of error for their current sample at a 95% confidence level:\n\nFormula for margin of error = z \u00d7 (\u03c3/\u221an), where:\n- z = 1.96 for 95% confidence level\n- \u03c3 = standard deviation = 8 cm\n- n = sample size = 200\n\nMargin of error = 1.96 \u00d7 (8/\u221a200)\n                = 1.96 \u00d7 (8/14.14)\n                = 1.96 \u00d7 0.566\n                = 1.11 cm\n\nTherefore, with the current sample, the research team can estimate that the true average height of the city's population is 172 \u00b1 1.11 cm with 95% confidence. However, this assumes their sampling method doesn't introduce bias, which is a concern they've correctly identified."
