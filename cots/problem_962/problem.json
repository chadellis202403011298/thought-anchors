  "question": "A pharmaceutical company is developing a new medication. Based on preliminary trials, they estimate the medication has an 80% chance of being effective and a 15% chance of causing minor side effects. Assuming that effectiveness and side effects are independent events, answer the following questions:\n\n1. What is the probability that the medication will be both effective and cause no side effects?\n2. What is the probability that the medication will either be ineffective or cause side effects (or both)?\n3. If the company decides to market the medication, what is the probability that a patient will have a completely positive experience (effective treatment with no side effects)?",
  "answer": "To solve this problem, we need to apply basic probability principles for independent events.\n\nGiven information:\n- Probability of effectiveness (E) = 0.80 or 80%\n- Probability of minor side effects (S) = 0.15 or 15%\n- The events are independent\n\n1. Probability that the medication will be both effective and cause no side effects:\n   - Probability of no side effects = 1 - P(S) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85 or 85%\n   - Since the events are independent, we multiply: P(E and no S) = P(E) \u00d7 P(no S) = 0.80 \u00d7 0.85 = 0.68 or 68%\n\n2. Probability that the medication will either be ineffective or cause side effects (or both):\n   - This is the complement of the medication being both effective and causing no side effects\n   - P(ineffective or side effects) = 1 - P(effective and no side effects) = 1 - 0.68 = 0.32 or 32%\n\n3. Probability that a patient will have a completely positive experience:\n   - A completely positive experience means the medication is effective and causes no side effects\n   - This is the same as the answer to question 1: P(positive experience) = 0.68 or 68%\n\nTherefore, there is a 68% chance that a patient will have a completely positive experience with this medication."
