  "question": "In a debate about implementing a new city park, a council member states: 'We should reject this park proposal. After all, this proposal was created by Council Member Johnson, and everyone knows that Johnson is just trying to win votes for the upcoming election.' What logical fallacy is demonstrated in the council member's argument?",
  "answer": "The council member's argument demonstrates the ad hominem fallacy.\n\nStep 1: Identify the structure of the argument.\nThe council member argues that the park proposal should be rejected because Council Member Johnson (who created it) has ulterior motives related to winning votes.\n\nStep 2: Analyze what makes this reasoning flawed.\nInstead of addressing the actual merits of the park proposal itself (such as costs, benefits, location, etc.), the council member attacks the character and motives of the person who proposed it.\n\nStep 3: Identify the specific fallacy.\nThis is an ad hominem fallacy (Latin for 'to the person'). An ad hominem fallacy occurs when someone attacks the person making an argument rather than addressing the argument's substance. The personal motives of Council Member Johnson might be questionable, but this doesn't automatically make the park proposal itself bad or unworthy.\n\nStep 4: Confirm the answer.\nEven if Johnson is indeed motivated by gaining votes, this fact alone doesn't determine whether the park would benefit the city. The proposal should be evaluated on its own merits regardless of who proposed it or why."
