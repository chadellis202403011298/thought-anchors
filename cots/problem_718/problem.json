  "question": "Consider the following statement: 'All dogs that don't bark are not good guard dogs.' Which of the following statements is logically equivalent to this statement?\n\nA) If a dog is a good guard dog, then it barks.\nB) If a dog barks, then it is a good guard dog.\nC) All good guard dogs are dogs that bark.\nD) No dogs that bark are good guard dogs.",
  "answer": "Let's analyze this statement by breaking it down into logical form:\n\n'All dogs that don't bark are not good guard dogs.'\n\nStep 1: Identify the logical structure.\nLet's denote:\n- D: the dog barks\n- G: the dog is a good guard dog\n\nThe original statement says: All dogs that don't bark are not good guard dogs.\nIn logical form: If (not D), then (not G).\nThis can be written as: \u00acD \u2192 \u00acG\n\nStep 2: Apply logical equivalence rules.\nUsing contraposition, we know that (P \u2192 Q) is logically equivalent to (\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP).\nSo, \u00acD \u2192 \u00acG is logically equivalent to G \u2192 D.\n\nStep 3: Translate this back into English.\nG \u2192 D means: 'If a dog is a good guard dog, then it barks.'\n\nStep 4: Check each option.\nA) 'If a dog is a good guard dog, then it barks.' This is G \u2192 D, which we showed is equivalent to our original statement.\nB) 'If a dog barks, then it is a good guard dog.' This is D \u2192 G, which is not equivalent to our original statement.\nC) 'All good guard dogs are dogs that bark.' This is the same as 'If a dog is a good guard dog, then it barks' (G \u2192 D), which is equivalent to our original statement.\nD) 'No dogs that bark are good guard dogs.' This would be D \u2192 \u00acG, which is not equivalent to our original statement.\n\nBoth options A and C express the same logical relationship (G \u2192 D), which is equivalent to our original statement. However, since we need to choose one answer, option A 'If a dog is a good guard dog, then it barks' is the direct contrapositive of the original statement, making it the best answer."
