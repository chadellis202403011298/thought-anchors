  "question": "A small educational startup needs to design a classroom layout with limited resources. They have 20 identical square tables, each seating one student per side. The principal wants to maximize the number of students who can be seated while ensuring that all students can see the teacher at the front of the room. Additionally, there must be clear walking paths for the teacher to reach any student. How many different valid arrangements can you generate, and what is the maximum number of students that can be accommodated in the best arrangement?",
  "answer": "This problem requires divergent thinking to explore multiple possible solutions.\n\nStep 1: Let's consider what makes a valid arrangement:\n- All 20 tables must be used\n- Students must be able to see the front (not seated with their backs to the teacher)\n- Clear paths must exist for teacher movement\n- Each table side can seat one student\n\nStep 2: Explore possible arrangements:\n\nArrangement 1: Traditional rows\n- 5 rows of 4 tables each\n- Students seated on 3 sides of each table (excluding the back side)\n- Maximum students: 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 = 60 students\n- Pros: Orderly, clear sightlines\n- Cons: Not space-efficient\n\nArrangement 2: U-shaped arrangement\n- Outer U: 14 tables (5+4+5) in U-shape\n- Inner U: 6 tables (2+2+2) forming smaller U inside\n- Students seated on sides facing the center/front\n- Maximum students: 14 \u00d7 2 + 6 \u00d7 2 = 40 students\n- Pros: Good visibility, collaborative\n- Cons: Fewer students than other arrangements\n\nArrangement 3: Herringbone pattern\n- 4 rows of 5 tables at 45\u00b0 angles\n- Students seated on 3 sides (excluding the back)\n- Maximum students: 4 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 3 = 60 students\n- Pros: Good visibility, efficient use of space\n- Cons: Slightly more complex to set up\n\nArrangement 4: Modified pods\n- 5 pods of 4 tables each\n- Tables arranged in square with small gaps between them\n- Students seated on outer sides of each pod (3 students per table)\n- Maximum students: 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 = 60 students\n- Pros: Collaborative, maintains sightlines\n- Cons: Teacher may need to move more to reach all students\n\nArrangement 5: Paired tables in rows\n- 10 pairs of tables forming 5 rows\n- Students seated on all sides except those facing away from the front\n- Maximum students: 10 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3 = 60 students\n- Pros: Balance of structure and space efficiency\n- Cons: Middle students may have partially obstructed views\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the maximum capacity:\nThe maximum number of students that can be accommodated is 60, which can be achieved in arrangements 1, 3, 4, and 5.\n\nTherefore, we have generated 5 different valid arrangements, with the maximum student capacity being 60 students."
