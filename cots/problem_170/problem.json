  "answer": "To prove that \\( \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} = 2^n \\), I'll use a combinatorial argument.\n\nStep 1: Understand what each side represents:\n- The left side, \\( \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} \\), represents the sum of all possible ways to choose k elements from a set of n elements, where k ranges from 0 to n.\n- The right side, \\( 2^n \\), represents the total number of subsets of a set with n elements.\n\nStep 2: Combinatorial interpretation:\n- Consider a set S with n elements: S = {1, 2, 3, ..., n}\n- For each element in S, we have two choices: either include it in a subset or exclude it.\n- With n elements and 2 choices for each, we have \\( 2^n \\) different possible subsets in total.\n\nStep 3: Alternative counting method:\n- We can also count the subsets by their size:\n  * \\( \\binom{n}{0} \\) = number of subsets with 0 elements (just the empty set)\n  * \\( \\binom{n}{1} \\) = number of subsets with 1 element\n  * \\( \\binom{n}{2} \\) = number of subsets with 2 elements\n  ...\n  * \\( \\binom{n}{n} \\) = number of subsets with n elements (just the complete set)\n\nStep 4: Conclusion:\n- Since both \\( \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} \\) and \\( 2^n \\) count the same thing (the total number of subsets of an n-element set), they must be equal.\n- Therefore, \\( \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} = 2^n \\).\n\nThis proof illustrates a fundamental principle in combinatorial mathematics: counting the same set in two different ways leads to an identity."
