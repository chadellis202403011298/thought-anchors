  "question": "A small town has three autonomous delivery robots (A, B, and C) that deliver packages to residents. Each robot can carry up to 5 packages at once and has a battery that lasts for 3 hours before needing to be recharged (which takes 1 hour). The town receives 30 packages per day that need to be delivered, and each delivery takes 10 minutes on average. If all three robots operate optimally as a system, what is the minimum number of hours required to deliver all packages in a day?",
  "answer": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze how the three robots can work together as a system to deliver all packages efficiently.\n\n1. First, let's calculate the total delivery time needed:\n   - 30 packages \u00d7 10 minutes per delivery = 300 minutes = 5 hours of total delivery time\n\n2. Since we have 3 robots, they could potentially complete the deliveries in 5 \u00f7 3 = 1.67 hours if they could all work continuously.\n\n3. However, we need to consider the battery constraints:\n   - Each robot can work for 3 hours before needing a 1-hour recharge\n   - All robots can deliver packages simultaneously\n\n4. Let's analyze how many packages each robot can deliver in one battery cycle:\n   - Each delivery takes 10 minutes\n   - With a 3-hour battery life, each robot can make (3 hours \u00d7 60 minutes/hour) \u00f7 10 minutes = 18 deliveries per battery cycle\n   - However, each robot can only carry 5 packages at once, meaning they would need to return to the depot to reload after every 5 deliveries\n   - For simplicity, we'll assume the time to reload is negligible compared to delivery time\n\n5. With 3 robots, they can deliver 3 \u00d7 18 = 54 packages per battery cycle, which exceeds our requirement of 30 packages\n\n6. Therefore, the robots can complete all deliveries within one battery cycle\n\n7. The minimum time required is the time to distribute the 30 deliveries among the 3 robots:\n   - If distributed evenly, each robot would handle 10 packages\n   - 10 packages \u00d7 10 minutes = 100 minutes = 1.67 hours\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of hours required to deliver all packages in a day is 1.67 hours (or 1 hour and 40 minutes)."
