Calculate the following set expressions and explain your reasoning step by step:\n\n1. (A \u2229 B) \u222a (A \u2229 C)\n2. A \u2229 (B \u222a C)\n3. Determine whether the expressions in parts 1 and 2 are equal, and if they are, explain why this equality holds in general.",
  "answer": "Step 1: Calculate (A \u2229 B) \u222a (A \u2229 C)\n\nFirst, find A \u2229 B:\nA = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\nB = {2, 4, 6, 8}\nA \u2229 B = {2, 4} (elements that appear in both A and B)\n\nNext, find A \u2229 C:\nA = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\nC = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}\nA \u2229 C = {1, 3, 5} (elements that appear in both A and C)\n\nFinally, find the union of these two intersections:\n(A \u2229 B) \u222a (A \u2229 C) = {2, 4} \u222a {1, 3, 5} = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n\nStep 2: Calculate A \u2229 (B \u222a C)\n\nFirst, find B \u222a C:\nB = {2, 4, 6, 8}\nC = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}\nB \u222a C = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} (elements that appear in either B or C)\n\nNext, find the intersection of A with this union:\nA = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\nB \u222a C = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}\nA \u2229 (B \u222a C) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} (elements that appear in both A and (B \u222a C))\n\nStep 3: Compare the results\n\nFrom Step 1: (A \u2229 B) \u222a (A \u2229 C) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\nFrom Step 2: A \u2229 (B \u222a C) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n\nSince both expressions evaluate to the same set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, they are equal for these specific sets.\n\nThis equality holds in general due to the distributive property of intersection over union in set theory, which states that for any sets A, B, and C:\n\nA \u2229 (B \u222a C) = (A \u2229 B) \u222a (A \u2229 C)\n\nThe intuition behind this is that an element is in A \u2229 (B \u222a C) if and only if it's in A and also in at least one of B or C. Similarly, an element is in (A \u2229 B) \u222a (A \u2229 C) if and only if it's in both A and B, or in both A and C - which is the same condition."
