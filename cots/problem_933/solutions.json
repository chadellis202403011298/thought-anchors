Determine whether the expressions in parts 1 and 2 are equal, and if they are, explain why this equality holds in general. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I've got this problem here with three sets: A, B, and C. Let me write them down first to get a clear picture. \n\nSet A is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. Okay, that's straightforward. Set B is {2, 4, 6, 8}, and set C is {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}. Got it. Now, I need to solve two set expressions and then check if they're equal. Let's take them one by one.\n\nFirst, part 1: (A \u2229 B) \u222a (A \u2229 C). Hmm, okay. So, I need to find the intersection of A and B, then the intersection of A and C, and then take the union of those two results.\n\nLet me start with A \u2229 B. A is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, and B is {2, 4, 6, 8}. The intersection means the elements that are common to both sets. So, looking at A, the numbers 2 and 4 are also in B. So, A \u2229 B should be {2, 4}. That seems right.\n\nNext, A \u2229 C. A is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, and C is {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}. The common elements here are 1, 3, and 5. So, A \u2229 C is {1, 3, 5}. Okay, got that.\n\nNow, I need to take the union of {2, 4} and {1, 3, 5}. The union means combining these sets, but without repeating elements. So, combining 2, 4 with 1, 3, 5 gives me {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. That makes sense because the union includes all elements from either set.\n\nAlright, so (A \u2229 B) \u222a (A \u2229 C) equals {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. Let me note that down.\n\nMoving on to part 2: A \u2229 (B \u222a C). Hmm, this is a bit different. Here, I need to first find the union of B and C, and then intersect that result with A.\n\nSo, let's compute B \u222a C first. B is {2, 4, 6, 8}, and C is {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}. The union combines all unique elements from both sets. So, putting them together, we have {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}. That looks correct.\n\nNow, I need to intersect this union with A. A is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. So, taking only the elements that are in both A and the union of B and C. Well, since A is entirely contained within the union (because the union includes all elements of A plus more), the intersection should just be A itself. So, A \u2229 (B \u222a C) equals {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.\n\nWait a minute, that's the same result as part 1. So, both expressions give me {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. Are they equal? Yes, they are. But why does that happen in general?\n\nLet me think about the properties of set operations. I remember that in general, distributive laws hold, meaning that union distributes over intersection. So, A \u2229 (B \u222a C) is equal to (A \u2229 B) \u222a (A \u2229 C). That's exactly what I computed here. So, this equality is due to the distributive property of unions over intersections.\n\nTo confirm, let me recall the distributive law: for any sets X, Y, Z, X \u2229 (Y \u222a Z) = (X \u2229 Y) \u222a (X \u2229 Z). Yes, that's the one. So, applying this law here, it's clear why both expressions are equal.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n1. (A \u2229 B) \u222a (A \u2229 C) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n2. A \u2229 (B \u222a C) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n3. They are equal because of the distributive law, which states that intersection distributes over union.\n\nI think that's solid. No mistakes noticed in the steps. Just to double-check, let me go through each operation again.\n\nFor part 1:\n\n- A \u2229 B: 2 and 4 are common. Correct.\n- A \u2229 C: 1, 3, 5 are common. Correct.\n- Union of {2,4} and {1,3,5} gives all elements from A. Makes sense.\n\nFor part 2:\n\n- B \u222a C: combines all elements from B and C, which includes 1-9. Correct.\n- A \u2229 (B \u222a C): since A is a subset of B \u222a C, the intersection is A itself. Correct.\n\nAnd the equality between the two expressions is a direct application of the distributive property. So, yeah, everything checks out.\nDONE.\n</think>\n\n1. (A \u2229 B) \u222a (A \u2229 C) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n2. A \u2229 (B \u222a C) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n3. They are equal because of the distributive law: A \u2229 (B \u222a C) = (A \u2229 B) \u222a (A \u2229 C).\n\nDONE."

Determine whether the expressions in parts 1 and 2 are equal, and if they are, explain why this equality holds in general. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I've got this problem here about sets A, B, and C. Let me see if I can figure it out step by step. I'm a bit new to set operations, but I'll try my best.\n\nFirst, let me write down what each set is:\n\n- Set A is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n- Set B is {2, 4, 6, 8}\n- Set C is {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}\n\nOkay, so the problem has two parts. The first part is to calculate (A \u2229 B) \u222a (A \u2229 C). The second part is to calculate A \u2229 (B \u222a C). Then, I need to determine if these two results are equal and explain why.\n\nLet me start with the first part: (A \u2229 B) \u222a (A \u2229 C).\n\nHmm, okay. So I need to find the intersection of A and B first, and then the intersection of A and C. Then, take the union of those two results.\n\nLet's compute A \u2229 B. That means elements that are in both A and B.\n\nSet A is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, and Set B is {2, 4, 6, 8}. So looking for common elements:\n\n- 2 is in both A and B.\n- 4 is also in both.\n- 6 is in B but not in A.\n- 8 is in B but not in A.\n- The other elements in A are 1, 3, 5, which aren't in B.\n\nSo A \u2229 B = {2, 4}.\n\nNow, let's compute A \u2229 C. That's the elements common to both A and C.\n\nSet A is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, and Set C is {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}.\n\nLooking for common elements:\n\n- 1 is in both A and C.\n- 3 is in both.\n- 5 is in both.\n- 7 and 9 are only in C.\n- 2 and 4 are only in A.\n\nSo A \u2229 C = {1, 3, 5}.\n\nNow, the first part is the union of {2, 4} and {1, 3, 5}. So let's combine these sets.\n\nUnion means all elements that are in either set, without duplicates.\n\nSo {2, 4, 1, 3, 5}. Let me write them in order:\n\n{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So (A \u2229 B) \u222a (A \u2229 C) is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, which is exactly set A.\n\nHmm, that's a bit surprising. Let me double-check.\n\nA \u2229 B is {2,4}, A \u2229 C is {1,3,5}. Union of these is {1,2,3,4,5}, which is A. So yeah, that's correct.\n\nOkay, moving on to the second part: A \u2229 (B \u222a C).\n\nSo I need to compute B \u222a C first, then intersect that result with A.\n\nLet me find B \u222a C. That's all elements in B or C.\n\nSet B is {2,4,6,8}, and Set C is {1,3,5,7,9}.\n\nSo combining them, without duplicates:\n\n1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.\n\nSo B \u222a C = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}.\n\nNow, A is {1,2,3,4,5}. So A \u2229 (B \u222a C) would be the elements that are in A and also in B \u222a C.\n\nBut since B \u222a C includes all elements of A except maybe some? Wait, no. Wait, A is {1,2,3,4,5}, and B \u222a C includes all of A except 6,7,8,9. But A doesn't have those elements. So A \u2229 (B \u222a C) is just A itself, right?\n\nWait, no. Wait, B \u222a C includes 1,2,3,4,5, which are all in A. So A \u2229 (B \u222a C) is {1,2,3,4,5}, which is A.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because in the first part, (A \u2229 B) \u222a (A \u2229 C) was also A. So both expressions are equal to A.\n\nBut that seems odd because usually, the order of operations can matter. But in this case, both ended up being A.\n\nLet me think again. For the first part, (A \u2229 B) \u222a (A \u2229 C) equals A because A \u2229 B is {2,4} and A \u2229 C is {1,3,5}, and their union is A.\n\nFor the second part, A \u2229 (B \u222a C) is A because B \u222a C includes all elements of A, so their intersection is A.\n\nSo both expressions equal A, so they are equal.\n\nWait, but is that always the case? Like, is (A \u2229 B) \u222a (A \u2229 C) always equal to A? Or is it specific to these sets?\n\nHmm, let me think. Suppose A is a set, and B and C are subsets of A. Then A \u2229 B is a subset of A, and A \u2229 C is also a subset of A. Their union would then be a subset of A. But since both are subsets of A, their union can't have elements outside A. So the union would be a subset of A. But is it equal to A?\n\nWait, if B and C are subsets of A, then A \u2229 B is B, and A \u2229 C is C. So (A \u2229 B) \u222a (A \u2229 C) is B \u222a C. But in our case, B \u222a C is {2,4,6,8} \u222a {1,3,5,7,9} which is {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}. But in our case, A is {1,2,3,4,5}, so B \u222a C includes elements not in A, but when we take A \u2229 (B \u222a C), which is A \u2229 (B \u222a C), which is A because A is entirely contained within B \u222a C? Wait, no.\n\nWait, in our specific case, B \u222a C is {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}. A is {1,2,3,4,5}. So A is a subset of B \u222a C. Therefore, A \u2229 (B \u222a C) is A.\n\nSimilarly, (A \u2229 B) \u222a (A \u2229 C) is {2,4} \u222a {1,3,5} = {1,2,3,4,5}, which is A.\n\nSo in this specific case, both expressions equal A, hence they are equal.\n\nBut is this always the case? Let's see.\n\nSuppose A is any set, and B and C are subsets of A. Then:\n\n(A \u2229 B) \u222a (A \u2229 C) = (B) \u222a (C) = B \u222a C.\n\nBut since B and C are subsets of A, B \u222a C is also a subset of A. So (A \u2229 B) \u222a (A \u2229 C) is B \u222a C, which is a subset of A.\n\nOn the other hand, A \u2229 (B \u222a C) is A \u2229 (B \u222a C). Since B \u222a C is a superset of A, because A is a subset of B \u222a C (since B and C are subsets of A, so their union is also a subset of A). Wait, no. Wait, if B and C are subsets of A, then B \u222a C is also a subset of A. So A \u2229 (B \u222a C) is A.\n\nWait, that contradicts what I thought earlier. Let me clarify.\n\nIf B and C are subsets of A, then B \u222a C is a subset of A. Therefore, A \u2229 (B \u222a C) is A \u2229 (something that's a subset of A), which is just A \u2229 (B \u222a C). But since B \u222a C is a subset of A, A \u2229 (B \u222a C) is B \u222a C.\n\nWait, so in that case, (A \u2229 B) \u222a (A \u2229 C) is B \u222a C, which is a subset of A. And A \u2229 (B \u222a C) is also B \u222a C. So both expressions equal B \u222a C, which is a subset of A.\n\nWait, but in our specific case, B \u222a C was {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}, which is not a subset of A because A only goes up to 5. Wait, no, in our case, B and C are subsets of A, but their union is not a subset of A because they include elements outside A.\n\nWait, that can't be. If B and C are subsets of A, then their union should also be a subset of A. But in our case, B is {2,4,6,8}, and C is {1,3,5,7,9}. Wait, but 6,7,8,9 are not in A. So that contradicts the assumption that B and C are subsets of A. Wait, no, in the problem statement, B and C are defined as separate sets, not necessarily subsets of A.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me check the problem again.\n\nSets A, B, and C are defined as:\n\nA = {1,2,3,4,5}\n\nB = {2,4,6,8}\n\nC = {1,3,5,7,9}\n\nSo B and C are not subsets of A because they have elements not in A, like 6,8 in B and 7,9 in C.\n\nTherefore, B and C are not subsets of A. So my earlier assumption was wrong.\n\nTherefore, B \u222a C is not necessarily a subset of A.\n\nSo, in that case, (A \u2229 B) \u222a (A \u2229 C) is the union of two subsets of A, which may or may not cover all of A.\n\nSimilarly, A \u2229 (B \u222a C) is the intersection of A with the union of B and C, which could be a superset of A or a subset, depending on B and C.\n\nSo in our specific case, let's re-examine.\n\nFirst part: (A \u2229 B) \u222a (A \u2229 C).\n\nA \u2229 B is {2,4}, A \u2229 C is {1,3,5}. Their union is {1,2,3,4,5}, which is A.\n\nSecond part: A \u2229 (B \u222a C).\n\nB \u222a C is {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}. Now, A is {1,2,3,4,5}, so A \u2229 (B \u222a C) is {1,2,3,4,5}, which is A.\n\nSo both expressions equal A.\n\nBut wait, in general, is this always the case?\n\nSuppose A, B, and C are arbitrary sets. Let me consider another example to test.\n\nLet me take A = {1,2,3}, B = {2,4}, C = {3,5}.\n\nCompute (A \u2229 B) \u222a (A \u2229 C):\n\nA \u2229 B = {2}, A \u2229 C = {3}. Their union is {2,3}, which is not equal to A.\n\nA \u2229 (B \u222a C):\n\nB \u222a C = {2,3,4,5}. A \u2229 (B \u222a C) = {2,3}, which is not equal to A.\n\nSo in this case, (A \u2229 B) \u222a (A \u2229 C) is {2,3}, and A \u2229 (B \u222a C) is also {2,3}. So they are equal in this case.\n\nWait, but in my first example, they were equal. Let me try another example.\n\nLet me take A = {1,2,3,4}, B = {2,4}, C = {1,3}.\n\nCompute (A \u2229 B) \u222a (A \u2229 C):\n\nA \u2229 B = {2,4}, A \u2229 C = {1,3}. Their union is {1,2,3,4}, which is A.\n\nCompute A \u2229 (B \u222a C):\n\nB \u222a C = {1,2,3,4}. A \u2229 (B \u222a C) = {1,2,3,4}, which is A.\n\nSo again, both expressions equal A.\n\nWait, but in my first example, they didn't equal A, but in the second example, they did.\n\nWait, no, in my first example, A = {1,2,3}, B = {2,4}, C = {3,5}.\n\n(A \u2229 B) \u222a (A \u2229 C) = {2} \u222a {3} = {2,3}.\n\nA \u2229 (B \u222a C) = A \u2229 {2,3,4,5} = {2,3}.\n\nSo both expressions equal {2,3}, which is not equal to A.\n\nSo in this case, they are equal but not equal to A.\n\nWait, but in the second example, they were equal to A.\n\nSo is there a pattern here?\n\nWait, perhaps if B and C are subsets of A, then (A \u2229 B) \u222a (A \u2229 C) = B \u222a C, which is a subset of A, and A \u2229 (B \u222a C) is B \u222a C. So in that case, both expressions equal B \u222a C, which is a subset of A.\n\nBut if B and C are not subsets of A, then (A \u2229 B) \u222a (A \u2229 C) is the union of two subsets of A, which may or may not equal A.\n\nSimilarly, A \u2229 (B \u222a C) is the intersection of A with B \u222a C, which could be a superset of A or a subset, depending on B \u222a C.\n\nWait, in our original problem, both expressions equal A, but in my first example, they equal {2,3}, which is not A.\n\nSo perhaps the equality holds when B and C are such that their union is A, but that's not necessarily always the case.\n\nWait, in the original problem, B \u222a C is {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}, which includes A and more. So A \u2229 (B \u222a C) is A, because all elements of A are in B \u222a C.\n\nSimilarly, (A \u2229 B) \u222a (A \u2229 C) is A because A \u2229 B and A \u2229 C together cover all elements of A.\n\nBut in my first example, B \u222a C includes elements not in A, but A \u2229 (B \u222a C) is still {2,3}, which is not A because A is {1,2,3}.\n\nWait, no, in my first example, A is {1,2,3}, B is {2,4}, C is {3,5}.\n\nB \u222a C is {2,3,4,5}.\n\nA \u2229 (B \u222a C) is {2,3}, which is not A.\n\nBut in the original problem, A is {1,2,3,4,5}, B \u222a C is {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}.\n\nSo A \u2229 (B \u222a C) is {1,2,3,4,5}, which is A.\n\nSo the difference is whether A is a subset of B \u222a C.\n\nIn the original problem, since B and C are defined such that their union includes all elements of A, plus more, so A is a subset of B \u222a C. Therefore, A \u2229 (B \u222a C) is A.\n\nSimilarly, (A \u2229 B) \u222a (A \u2229 C) is the union of subsets of A, which in this case covers all elements of A.\n\nBut in my first example, A is {1,2,3}, and B \u222a C is {2,3,4,5}, so A is not a subset of B \u222a C, hence A \u2229 (B \u222a C) is {2,3}, not A.\n\nSo in the original problem, since A is a subset of B \u222a C, both expressions equal A. But in general, it's not necessarily the case.\n\nTherefore, in the original problem, both expressions equal A, so they are equal.\n\nBut to answer the question, I need to explain why in general, whether these two expressions are equal.\n\nSo, in general, are (A \u2229 B) \u222a (A \u2229 C) and A \u2229 (B \u222a C) equal?\n\nFrom my examples, sometimes yes, sometimes no.\n\nWait, let me think about the general case.\n\nLet me consider arbitrary sets A, B, C.\n\nWe need to check if (A \u2229 B) \u222a (A \u2229 C) = A \u2229 (B \u222a C).\n\nLet me see.\n\nLet me denote X = (A \u2229 B) \u222a (A \u2229 C), and Y = A \u2229 (B \u222a C).\n\nWe need to check if X = Y.\n\nTo check if two sets are equal, we can see if X \u2286 Y and Y \u2286 X.\n\nFirst, let's see if X \u2286 Y.\n\nTake any element x in X.

Therefore, A \u2229 B = {2, 4}.\n\nNext, I need to find A \u2229 C. That's the intersection of A and C.\n\nSet A is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n\nSet C is {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}\n\nCommon elements are 1, 3, and 5. So, A \u2229 C = {1, 3, 5}.\n\nNow, I have to take the union of {2, 4} and {1, 3, 5}. The union means combining all the elements from both sets without duplicates.\n\nSo, {2, 4} \u222a {1, 3, 5} = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. That's set A itself, isn't it? Wait, let me check.\n\nSet A is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, and the union we just did is also {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. So yes, (A \u2229 B) \u222a (A \u2229 C) equals A.\n\nHmm, that's interesting. Maybe there's a general principle here. Let me hold that thought for now and move on to the second expression.\n\nThe second expression is A \u2229 (B \u222a C).\n\nFirst, I need to find B \u222a C. That's the union of B and C.\n\nSet B is {2, 4, 6, 8}\n\nSet C is {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}\n\nCombining them, we get {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.\n\nSo, B \u222a C = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}\n\nNow, intersect this with A. A is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.\n\nSo, A \u2229 (B \u222a C) is the elements common to both A and (B \u222a C). But since A is entirely within B \u222a C, except for 6,7,8,9, but A doesn't have those. So, all elements of A are in B \u222a C. Therefore, A \u2229 (B \u222a C) is just A itself, {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.\n\nWait a minute, that's the same as the first expression's result. So both (A \u2229 B) \u222a (A \u2229 C) and A \u2229 (B \u222a C) equal A.\n\nSo, yes, they are equal. But why does that happen in general?\n\nLet me think about set theory principles. There's a distributive law which states that A \u2229 (B \u222a C) = (A \u2229 B) \u222a (A \u2229 C). So that's exactly what's happening here. The distributive law distributes the intersection over the union.\n\nSo, in this case, both expressions simplify to A because of how the sets are structured. Since A is entirely contained within both B and C in certain ways, when you distribute the intersection, you end up reconstructing A.\n\nLet me double-check my work to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst expression:\n\nA \u2229 B = {2,4}\n\nA \u2229 C = {1,3,5}\n\nUnion of these is {1,2,3,4,5} which is A.\n\nSecond expression:\n\nB \u222a C = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}\n\nA \u2229 (B \u222a C) = {1,2,3,4,5} which is A.\n\nYes, both are A, so they are equal because of the distributive property of sets.\n\nI think that's solid. No mistakes noticed.\n</think>\n\n1. **(A \u2229 B) \u222a (A \u2229 C)**  \nFirst, find A \u2229 B:  \nA = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}  \nB = {2, 4, 6, 8}  \nA \u2229 B = {2, 4}  \n\nNext, find A \u2229 C:  \nC = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}  \nA \u2229 C = {1, 3, 5}  \n\nThen, take the union of {2, 4} and {1, 3, 5}:  \n{2, 4} \u222a {1, 3, 5} = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} = A  \n\n2. **A \u2229 (B \u222a C)**  \nFirst, find B \u222a C:  \nB = {2, 4, 6, 8}  \nC = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}  \nB \u222a C = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}  \n\nThen, intersect with A:  \nA = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}  \nA \u2229 (B \u222a C) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} = A  \n\n3. **Equality Check**  \nBoth expressions equal A because of the distributive property:  \nA \u2229 (B \u222a C) = (A \u2229 B) \u222a (A \u2229 C)  \n\n**Final Answer:**  \n1. {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}  \n2. {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}  \nThey are equal because of the distributive property of sets.  \nDONE."

Calculate the following set expressions and explain your reasoning step by step:\n\n1. (A \u2229 B) \u222a (A \u2229 C)\n2. A \u2229 (B \u222a C)\n3. Determine whether the expressions in parts 1 and 2 are equal, and if they are, explain why this equality holds in general. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this problem with three sets A, B, and C. Let me write them down first to make sure I have them correctly.\n\nSet A is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, set B is {2, 4, 6, 8}, and set C is {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}. Okay, got that.\n\nNow, I need to solve three parts: first, calculate (A \u2229 B) \u222a (A \u2229 C), then calculate A \u2229 (B \u222a C), and finally, determine if these two results are equal.\n\nLet me start with the first part: (A \u2229 B) \u222a (A \u2229 C).\n\nI know that \u2229 stands for intersection, which means elements that are in both sets. \u222a stands for union, which means all elements that are in either set.\n\nSo, first, I'll find A \u2229 B. That is, elements that are in both A and B.\n\nLooking at A: 1,2,3,4,5\nLooking at B: 2,4,6,8\nSo, the common elements are 2 and 4. Therefore, A \u2229 B = {2,4}.\n\nNext, A \u2229 C. Let's see, A has 1,2,3,4,5 and C has 1,3,5,7,9. So, the common elements are 1, 3, 5. So, A \u2229 C = {1,3,5}.\n\nNow, I need to take the union of these two sets: {2,4} \u222a {1,3,5}. Union means combining all unique elements. So, putting them together: 1,2,3,4,5. So, (A \u2229 B) \u222a (A \u2229 C) = {1,2,3,4,5}.\n\nAlright, that's the first part done.\n\nMoving on to the second part: A \u2229 (B \u222a C).\n\nAgain, let me break it down. First, find B \u222a C, then intersect that with A.\n\nSo, B \u222a C is the union of B and C. B is {2,4,6,8}, C is {1,3,5,7,9}. The union would include all elements from both, without duplicates. So, combining them: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. So, B \u222a C = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}.\n\nNow, intersect that with A. A is {1,2,3,4,5}. So, A \u2229 (B \u222a C) would be the elements common to both A and (B \u222a C). Looking at A, all its elements are in B \u222a C except... wait, actually, A is a subset of B \u222a C. Because A's elements are 1,2,3,4,5, which are all in B \u222a C. So, the intersection is just A itself. Therefore, A \u2229 (B \u222a C) = {1,2,3,4,5}.\n\nWait a minute, that's the same as the first part! So, both (A \u2229 B) \u222a (A \u2229 C) and A \u2229 (B \u222a C) equal {1,2,3,4,5}. So, they are equal.\n\nBut let me think about why this is the case in general. I remember something about distributive laws in sets. Specifically, the distributive law states that for any sets A, B, C, the following hold:\n\nA \u2229 (B \u222a C) = (A \u2229 B) \u222a (A \u2229 C)\n\nSo, this is exactly what's happening here. The first expression distributes over the union, and the second expression is the same as the intersection followed by the union.\n\nTherefore, in general, these two expressions are equal because of the distributive property of intersection over union. That's why both parts 1 and 2 give the same result.\n\nLet me double-check my work to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst part: A \u2229 B is {2,4}, A \u2229 C is {1,3,5}. Union is {1,2,3,4,5}. Correct.\n\nSecond part: B \u222a C is {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}, intersect with A is {1,2,3,4,5}. Correct.\n\nAnd since both equal {1,2,3,4,5}, they are equal. Also, the distributive law explains this equality. So, I think I'm confident with this solution.\n</think>\n\n1. (A \u2229 B) \u222a (A \u2229 C) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n\n2. A \u2229 (B \u222a C) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n\nBoth expressions are equal because of the distributive property of intersection over union. Therefore, (A \u2229 B) \u222a (A \u2229 C) is equal to A \u2229 (B \u222a C).\n\nDONE."

(A \u2229 B) \u222a (A \u2229 C)**\n\nAlright, so first, I need to find the intersection of A and B, which is A \u2229 B. Intersection means elements that are in both sets. Let me look at A and B.\n\nA has 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. B has 2, 4, 6, 8. So, the common elements are 2 and 4. Therefore, A \u2229 B is {2, 4}.\n\nNext, I need to find A \u2229 C. C has 1, 3, 5, 7, 9. Comparing with A, the common elements are 1, 3, 5. So, A \u2229 C is {1, 3, 5}.\n\nNow, I have to take the union of these two results: {2, 4} \u222a {1, 3, 5}. The union combines all unique elements from both sets. So, that would be {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.\n\nWait, that's just set A itself. Is that right? Let me double-check. A \u2229 B is {2,4}, A \u2229 C is {1,3,5}. Union of those is all elements from both, so 1,2,3,4,5. Yep, that's exactly A. So, the first expression simplifies to A.\n\n**2. A \u2229 (B \u222a C)**\n\nAlright, now the second expression: A \u2229 (B \u222a C). I need to find the union of B and C first, then intersect that with A.\n\nLet's find B \u222a C. B is {2,4,6,8}, C is {1,3,5,7,9}. The union combines all elements, so that would be {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}.\n\nNow, intersect this with A. A is {1,2,3,4,5}. So, the intersection is the elements common to both, which are 1,2,3,4,5. That's set A again.\n\nWait, so both expressions simplified to A? Interesting. Let me think if that's always the case.\n\n**3. Determine whether the expressions in parts 1 and 2 are equal, and if they are, explain why this equality holds in general.**\n\nFrom the above, both (A \u2229 B) \u222a (A \u2229 C) and A \u2229 (B \u222a C) simplified to A. So yes, they are equal.\n\nWhy does this happen? Let's recall some set theory rules. The distributive law states that A \u2229 (B \u222a C) = (A \u2229 B) \u222a (A \u2229 C). So, this is a specific case where the distributive law holds, and as a result, both expressions are equal to A.\n\nSo, in general, for any sets A, B, and C, (A \u2229 B) \u222a (A \u2229 C) is equal to A \u2229 (B \u222a C). This is due to the distributive property of intersection over union.\n\nWait, is that always true? Let me think. I remember that intersection distributes over union, yes. So, this is a standard result in set theory. Therefore, in this case, both expressions are indeed equal because of the distributive property.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n1. (A \u2229 B) \u222a (A \u2229 C) = A\n2. A \u2229 (B \u222a C) = A\n3. They are equal because of the distributive property of intersection over union.\n\nI think that covers everything the question asked for. I should make sure I didn't make any mistakes in calculating the intersections and unions. Let me quickly go through them again.\n\nFor part 1:\n\n- A \u2229 B: elements common to A and B are 2,4.

The union combines these sets, so I just list all unique elements from both:\n\n- From {2, 4}: 2, 4\n- From {1, 3, 5}: 1, 3, 5\n\nPutting them together: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. So, (A \u2229 B) \u222a (A \u2229 C) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.\n\nAlright, that's the first part done. Now, moving on to the second expression: A \u2229 (B \u222a C). This is an intersection of A with the union of B and C. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, find B \u222a C. That is, all elements in B or C.\n\n- B has 2, 4, 6, 8.\n- C has 1, 3, 5, 7, 9.\n\nCombining these, we get {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}. So, B \u222a C = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.\n\nNow, intersect this with A. A is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. So, A \u2229 (B \u222a C) would be the elements common to both A and (B \u222a C).\n\nLooking at A, all its elements are already in (B \u222a C) because:\n\n- 1 is in C\n- 2 is in B\n- 3 is in C\n- 4 is in B\n- 5 is in C\n\nSo, every element of A is also in (B \u222a C). Therefore, A \u2229 (B \u222a C) = A, which is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.\n\nWait a second, that's the same result as the first expression. So, both (A \u2229 B) \u222a (A \u2229 C) and A \u2229 (B \u222a C) equal {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. Therefore, they are equal.\n\nNow, to explain why this happens in general. I remember there's a distributive law in set theory that states:\n\nA \u2229 (B \u222a C) = (A \u2229 B) \u222a (A \u2229 C)\n\nThis law allows us to distribute the intersection over the union. So, in this case, both expressions are just two different ways of writing the same set. That's why they are equal.\n\nLet me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor (A \u2229 B) \u222a (A \u2229 C):\n\n- A \u2229 B: {2, 4}\n- A \u2229 C: {1, 3, 5}\n- Union: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n\nFor A \u2229 (B \u222a C):\n\n- B \u222a C: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}\n- Intersection with A: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n\nYes, both are correct and equal. So, the equality holds because of the distributive law in set theory.\n</think>\n\n1. **(A \u2229 B) \u222a (A \u2229 C)**  \n   - First, find A \u2229 B: {2, 4}  \n   - Then, find A \u2229 C: {1, 3, 5}  \n   - Union these results: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}  \n\n2. **A \u2229 (B \u222a C)**  \n   - First, find B \u222a C: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}  \n   - Then, intersect with A: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}  \n\n3. Both expressions equal {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} due to the distributive law A \u2229 (B \u222a C) = (A \u2229 B) \u222a (A \u2229 C).\n\n**Answer:**  \n1. {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}  \n2. {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}  \n3.

Determine whether the expressions in parts 1 and 2 are equal, and if they are, explain why this equality holds in general. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this problem here with three sets: A, B, and C. Let me first write them down clearly to make sure I understand them.\n\nSet A is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, set B is {2, 4, 6, 8}, and set C is {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}. Okay, so all three sets are collections of numbers, and I need to work with their intersections and unions.\n\nThe first part of the problem asks me to calculate (A \u2229 B) \u222a (A \u2229 C). Hmm, let's break this down. I remember that \u2229 stands for intersection, which means elements common to both sets, and \u222a stands for union, which is elements in either of the sets.\n\nSo, first, I need to find A \u2229 B. That would be the numbers that are in both A and B. Let me list out A and B again. A has 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and B has 2, 4, 6, 8. Comparing these, the common elements are 2 and 4. So, A \u2229 B is {2, 4}.\n\nNext, I need to find A \u2229 C. A is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} and C is {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}. The common elements here are 1, 3, and 5. So, A \u2229 C is {1, 3, 5}.\n\nNow, the expression is (A \u2229 B) \u222a (A \u2229 C), which is {2, 4} \u222a {1, 3, 5}. The union means combining these two sets, but without repeating any elements. So, putting them together, we have {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. That's straightforward.\n\nMoving on to the second part: A \u2229 (B \u222a C). Again, I need to handle the operations step by step. First, find B \u222a C. B is {2, 4, 6, 8} and C is {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}. The union of these would include all elements from both sets, so combining them gives {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.\n\nNow, I need to find A \u2229 (B \u222a C). A is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, and B \u222a C is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}. The intersection here would be the elements common to both A and B \u222a C. Looking at A, all its elements are already in B \u222a C except maybe 6, 7, 8, 9, but since A doesn't have those, the intersection is just A itself. So, A \u2229 (B \u222a C) is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.\n\nNow, the third part asks whether the expressions from part 1 and part 2 are equal. So, part 1 was (A \u2229 B) \u222a (A \u2229 C) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, and part 2 was A \u2229 (B \u222a C) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. They both result in the same set, which is A. \n\nI should think about why this is always true. In general, for any sets A, B, and C, is (A \u2229 B) \u222a (A \u2229 C) equal to A \u2229 (B \u222a C)? Let me recall some set theory rules.\n\nI remember that distributive laws in sets state that A \u2229 (B \u222a C) is equal to (A \u2229 B) \u222a (A \u2229 C). So, this is a specific case of the distributive law where the intersection distributes over the union. That's why both expressions result in the same set, which in this case is A itself.\n\nSo, to sum up, both expressions simplify to the set A because of the distributive property of intersections over unions in set theory.\n</think>\n\n1. **(A \u2229 B) \u222a (A \u2229 C):**  \nFirst, find A \u2229 B = {2, 4}. Then, A \u2229 C = {1, 3, 5}. The union of these sets is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.\n\n2. **A \u2229 (B \u222a C):**  \nFirst, find B \u222a C = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}. Then, A \u2229 (B \u222a C) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.\n\n3. **Equality Check:**  \nBoth expressions equal {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, which is set A. This holds due to the distributive property of intersections over unions.\n\n**Answer:**  \n1. {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}  \n2. {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}  \n3. Yes, they are equal because of the distributive property in set theory.  \nDONE."

Determine whether the expressions in parts 1 and 2 are equal, and if they are, explain why this equality holds in general. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this problem with sets A, B, and C. Let me try to figure out each part step by step. First, I'll write down what each set is:\n\n- Set A is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n- Set B is {2, 4, 6, 8}\n- Set C is {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}\n\nOkay, now let's tackle the first expression: (A \u2229 B) \u222a (A \u2229 C). Hmm, I think I need to find the intersection of A and B first, and then the intersection of A and C, and then take the union of those two results.\n\nStarting with A \u2229 B. Set A has elements 1,2,3,4,5, and set B has 2,4,6,8. The intersection means elements that are in both A and B. So, looking at A, the elements that are also in B are 2 and 4. So, A \u2229 B = {2, 4}.\n\nNext, A \u2229 C. Set A is {1,2,3,4,5}, and set C is {1,3,5,7,9}. The common elements here are 1, 3, and 5. So, A \u2229 C = {1, 3, 5}.\n\nNow, I need to take the union of these two sets: {2, 4} \u222a {1, 3, 5}. The union means combining all unique elements from both sets. So, that would be {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. Let me double-check: 1 from the second set, 2 and 4 from the first, and 3 and 5 from the second. Yep, that's all the elements.\n\nMoving on to the second expression: A \u2229 (B \u222a C). This means I should first find the union of B and C, and then intersect that with A.\n\nStarting with B \u222a C. Set B is {2,4,6,8}, and set C is {1,3,5,7,9}. The union combines all elements, so we have {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}. Now, intersecting this with A, which is {1,2,3,4,5}. So, the common elements are 1,2,3,4,5. Therefore, A \u2229 (B \u222a C) is {1,2,3,4,5}.\n\nWait a second, both expressions resulted in {1,2,3,4,5}. So, for part 3, I need to determine if they are equal. It seems they are, but let me think why that happens in general. \n\nIn general, when dealing with sets, the distributive property holds: A \u2229 (B \u222a C) = (A \u2229 B) \u222a (A \u2229 C). This means that taking the intersection after the union is the same as taking the union of the intersections. So, in this specific case, both expressions evaluate to the same set because of this property.\n\nLet me just recap:\n\n1. (A \u2229 B) \u222a (A \u2229 C) = {2,4} \u222a {1,3,5} = {1,2,3,4,5}\n2. A \u2229 (B \u222a C) = {1,2,3,4,5}\n3. They are equal because of the distributive property of sets over union.\n\nI think that's it. Both expressions result in the same set, which makes sense based on the properties of set operations.\n</think>\n\n1. (A \u2229 B) \u222a (A \u2229 C) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n2. A \u2229 (B \u222a C) = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n3. Yes, they are equal due to the distributive property: A \u2229 (B \u222a C) = (A \u2229 B) \u222a (A \u2229 C).\n\nDONE."

Let me write them down first to make sure I have everything clear. \n\nSet A is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. Okay, that's straightforward. Set B is {2, 4, 6, 8}. Hmm, so even numbers starting from 2. And set C is {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}. So that's all the odd numbers from 1 to 9. \n\nThe problem has two parts. The first part is (A \u2229 B) \u222a (A \u2229 C). The second part is A \u2229 (B \u222a C). Then I need to determine if these two results are equal and explain why.\n\nStarting with the first expression: (A \u2229 B) \u222a (A \u2229 C).\n\nI remember that \u2229 stands for intersection, which means elements common to both sets. \u222a stands for union, meaning elements that are in either of the sets.\n\nSo, let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, find A \u2229 B. That is, elements that are in both A and B.\n\nLooking at A: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\nLooking at B: {2, 4, 6, 8}\n\nCommon elements are 2 and 4. So, A \u2229 B = {2, 4}.\n\nNext, find A \u2229 C.

So (A \u2229 B) \u222a (A \u2229 C) equals A.\n\nNow, moving on to the second expression: A \u2229 (B \u222a C).\n\nAgain, let's break it down.\n\nFirst, find B \u222a C. That is, all elements in B or C.\n\nSet B: {2, 4, 6, 8}\nSet C: {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}\n\nCombining these, we have {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}. \n\nNow, find A \u2229 (B \u222a C). So, elements in A that are also in B \u222a C.\n\nSet A: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n\nComparing A with B \u222a C, all elements of A are in B \u222a C except maybe 6,7,8,9, but those aren't in A.
