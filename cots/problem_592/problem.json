  "question": "A man lives in a small apartment on the 30th floor of a high-rise building. Every morning, he takes the elevator down to the ground floor to go to work. In the evening, when he returns, he takes the elevator to the 15th floor and then walks up the stairs for the remaining 15 floors to his apartment. However, on rainy days, he takes the elevator all the way up to the 30th floor. Why does he do this?",
  "answer": "The man is of short stature and cannot reach the button for the 30th floor in the elevator. He can only reach the buttons up to the 15th floor. On rainy days, he carries an umbrella, which he can use to press the 30th floor button.\n\nThis problem requires creative reframing because the initial assumption most people make is that there must be something wrong with the elevator or that the man has some strange preference or superstition. The key insight comes from reframing the problem to consider the man's physical limitations rather than focusing on the elevator or the weather as the primary factor. The umbrella provides the solution because it serves a dual purpose - protection from rain and as a tool to overcome a height limitation - which isn't immediately obvious from the problem statement. This demonstrates lateral thinking by encouraging you to step outside conventional problem-solving approaches and consider unexpected connections between elements of the scenario."
