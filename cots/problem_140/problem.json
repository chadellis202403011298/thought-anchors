  "question": "A small town library wants to increase visitor engagement. They've noticed that local coffee shops have successfully created loyal customers by offering a punch card system (buy 10 coffees, get 1 free). Using analogical transfer, identify how the library could adapt this concept to their context. What specific program could they implement that transfers the core principles of the coffee shop loyalty system to the library setting? Describe one detailed solution.",
  "answer": "To solve this problem using analogical transfer, I need to identify the core principles of the coffee shop loyalty system and map them to the library context.\n\n1. First, I'll identify the key elements of the coffee shop punch card system:\n   - Encourages repeat visits\n   - Tracks customer activity\n   - Provides a reward after a certain threshold of activity\n   - Creates a sense of progress toward a goal\n   - The reward is related to the core service (free coffee)\n\n2. Now, I'll map these elements to the library context:\n   - The library wants repeat visitors rather than purchases\n   - They need to track patron activity\n   - They should offer a meaningful reward to library users\n   - The system should create a sense of progress\n   - The reward should relate to library services\n\n3. A specific solution would be a \"Reader's Reward Card\" where:\n   - Patrons receive a card that gets stamped for each library visit or for each book borrowed\n   - After 10 stamps, they earn a reward\n   - The reward could be a free book from the library's used book sale section, priority reservation for a new release, extended borrowing period for one item, or a small credit toward printing/copying services\n   - The card would visually show progress (empty circles that get filled with each visit/borrow)\n   - The library could theme these cards seasonally or by genre to encourage diverse reading\n\nThis solution transfers the core loyalty mechanism from the coffee shop context to the library setting while adapting it specifically to library services and goals."
