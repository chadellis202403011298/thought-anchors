  "question": "A small local bakery receives customers according to a Poisson process with a rate of 12 customers per hour. The bakery opens at 8:00 AM. \n\n(a) What is the probability that the bakery receives exactly 3 customers in the first 15 minutes of operation?\n\n(b) Given that 5 customers arrived during the first half hour, what is the probability that exactly 2 of them arrived during the first 15 minutes?",
  "answer": "To solve this problem, I'll apply key properties of Poisson processes.\n\n(a) For a Poisson process with rate \u03bb = 12 customers per hour, the number of arrivals in any time interval of length t follows a Poisson distribution with parameter \u03bbt.\n\nFor a 15-minute interval, t = 15/60 = 0.25 hours.\nSo \u03bbt = 12 \u00d7 0.25 = 3 customers in 15 minutes (on average).\n\nThe probability of exactly k arrivals in a Poisson process is:\nP(X = k) = e^(-\u03bbt) \u00d7 (\u03bbt)^k / k!\n\nSubstituting k = 3 and \u03bbt = 3:\nP(X = 3) = e^(-3) \u00d7 3^3 / 3!\nP(X = 3) = e^(-3) \u00d7 27 / 6\nP(X = 3) = 0.0498 \u00d7 4.5\nP(X = 3) \u2248 0.224 or about 22.4%\n\n(b) For this part, I need to use the property that non-overlapping increments in a Poisson process are independent, and the fact that the distribution of arrival times, given a fixed number of arrivals in an interval, follows a uniform distribution.\n\nLet's denote:\n- A = number of arrivals in first 15 minutes\n- B = number of arrivals in second 15 minutes\n- We know A + B = 5\n\nGiven the uniform property of arrival times in a Poisson process, each of the 5 arrivals in the 30-minute interval has an equal probability of occurring in the first or second 15-minute interval. Specifically, each arrival has a 0.5 probability of being in the first 15 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the random variable A follows a Binomial distribution with parameters n = 5 and p = 0.5.\n\nThe probability that exactly 2 arrivals occurred in the first 15 minutes is:\nP(A = 2 | A + B = 5) = C(5,2) \u00d7 (0.5)^2 \u00d7 (0.5)^3\nP(A = 2 | A + B = 5) = 10 \u00d7 0.25 \u00d7 0.125\nP(A = 2 | A + B = 5) = 0.3125 or 31.25%"
