End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: A small local bakery receives customers according to a Poisson process with a rate of 12 customers per hour. The bakery opens at 8:00 AM. \n\n(a) What is the probability that the bakery receives exactly 3 customers in the first 15 minutes of operation?\n\n(b) Given that 5 customers arrived during the first half hour, what is the probability that exactly 2 of them arrived during the first 15 minutes? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I've got this problem about a bakery that's receiving customers according to a Poisson process. I remember that a Poisson process is a way to model the number of events happening in a fixed interval of time, like customer arrivals in this case. The rate is given as 12 customers per hour. The bakery opens at 8:00 AM, and there are two parts to the problem.\n\nStarting with part (a): What's the probability that the bakery receives exactly 3 customers in the first 15 minutes of operation? Hmm, okay. So, first, I need to figure out the Poisson probability mass function because that's used for counting the number of events in a Poisson process.\n\nThe Poisson probability formula is P(k; \u03bb) = (e^(-\u03bb) * \u03bb^k) / k!, where \u03bb is the average rate (or expected number of occurrences) and k is the number of occurrences we're interested in. \n\nBut wait, I need to make sure about the units here. The rate is 12 customers per hour, and the time we're considering is 15 minutes. So, first, I should convert the rate to per minute because the time is in minutes. \n\nSince there are 60 minutes in an hour, 12 customers per hour is equivalent to 12/60 = 0.2 customers per minute. That makes sense because in 15 minutes, the expected number of customers would be 0.2 * 15 = 3. Oh, interesting, so the expected number of customers in 15 minutes is exactly 3. \n\nBut we're looking for the probability of exactly 3 customers. So, plugging into the formula, \u03bb here is 0.2 because that's the average rate per minute. So, \u03bb = 0.2, k = 3.\n\nCalculating that: P(3; 0.2) = (e^(-0.2) * (0.2)^3) / 3! \n\nLet me compute each part step by step. First, e^(-0.2). I know that e^(-0.2) is approximately 0.8187. \n\nThen, (0.2)^3 is 0.008. \n\nNext, 3! is 6. \n\nSo putting it all together: (0.8187 * 0.008) / 6. \n\nMultiplying 0.8187 by 0.008 gives approximately 0.00655. \n\nThen, divide that by 6: 0.00655 / 6 \u2248 0.001092. \n\nSo, the probability is approximately 0.1092%, or about 0.0011. That seems pretty low, but considering that the average is 3, the probability of exactly 3 might not be that high. Wait, no, actually, the Poisson distribution can have higher probabilities around the mean. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, let me double-check. e^(-0.2) is correct? Let me calculate e^(-0.2) more accurately. Using a calculator, e^(-0.2) \u2248 0.818730753. \n\n(0.2)^3 is indeed 0.008. \n\nSo, 0.818730753 * 0.008 = 0.006550984. \n\nDivide by 6: 0.006550984 / 6 \u2248 0.001091647. \n\nSo, approximately 0.001091647, which is about 0.109%. That seems correct. So, the probability is approximately 0.0011 or 0.109%.\n\nMoving on to part (b): Given that 5 customers arrived during the first half hour, what is the probability that exactly 2 of them arrived during the first 15 minutes? \n\nHmm, this sounds like a conditional probability problem. So, we need to find P(exactly 2 in first 15 minutes | 5 in first half hour). \n\nUsing the formula for conditional probability: P(A|B) = P(A \u2229 B) / P(B). \n\nBut in this case, if we know that 5 customers arrived in the first half hour, then the number of customers in the first 15 minutes can be either 2 or 3, because the second 15 minutes would then have either 3 or 2 customers respectively. \n\nWait, no, actually, the first half hour is 30 minutes, so the first 15 minutes and the second 15 minutes. If exactly 5 arrived in 30 minutes, then the number in the first 15 minutes could be k, and the number in the second 15 minutes would be 5 - k. \n\nBut we're looking for the probability that exactly 2 arrived in the first 15 minutes given that 5 arrived in the first 30 minutes. So, we need to compute the probability that k=2 in the first 15 minutes and k=3 in the second 15 minutes, given that the total is 5.\n\nBut since the Poisson process is independent over non-overlapping intervals, the number of customers in the first 15 minutes and the second 15 minutes are independent Poisson variables with parameters \u03bb1 and \u03bb2, where \u03bb1 = 0.2 (since 0.2 per minute *15 minutes) and \u03bb2 = 0.2 *15=3? Wait, no, that's not correct.\n\nWait, the rate is 12 per hour, so per minute it's 0.2. So, for the first 15 minutes, the rate is 0.2 per minute, so \u03bb1=0.2*15=3. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the Poisson process has rate \u03bb per minute, so for 15 minutes, the expected number is \u03bb*15. But \u03bb is 0.2 per minute, so 0.2*15=3. So, the first 15 minutes have a Poisson distribution with \u03bb=3, and the second 15 minutes also have \u03bb=3 because the rate is constant.\n\nWait, but if the total in 30 minutes is 5, then the sum of the two independent Poisson variables is 5. So, the joint probability is the probability that the first 15 minutes has k and the second 15 minutes has (5 - k). \n\nBut we need to find the probability that k=2 in the first 15 minutes given that the total is 5. So, the conditional probability is the probability that k=2 and (5 - k)=3 in the second 15 minutes, divided by the probability that the total is 5.\n\nSo, mathematically, P(k=2 | total=5) = P(k=2 and 5 - k=3) / P(total=5). \n\nBut since the two intervals are independent, P(k=2 and 5 -k=3) = P(k=2) * P(5 -k=3). \n\nSo, P(k=2) is the Poisson PMF with \u03bb=3: P(2;3) = (e^(-3) * 3^2)/2! = (e^(-3) *9)/2 \u2248 (0.0498 *9)/2 \u2248 0.2245. \n\nSimilarly, P(3;3) is the same as P(2;3) because of symmetry: (e^(-3)*3^3)/3! = (e^(-3)*27)/6 \u2248 (0.0498*27)/6 \u2248 0.2245. \n\nSo, the numerator is 0.2245 * 0.2245 \u2248 0.0505.\n\nNow, the denominator is P(total=5). Since the total in 30 minutes is the sum of two independent Poisson variables each with \u03bb=3. The probability mass function for the sum of two Poisson variables is given by the convolution. The PMF for the sum of two Poisson(\u03bb) variables is P(k; 2\u03bb) = \u03a3_{i=0}^k P(i; \u03bb) * P(k - i; \u03bb). \n\nSo, for k=5, P(5;6) = \u03a3_{i=0}^5 P(i;3) * P(5 - i;3). \n\nCalculating each term:\n\ni=0: P(0;3)*P(5;3) = (e^(-3)*3^0)/0! * (e^(-3)*3^5)/5! \u2248 (0.0498 *1)/1 * (0.0498 *243)/120 \u2248 0.0498 * (0.01209) \u2248 0.000599\n\ni=1: P(1;3)*P(4;3) = (e^(-3)*3)/1! * (e^(-3)*3^4)/4! \u2248 (0.0498*3)/1 * (0.0498*81)/24 \u2248 0.1494 * (0.00405) \u2248 0.000603\n\ni=2: P(2;3)*P(3;3) = (e^(-3)*9)/2 * (e^(-3)*27)/6 \u2248 (0.2245) * (0.2245) \u2248 0.0505\n\ni=3: P(3;3)*P(2;3) = same as i=2, so 0.0505\n\ni=4: P(4;3)*P(1;3) = same as i=1, so 0.000603\n\ni=5: P(5;3)*P(0;3) = same as i=0, so 0.000599\n\nAdding all these up: 0.000599 + 0.000603 + 0.0505 + 0.0505 + 0.000603 + 0.000599 \u2248 0.2032.\n\nSo, P(total=5) \u2248 0.2032.\n\nTherefore, the conditional probability is numerator / denominator \u2248 0.0505 / 0.2032 \u2248 0.248.\n\nSo, approximately 24.8% chance.\n\nWait, let me double-check the calculations. Maybe I made an error in the sum.\n\nWait, when I calculated the terms:\n\ni=0: \u22480.000599\n\ni=1: \u22480.000603\n\ni=2: \u22480.0505\n\ni=3: \u22480.0505\n\ni=4: \u22480.000603\n\ni=5: \u22480.000599\n\nAdding these: 0.000599 + 0.000603 = 0.001202; 0.001202 + 0.0505 = 0.051702; +0.0505 = 0.102202; +0.000603 = 0.102805; +0.000599 \u2248 0.103404.\n\nWait, that's different from what I had before. So, total P(5;6) \u2248 0.103404.\n\nSo, then the conditional probability is 0.0505 / 0.103404 \u2248 0.488, which is about 48.8%.\n\nWait, that's a significant difference. I think I messed up the earlier addition. Let me recalculate the sum properly.\n\nCalculating each term accurately:\n\ni=0: P(0;3)*P(5;3) = (e^(-3) * 1) * (e^(-3) * 243)/120 = (0.049787 * 0.049787 * 243)/120.\n\nWait, that's a bit messy. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the formula for the sum of two Poisson variables.\n\nThe probability mass function for the sum of two independent Poisson(\u03bb) variables is P(k; 2\u03bb) = \u03a3_{i=0}^k C(2\u03bb + k - 1, k - i) * (\u03bb^i * e^(-2\u03bb)).\n\nBut that might be more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps using generating functions or another method.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the formula for the convolution of two Poisson distributions. The probability that the sum is k is \u03a3_{i=0}^k P(i; \u03bb) * P(k - i; \u03bb).\n\nSo, for \u03bb=3 and k=5, we have:\n\nP(5;6) = \u03a3_{i=0}^5 P(i;3) * P(5 - i;3)\n\nCalculating each term:\n\ni=0: P(0;3)*P(5;3) = (e^(-3) * 3^0 / 0! ) * (e^(-3) * 3^5 / 5!) = (0.049787 * 1) * (0.049787 * 243 / 120) \u2248 0.049787 * (0.012065) \u2248 0.000599.\n\ni=1: P(1;3)*P(4;3) = (e^(-3) * 3^1 / 1! ) * (e^(-3) * 3^4 / 4!) = (0.049787 * 3) * (0.049787 * 81 / 24) \u2248 0.149361 * (0.00405) \u2248 0.000603.\n\ni=2: P(2;3)*P(3;3) = (e^(-3) * 9 / 2) * (e^(-3) * 27 / 6) \u2248 (0.2245) * (0.2245) \u2248 0.0505.\n\ni=3: Same as i=2 because of symmetry, so another 0.0505.\n\ni=4: Same as i=1, so 0.000603.\n\ni=5: Same as i=0, so 0.000599.\n\nAdding them up: 0.000599 + 0.000603 + 0.0505 + 0.0505 + 0.000603 + 0.000599.\n\nLet me add step by step:\n\nStart with 0.000599 + 0.000603 = 0.001202\n\n+ 0.0505 = 0.051702\n\n+ 0.0505 = 0.102202\n\n+ 0.000603 = 0.102805\n\n+ 0.000599 = 0.103404.\n\nSo, total P(5;6) \u2248 0.103404.\n\nTherefore, the conditional probability is 0.0505 / 0.103404 \u2248 0.488, or 48.8%.\n\nWait, that seems more reasonable. So, the probability that exactly 2 arrived in the first 15 minutes given that 5 arrived in the first 30 minutes is approximately 48.8%.\n\nBut let me think again. Since the process is Poisson, and the two 15-minute intervals are independent, the conditional probability is the probability that in the first 15 minutes there are 2 customers, and in the second 15 minutes there are 3, given that the total is 5.\n\nSo, the joint probability is P(2 in first 15) * P(3 in second 15) = (e^(-3) * 3^2 / 2!) * (e^(-3) * 3^3 / 3!) = (0.2245) * (0.2245) \u2248 0.0505.\n\nAnd the total probability of 5 in 30 minutes is approximately 0.1034.\n\nSo, 0.0505 / 0.1034 \u2248 0.488, which is about 48.8%.\n\nSo, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if I should have used \u03bb=3 for both intervals. Yes, because each 15-minute interval has a rate of 0.2 per minute, so \u03bb=0.2*15=3.\n\nSo, yes, the calculations are correct.\n\nTherefore, the answers are approximately:\n\n(a) 0.0011 or 0.109%.\n\n(b) Approximately 48.8%.\n\nBut let me express them more accurately.\n\nFor part (a), using more precise values:\n\ne^(-0.2) \u2248 0.818730753\n\n(0.2)^3 = 0.008\n\nSo, P(3;0.2) = (0.818730753 * 0.008) / 6 \u2248 (0.006550984) / 6 \u2248 0.001091647, which is approximately 0.0011 or 0.109%.\n\nFor part (b), more accurately, P(2 in first 15 | total 5) \u2248 0.488, or 48.8%.\n\nSo, that's the solution.\n</think>\n\n(a) The probability is approximately 0.0011, or 0.109%.\n\n(b) The probability is approximately 0.488, or 48.8%.\n\nDONE."

End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: A small local bakery receives customers according to a Poisson process with a rate of 12 customers per hour. The bakery opens at 8:00 AM. \n\n(a) What is the probability that the bakery receives exactly 3 customers in the first 15 minutes of operation?\n\n(b) Given that 5 customers arrived during the first half hour, what is the probability that exactly 2 of them arrived during the first 15 minutes? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I've got this problem about a bakery that gets customers according to a Poisson process. Let me try to wrap my head around it step by step. \n\nFirst, the problem says the bakery opens at 8:00 AM and customers arrive at a rate of 12 per hour. That means, on average, the bakery gets 12 customers every hour. Now, part (a) is asking for the probability that they receive exactly 3 customers in the first 15 minutes of operation. Hmm, okay, 15 minutes is a quarter of an hour, right? So, if the rate is 12 customers per hour, then in 15 minutes, the expected number of customers should be 12 divided by 4, which is 3. That's interesting because the expected number is exactly 3, but the question is about the probability of exactly 3 customers. \n\nI remember that the Poisson distribution is used to model the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space. The formula for the Poisson probability mass function is:\n\n\\[ P(k) = \\frac{e^{-\\lambda} \\cdot \\lambda^k}{k!} \\]\n\nWhere \\( \\lambda \\) is the average rate (the expected value) multiplied by the time interval. In this case, the time interval is 15 minutes, which is 0.25 hours. So, the average number of customers in 15 minutes is \\( \\lambda = 12 \\times 0.25 = 3 \\). \n\nSo, plugging into the formula, the probability of exactly 3 customers is:\n\n\\[ P(3) = \\frac{e^{-3} \\cdot 3^3}{3!} \\]\n\nCalculating that, let me see. First, \\( e^{-3} \\) is approximately 0.0498. Then, \\( 3^3 \\) is 27. Divided by 3! which is 6. So, 27 divided by 6 is 4.5. Multiply that by 0.0498, which gives approximately 0.2249. So, about 22.49% chance. \n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations. \\( e^{-3} \\) is correct? Yes, that's roughly 0.0498. \\( 3^3 \\) is 27, and 3! is 6, so 27/6 is indeed 4.5. Multiplying 4.5 by 0.0498: 4.5 * 0.0498. Hmm, 4 * 0.0498 is 0.1992, and 0.5 * 0.0498 is 0.0249, so total is 0.2241. Yeah, so approximately 0.224. So, 22.4% chance.\n\nOkay, that seems straightforward for part (a). Now, moving on to part (b). It says, given that 5 customers arrived during the first half hour, what is the probability that exactly 2 of them arrived during the first 15 minutes. Hmm, so this is a conditional probability problem. \n\nFirst, let me parse the problem. We have the bakery operating for half an hour, and in that half hour, 5 customers arrived. Given that, what's the probability that exactly 2 arrived in the first 15 minutes. So, we need to find the conditional probability \\( P(2 \\text{ in first 15 minutes} | 5 \\text{ in first 30 minutes}) \\).\n\nI remember that for conditional probability, the formula is:\n\n\\[ P(A|B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)} \\]\n\nBut in this case, since A is a subset of B (if 2 arrived in the first 15 minutes, then 5 arrived in the first 30 minutes), so \\( A \\cap B = A \\). Therefore, the conditional probability simplifies to:\n\n\\[ P(2 | 5) = \\frac{P(2)}{P(5)} \\]\n\nBut wait, is that correct? Let me think. Actually, it's not exactly that because the Poisson process is over a period. So, the number of customers in the first 15 minutes and the next 15 minutes are dependent events. So, the total number in 30 minutes is the sum of the first 15 minutes and the second 15 minutes.\n\nLet me define:\n\nLet \\( X \\) be the number of customers in the first 15 minutes. Then, \\( Y \\) be the number in the next 15 minutes. Since the Poisson process has independent increments, \\( X \\) and \\( Y \\) are independent Poisson random variables with parameters \\( \\lambda_1 = 3 \\) and \\( \\lambda_2 = 3 \\).\n\nSo, \\( X \\sim \\text{Poisson}(3) \\) and \\( Y \\sim \\text{Poisson}(3) \\). Then, \\( X + Y \\sim \\text{Poisson}(6) \\).\n\nGiven that \\( X + Y = 5 \\), we want to find \\( P(X = 2) \\). So, the conditional probability \\( P(X=2 | X+Y=5) \\).\n\nUsing the definition of conditional probability:\n\n\\[ P(X=2 | X+Y=5) = \\frac{P(X=2, X+Y=5)}{P(X+Y=5)} \\]\n\nBut since \\( X \\) and \\( Y \\) are independent, \\( P(X=2, X+Y=5) = P(X=2) \\cdot P(Y=3) \\) because if \\( X=2 \\), then \\( Y=5-2=3 \\).\n\nSo, substituting:\n\n\\[ P(X=2 | X+Y=5) = \\frac{P(X=2) \\cdot P(Y=3)}{P(X+Y=5)} \\]\n\nWe can compute each part.\n\nFirst, \\( P(X=2) = \\frac{e^{-3} \\cdot 3^2}{2!} = \\frac{e^{-3} \\cdot 9}{2} \\approx \\frac{0.0498 \\cdot 9}{2} \\approx \\frac{0.4482}{2} = 0.2241 \\).\n\nSimilarly, \\( P(Y=3) = \\frac{e^{-3} \\cdot 3^3}{3!} = \\frac{e^{-3} \\cdot 27}{6} \\approx \\frac{0.0498 \\cdot 27}{6} \\approx \\frac{1.3466}{6} \\approx 0.2243 \\).\n\nNow, \\( P(X+Y=5) \\) is the probability that the total number of customers in 30 minutes is 5. Since \\( X \\) and \\( Y \\) are independent Poisson variables with \\( \\lambda=3 \\) each, the sum \\( X+Y \\) is Poisson with \\( \\lambda=6 \\). So, \\( P(X+Y=5) = \\frac{e^{-6} \\cdot 6^5}{5!} \\).\n\nCalculating that:\n\nFirst, \\( e^{-6} \\approx 0.002479 \\).\n\n\\( 6^5 = 7776 \\).\n\n\\( 5! = 120 \\).\n\nSo, \\( P(X+Y=5) = \\frac{0.002479 \\cdot 7776}{120} \\).\n\nLet's compute numerator: 0.002479 * 7776 \u2248 19.31.\n\nThen, 19.31 / 120 \u2248 0.1617.\n\nSo, approximately 16.17% chance.\n\nTherefore, the conditional probability is:\n\n\\[ P(X=2 | X+Y=5) = \\frac{0.2241 \\cdot 0.2243}{0.1617} \\approx \\frac{0.0504}{0.1617} \\approx 0.3115 \\]\n\nSo, approximately 31.15% chance.\n\nWait, let me verify that. So, the numerator is P(X=2) * P(Y=3) \u2248 0.2241 * 0.2243 \u2248 0.0504. The denominator is P(X+Y=5) \u2248 0.1617. So, 0.0504 / 0.1617 \u2248 0.3115, which is about 31.15%.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to compute this. Since \\( X \\) and \\( Y \\) are independent, the conditional probability can also be thought of as the probability that \\( X=2 \\) given that \\( X + Y=5 \\). So, in the 30 minutes, 5 customers came, and we want the probability that exactly 2 were in the first 15 minutes. \n\nAlternatively, we can model this as a joint probability. The joint distribution of \\( X \\) and \\( Y \\) is:\n\n\\[ P(X=k, Y=m) = \\frac{e^{-6} \\cdot 6^{k+m}}{k! m!} \\]\n\nSo, for \\( k=2 \\) and \\( m=3 \\), the joint probability is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{e^{-6} \\cdot 6^{5}}{2! 3!} = \\frac{0.002479 \\cdot 7776}{2 \\cdot 6} = \\frac{19.31}{12} \u2248 1.6108 \\]\n\nWait, but that's the joint probability, which is the same as P(X=2, Y=3) \u2248 1.6108. But since we're dealing with probabilities, we need to normalize by P(X+Y=5) \u2248 0.1617. So, the conditional probability is 1.6108 / 0.1617 \u2248 9.96, which can't be right because probabilities can't exceed 1. Hmm, so I must have messed up the scaling.\n\nWait, no, actually, the joint probability is 1.6108, which is over the entire probability space. But when we condition on \\( X + Y =5 \\), we have to consider the probabilities within that conditional space. So, actually, P(X=2 | X+Y=5) is equal to P(X=2, Y=3) / P(X+Y=5). \n\nBut since the joint distribution is P(X=k, Y=m) = e^{-6} 6^{k+m} / (k! m!), the total P(X+Y=5) is the sum over k=0 to 5 of P(X=k, Y=5-k). So, in our case, we have P(X=2, Y=3) \u2248 1.6108, and P(X+Y=5) \u2248 0.1617, so 1.6108 / 0.1617 \u2248 9.96, which is greater than 1. That can't be. \n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. I must have messed up the scaling. Wait, no, actually, the joint probabilities sum to 1 for the entire distribution, but when conditioning, the conditional probabilities are scaled by P(X+Y=5). So, P(X=2 | X+Y=5) is just P(X=2, Y=3) divided by P(X+Y=5). But in reality, P(X=2, Y=3) is equal to P(X=2) * P(Y=3) because they're independent. So, 0.2241 * 0.2243 \u2248 0.0504, and P(X+Y=5) \u2248 0.1617, so 0.0504 / 0.1617 \u2248 0.3115, which is about 0.3115. So, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that, given 5 customers in 30 minutes, the probability that exactly 2 are in the first 15 minutes is the same as the probability that in 30 minutes, 5 come and 2 are in the first half. Since the process is memoryless, the distribution of arrivals in the first 15 minutes and the next 15 minutes are independent. So, the probability that 2 arrive in the first 15 minutes is P(X=2) * P(Y=3) divided by P(X+Y=5). So, same as before.\n\nSo, I think the answer is approximately 0.3115, which is about 31.15%.\n\nWait, let me double-check the calculations numerically.\n\nCompute P(X=2): e^{-3} * 3^2 / 2! \u2248 0.0498 * 9 / 2 \u2248 0.0498 * 4.5 \u2248 0.2241.\n\nCompute P(Y=3): e^{-3} * 3^3 / 6 \u2248 0.0498 * 27 / 6 \u2248 0.0498 * 4.5 \u2248 0.2243.\n\nCompute P(X+Y=5): e^{-6} * 6^5 / 5! \u2248 0.002479 * 7776 / 120 \u2248 (0.002479 * 7776) / 120 \u2248 19.31 / 120 \u2248 0.1617.\n\nSo, P(X=2 | X+Y=5) = (0.2241 * 0.2243) / 0.1617 \u2248 (0.0504) / 0.1617 \u2248 0.3115.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, approximately 31.15% chance.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as a hypergeometric distribution, but I don't think that applies here because the Poisson process is continuous and independent. So, the conditional probability is better calculated using the joint and marginal probabilities as I did.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\n(a) The probability of exactly 3 customers in the first 15 minutes is approximately 0.2249 or 22.49%.\n\n(b) Given 5 customers in the first half hour, the probability that exactly 2 arrived in the first 15 minutes is approximately 0.3115 or 31.15%.\n\nI think that's it. Let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.\n\nFor part (a):\n\n\u03bb = 3, k=3.\n\nP(3) = e^{-3} * 3^3 / 3! \u2248 0.0498 * 27 / 6 \u2248 0.2241. Wait, earlier I said 0.2249, but now it's 0.2241. Which is correct?\n\nWait, e^{-3} is approximately 0.049787, so more precisely:\n\ne^{-3} \u2248 0.049787.\n\n3^3 = 27.\n\n3! = 6.\n\nSo, 0.049787 * 27 = 1.344.\n\n1.344 / 6 \u2248 0.224.\n\nYes, so 0.224, not 0.2249. So, my initial approximation was a bit off, but it's about 0.224.\n\nSimilarly, for part (b), the calculations are more precise, but the result is approximately 0.3115.\n\nSo, final answers:\n\n(a) Approximately 0.224 or 22.4%\n\n(b) Approximately 0.3115 or 31.15%\n\nI think that's it.\n</think>\n\n(a) The probability that the bakery receives exactly 3 customers in the first 15 minutes is calculated using the Poisson probability mass function with \u03bb = 3. \n\n\\[ P(3) = \\frac{e^{-3} \\cdot 3^3}{3!} \\approx 0.224 \\]\n\n(b) Given that 5 customers arrived in the first half hour, the conditional probability that exactly 2 arrived in the first 15 minutes is found by considering the joint and marginal probabilities of the Poisson process over two independent 15-minute intervals.\n\n\\[ P(2 | 5) = \\frac{P(X=2) \\cdot P(Y=3)}{P(X+Y=5)} \\approx 0.3115 \\]\n\nDONE."

End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: A small local bakery receives customers according to a Poisson process with a rate of 12 customers per hour. The bakery opens at 8:00 AM. \n\n(a) What is the probability that the bakery receives exactly 3 customers in the first 15 minutes of operation?\n\n(b) Given that 5 customers arrived during the first half hour, what is the probability that exactly 2 of them arrived during the first 15 minutes? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this problem about a Poisson process at a bakery. Let me try to work through it step by step. I remember that a Poisson process is a way to model the number of events happening in a fixed interval of time, like customers arriving at a bakery. The rate here is 12 customers per hour. \n\nStarting with part (a): What is the probability that the bakery receives exactly 3 customers in the first 15 minutes of operation?\n\nFirst, I need to recall the formula for the Poisson probability mass function. It's given by P(k) = (\u03bb^k * e^(-\u03bb)) / k!, where \u03bb is the average rate (the expected number of occurrences in a given time period). \n\nBut wait, the rate is given per hour, which is 60 minutes. Since we're dealing with the first 15 minutes, I need to adjust the rate accordingly. So, the rate for 15 minutes would be \u03bb = 12 customers per hour * (15/60) hours = 3 customers per 15 minutes. \n\nSo, \u03bb for the first 15 minutes is 3. We want the probability of exactly 3 customers, so k = 3.\n\nPlugging into the formula: P(3) = (3^3 * e^(-3)) / 3! \n\nCalculating that:\n\n3^3 is 27.\n\ne^(-3) is approximately 0.0498.\n\n3! is 6.\n\nSo, P(3) \u2248 (27 * 0.0498) / 6.\n\nCalculating the numerator: 27 * 0.0498 \u2248 1.3416.\n\nDivide by 6: 1.3416 / 6 \u2248 0.2236.\n\nSo, approximately 22.36% chance.\n\nWait, let me double-check the calculations.\n\n\u03bb is indeed 12 * (15/60) = 3. That's correct.\n\nP(3) = (3^3 * e^(-3)) / 6.\n\nCalculating 3^3: 27.\n\ne^(-3) \u2248 0.049787.\n\nSo, 27 * 0.049787 \u2248 1.3406.\n\nDivide by 6: 1.3406 / 6 \u2248 0.2234.\n\nSo, approximately 0.2234, which is about 22.34%.\n\nRounding to four decimal places, 0.2234.\n\nSo, the probability is approximately 0.2234.\n\nMoving on to part (b): Given that 5 customers arrived during the first half hour, what is the probability that exactly 2 of them arrived during the first 15 minutes?\n\nHmm, this seems like a conditional probability. So, we know that in the first 30 minutes, there were exactly 5 customers. We need the probability that exactly 2 of these 5 arrived in the first 15 minutes.\n\nI think this is a case where we can use the binomial distribution because we're looking at successes (customers) in a subset of trials (the first half hour). But wait, actually, since the Poisson process has independent increments, the number of customers in the first 15 minutes and the next 15 minutes should be independent. \n\nSo, given that in the first 30 minutes, there are 5 customers, the number of customers in the first 15 minutes and the second 15 minutes are independent Poisson variables with \u03bb = 3 each.\n\nBut we need the probability that exactly 2 arrived in the first 15 minutes, given that 5 arrived in the first 30 minutes. \n\nThis is equivalent to the conditional probability P(exactly 2 in first 15 | total 5 in first 30).\n\nSince the two 15-minute periods are independent, the number in the first 15 is independent of the number in the second 15.\n\nSo, the probability that exactly 2 arrived in the first 15 minutes is equal to the probability that exactly 2 arrived in the first 15 minutes, and then exactly 3 arrived in the second 15 minutes.\n\nTherefore, P(2 in first 15 and 3 in second 15) = P(2 in first 15) * P(3 in second 15).\n\nSince the two are independent.\n\nSo, P(2) = (3^2 * e^(-3)) / 2! = (9 * e^(-3)) / 2 \u2248 (9 * 0.049787) / 2 \u2248 (0.449) / 2 \u2248 0.2245.\n\nSimilarly, P(3) = (3^3 * e^(-3)) / 3! = (27 * 0.049787) / 6 \u2248 (1.340) / 6 \u2248 0.2233.\n\nMultiplying these together: 0.2245 * 0.2233 \u2248 0.0503.\n\nSo, approximately 0.0503.\n\nAlternatively, since the total is 5, and the two periods are independent, the probability that exactly 2 arrived in the first 15 is equal to the probability mass function of the conditional distribution given the total.\n\nBut another way to think about it is that, given the total number of customers in the first 30 minutes is 5, and the two 15-minute intervals are independent, the conditional probability is the same as the probability that in the first 15 minutes, it's 2, and the second is 3.\n\nWhich is what I did.\n\nSo, the probability is approximately 0.0503.\n\nWait, let me verify this approach.\n\nAlternatively, since the two periods are independent, the conditional probability can be calculated by considering the joint probability.\n\nSo, P(2 in first 15, 3 in second 15) / P(total 5 in first 30).\n\nBut since the two periods are independent, P(total 5) is the sum over k=0 to 5 of P(k in first 15) * P(5 - k in second 15).\n\nBut in our case, we're given that the total is 5, and we want the probability that exactly 2 were in the first 15.\n\nSo, the conditional probability is P(2 in first 15 and 3 in second 15) / P(total 5).\n\nBut since the two are independent, P(2 and 3) = P(2) * P(3). \n\nAnd P(total 5) is the sum from k=0 to 5 of P(k) * P(5 - k).\n\nBut wait, let's compute P(total 5):\n\nP(total 5) = sum_{k=0 to 5} P(k in first 15) * P(5 - k in second 15).\n\nBut since the two are independent, this is sum_{k=0 to 5} [ (3^k e^{-3}) / k! ] * [ (3^{5 - k} e^{-3}) / (5 - k)! ) ].\n\nWhich simplifies to sum_{k=0 to 5} (3^5 e^{-6}) / (k! (5 - k)! )).\n\nBut 3^5 = 243, and e^{-6} is a constant.\n\nSo, it's e^{-6} * sum_{k=0 to 5} (243) / (k! (5 - k)! )).\n\nBut wait, the sum is over the binomial coefficients, which is equal to (1 + 1)^5 = 32. Wait, no, that's for (1 + 1)^5. But in our case, it's (3 + 3)^5 / (something). Wait, no, actually, the sum is the same as (3 + 3)^5 / (5! ), but no, that's not exactly it.\n\nWait, actually, the sum is sum_{k=0 to 5} (3^k * 3^{5 - k}) / (k! (5 - k)! )) = sum_{k=0 to 5} 3^5 / (k! (5 - k)! )) = 3^5 * sum_{k=0 to 5} 1 / (k! (5 - k)! )).\n\nBut the sum is equal to (1 + 1)^5 = 32, but multiplied by 3^5. Wait, no, that's not correct.\n\nWait, actually, the sum is equal to the number of ways to arrange 5 items with k in the first 15 minutes and 5 - k in the second. But since the two are independent, it's just the total number of ways, which is sum_{k=0 to 5} [ (3^k / k! ) * (3^{5 - k} / (5 - k)! ) ].\n\nWhich is equal to (3 + 3)^5 / 5! = 6^5 / 5! = 7776 / 120 = 64.8.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because 3 + 3 is 6, and (6)^5 = 7776, divided by 5! = 120, gives 64.8.\n\nSo, P(total 5) = e^{-6} * 64.8 \u2248 e^{-6} * 64.8 \u2248 0.002479 * 64.8 \u2248 0.161.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought P(2 and 3) is 0.2245 * 0.2233 \u2248 0.0503.\n\nSo, the conditional probability is 0.0503 / 0.161 \u2248 0.313.\n\nWait, that contradicts my earlier approach. So, which is correct?\n\nI think I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify.\n\nThe correct approach is that given the total number of customers in the first 30 minutes is 5, the probability that exactly 2 arrived in the first 15 minutes is equal to the probability that in the first 15 minutes, 2 arrived, and in the second 15 minutes, 3 arrived. Since the two periods are independent, the joint probability is the product of the individual probabilities.\n\nBut the conditional probability is P(2 in first 15 | total 5) = P(2 in first 15 and 3 in second 15) / P(total 5).\n\nSo, P(2 and 3) = P(2) * P(3) \u2248 0.2245 * 0.2233 \u2248 0.0503.\n\nP(total 5) = sum_{k=0 to 5} P(k in first 15) * P(5 - k in second 15).\n\nAs I calculated earlier, P(total 5) \u2248 e^{-6} * 64.8 \u2248 0.161.\n\nTherefore, the conditional probability is 0.0503 / 0.161 \u2248 0.313.\n\nSo, approximately 31.3%.\n\nBut wait, that seems different from my initial thought. So, which is correct?\n\nLet me compute it more accurately.\n\nCompute P(2 in first 15) = (3^2 e^{-3}) / 2! = (9 * e^{-3}) / 2 \u2248 (9 * 0.049787) / 2 \u2248 (0.449) / 2 \u2248 0.2245.\n\nP(3 in second 15) = (3^3 e^{-3}) / 3! = (27 * e^{-3}) / 6 \u2248 (1.340) / 6 \u2248 0.2233.\n\nSo, P(2 and 3) = 0.2245 * 0.2233 \u2248 0.0503.\n\nNow, P(total 5) = sum_{k=0 to 5} P(k in first 15) * P(5 - k in second 15).\n\nLet's compute each term:\n\nFor k=0: P(0) * P(5) = (e^{-3}) * (3^5 e^{-3} / 5!) = e^{-6} * (243 / 120) \u2248 0.002479 * 2.025 \u2248 0.00503.\n\nk=1: P(1) * P(4) = (3 e^{-3}) * (3^4 e^{-3} / 4!) = e^{-6} * (3 * 81 / 24) = e^{-6} * (243 / 24) \u2248 0.002479 * 10.125 \u2248 0.02515.\n\nk=2: P(2) * P(3) = 0.2245 * 0.2233 \u2248 0.0503.\n\nk=3: P(3) * P(2) = same as k=2, \u22480.0503.\n\nk=4: P(4) * P(1) = same as k=1, \u22480.02515.\n\nk=5: P(5) * P(0) = same as k=0, \u22480.00503.\n\nSo, summing all these:\n\n0.00503 + 0.02515 + 0.0503 + 0.0503 + 0.02515 + 0.00503 \u2248\n\n0.00503*2 = 0.01006\n\n0.02515*2 = 0.0503\n\n0.0503*2 = 0.1006\n\nTotal \u2248 0.01006 + 0.0503 + 0.1006 \u2248 0.161.\n\nSo, P(total 5) \u2248 0.161.\n\nTherefore, the conditional probability is 0.0503 / 0.161 \u2248 0.313.\n\nSo, approximately 31.3%.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought it was 0.0503, but that's the joint probability, not the conditional. So, the correct answer is approximately 0.313.\n\nBut let me think again. Is there another way to approach this?\n\nAlternatively, given that the total number in the first 30 minutes is 5, and the two intervals are independent, the number in the first 15 minutes is a Poisson variable with \u03bb=3, and the number in the second 15 minutes is also Poisson with \u03bb=3, independent of the first.\n\nTherefore, the conditional probability that exactly 2 arrived in the first 15 minutes is equal to the probability mass function of a Poisson(3) at k=2.\n\nBut wait, that can't be right because the total is 5. Wait, no, because the total is 5, it's not just Poisson(3) anymore because it's conditioned on the total.\n\nWait, actually, the number in the first 15 minutes is independent of the number in the second 15 minutes. So, the conditional distribution given the total is not Poisson anymore, it's a binomial distribution.\n\nWait, no, the conditional distribution isn't binomial because the trials are independent Poisson processes.\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to clarify.\n\nThe number of customers in the first 15 minutes, say X, follows Poisson(3). The number in the second 15 minutes, Y, follows Poisson(3), independent of X.\n\nGiven that X + Y = 5, we want P(X=2 | X + Y =5).\n\nSince X and Y are independent, the conditional distribution of X given X + Y =5 is the same as the distribution of X when X can be 0,1,2,3,4,5, but constrained by Y=5 - X.\n\nSo, the probability mass function of X given X + Y=5 is:\n\nP(X=k | X + Y=5) = P(X=k, Y=5 -k) / P(X + Y=5).\n\nWhich is (P(k) * P(5 -k)) / P(5).\n\nWhich is exactly what I did earlier.\n\nSo, P(X=2 | X + Y=5) = P(2 and 3) / P(5) \u2248 0.0503 / 0.161 \u2248 0.313.\n\nSo, approximately 0.313.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that the conditional distribution of X given X + Y=5 is equivalent to a binomial distribution with n=2 and p=0.5, but that's not accurate because the Poisson variables aren't Bernoulli trials.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. The sum of two independent Poisson variables is a Poisson variable with \u03bb=6, but when conditioning on the sum being 5, the conditional distribution isn't Poisson anymore.\n\nSo, the correct approach is to compute the conditional probability as the joint probability divided by the marginal probability.\n\nTherefore, the probability is approximately 0.313.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\n(a) Approximately 0.2234.\n\n(b) Approximately 0.313.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.\n\nFor part (a):\n\n\u03bb = 3.\n\nP(3) = (3^3 e^{-3}) / 3! = (27 * e^{-3}) / 6.\n\nCompute 27 / 6 = 4.5.\n\ne^{-3} \u2248 0.049787.\n\n4.5 * 0.049787 \u2248 0.2234.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nFor part (b):\n\nP(2 and 3) = P(2) * P(3) \u2248 0.2245 * 0.2233 \u2248 0.0503.\n\nP(total 5) \u2248 0.161.\n\nSo, 0.0503 / 0.161 \u2248 0.313.\n\nYes, correct.\n</think>\n\n(a) The probability is approximately 0.2234.\n\n(b) The probability is approximately 0.313.\n\nDONE."

End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: A small local bakery receives customers according to a Poisson process with a rate of 12 customers per hour. The bakery opens at 8:00 AM. \n\n(a) What is the probability that the bakery receives exactly 3 customers in the first 15 minutes of operation?\n\n(b) Given that 5 customers arrived during the first half hour, what is the probability that exactly 2 of them arrived during the first 15 minutes? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I've got this problem about a bakery that gets customers according to a Poisson process. It sounds a bit technical, but I think I can figure it out. Let me start by understanding what a Poisson process is. From what I remember, a Poisson process is a continuous-time counting process that counts the number of events happening in a fixed interval of time. In this case, the events are customers arriving at the bakery.\n\nThe bakery opens at 8:00 AM, and customers arrive at a rate of 12 per hour. That means on average, 12 customers come in each hour. Now, part (a) of the problem asks for the probability that the bakery receives exactly 3 customers in the first 15 minutes of operation.\n\nOkay, so 15 minutes is a quarter of an hour. Since the rate is 12 customers per hour, the rate per minute would be 12 divided by 60, which is 0.2 customers per minute. Wait, actually, no, that's not quite right. Poisson processes are usually defined with a rate per unit time, so in this case, it's 12 customers per hour. But when calculating probabilities, we need the rate over the specific time interval we're interested in.\n\nSo for the first 15 minutes, the time interval is 15 minutes. The rate is 12 per hour, which is 12/60 = 0.2 per minute. So the expected number of customers in 15 minutes would be rate multiplied by time, which is 0.2 * 15 = 3. That's interesting because the question is asking for exactly 3 customers. So, it's asking for the Poisson probability mass function at k=3, where \u03bb is the expected value.\n\nThe Poisson probability mass function is given by P(k) = (e^(-\u03bb) * \u03bb^k) / k!. So in this case, \u03bb is 3. Let me write that down:\n\nP(3) = (e^(-3) * 3^3) / 3!\n\nCalculating that:\n\nFirst, 3! is 6. So, 3^3 is 27. So, 27 divided by 6 is 4.5. Then, e^(-3) is approximately 0.0498. Multiplying 4.5 by 0.0498 gives roughly 0.2245. So, about 22.45% chance.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations. Maybe I should use more precise numbers. e^(-3) is approximately 0.049787. So, 4.5 * 0.049787 is approximately 0.22409, which is about 22.4%. So, rounding it, maybe 22.4%.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Since the rate is 12 per hour, over 15 minutes, it's 12 * (15/60) = 3. So, yes, \u03bb=3. So, the PMF is as I calculated.\n\nMoving on to part (b). It says, given that 5 customers arrived during the first half hour, what is the probability that exactly 2 of them arrived during the first 15 minutes?\n\nHmm, okay, so this is a conditional probability. We're given that in the first half hour, 5 customers arrived, and we need to find the probability that exactly 2 of these arrived in the first 15 minutes.\n\nSo, in probability terms, this is P(exactly 2 in first 15 minutes | 5 in first half hour).\n\nUsing the formula for conditional probability, that's equal to P(exactly 2 in first 15 minutes and 5 in first half hour) divided by P(5 in first half hour).\n\nBut since if exactly 2 arrived in the first 15 minutes, then the remaining 3 must have arrived in the next 15 minutes. So, the joint probability is P(2 in first 15 and 3 in next 15). Since the Poisson process has independent increments, the number of arrivals in disjoint intervals are independent. So, this is P(2 in first 15) * P(3 in next 15).\n\nSo, P(2 | 5) = [P(2) * P(3)] / P(5).\n\nNow, let's compute each part.\n\nFirst, P(2) is the probability of exactly 2 customers in the first 15 minutes. As before, \u03bb is 3, so P(2) = (e^(-3) * 3^2) / 2! = (e^(-3) * 9) / 2 \u2248 (0.049787 * 9) / 2 \u2248 0.2245 / 2 \u2248 0.11225.\n\nSimilarly, P(3) is the probability of exactly 3 customers in the next 15 minutes, which is also \u03bb=3. So, P(3) = same as P(2), which is approximately 0.11225.\n\nSo, P(2 and 3) = 0.11225 * 0.11225 \u2248 0.01266.\n\nNow, P(5) is the probability of exactly 5 customers in the first half hour. The half hour is 30 minutes, so \u03bb for 30 minutes is 12 * 0.5 = 6. So, P(5) = (e^(-6) * 6^5) / 5!.\n\nCalculating that:\n\n6^5 is 7776. 5! is 120. So, 7776 / 120 = 64.8. Then, e^(-6) is approximately 0.002478752. Multiplying 64.8 by 0.002478752 \u2248 0.1607.\n\nSo, P(5) \u2248 0.1607.\n\nTherefore, P(2 | 5) \u2248 0.01266 / 0.1607 \u2248 0.0785, or 7.85%.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating P(2 and 3). Since the two intervals are independent, the joint probability is indeed the product of the individual probabilities. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about it as splitting the half hour into two 15-minute intervals. So, given that 5 arrived in total, what's the probability that 2 arrived in the first 15 and 3 in the second 15.\n\nYes, that's exactly what I did. So, the conditional probability is the product of the individual Poisson probabilities divided by the total probability.\n\nI think that's correct. So, to summarize:\n\nFor part (a), the probability is approximately 0.2241, and for part (b), given 5 in the first half hour, the probability that exactly 2 arrived in the first 15 minutes is approximately 0.0785.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculation for P(2 and 3). So, P(2 in first 15) is (e^(-3) * 3^2)/2 = (0.049787 * 9)/2 \u2248 0.2241 / 2 \u2248 0.11205. Similarly, P(3 in second 15) is same as P(2), so 0.11205. Multiplying them gives 0.11205 * 0.11205 \u2248 0.01257.\n\nThen, P(5) is (e^(-6) * 6^5)/5! = (0.002478752 * 7776)/120 \u2248 (19.23)/120 \u2248 0.16025.\n\nSo, 0.01257 / 0.16025 \u2248 0.07835, which is approximately 0.0784, so 7.84%.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the formula for conditional probability in Poisson processes. The process has independent increments, so given that in the first half hour, 5 arrived, the number in the first 15 minutes is a Poisson variable with \u03bb=3, and the number in the next 15 minutes is Poisson with \u03bb=3. So, the probability that exactly 2 arrived in the first 15 minutes is just the probability mass function of Poisson(3) at 2, which is 0.11225, but since we're given that exactly 5 arrived in 30 minutes, which is Poisson(6) at 5, the conditional probability is the ratio of the joint probability (which is the product of the two independent Poisson variables) to the marginal probability of the total.\n\nSo, yes, same result.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the answers would be approximately 0.2241 for part (a) and 0.0784 for part (b).\n\nWait, but let me check if I should use more precise values for e^(-3) and e^(-6). Maybe that affects the result.\n\ne^(-3) is approximately 0.049787, and e^(-6) is approximately 0.002478752.\n\nSo, for P(2), it's (0.049787 * 9)/2 = 0.049787 * 4.5 = 0.22409.\n\nSimilarly, P(3) is same as P(2), so 0.22409.\n\nSo, P(2 and 3) = 0.22409 * 0.22409 \u2248 0.05037.\n\nWait, no, wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, no, I think I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, no, wait. No, because P(2 in first 15) is 0.22409, and P(3 in second 15) is also 0.22409, so their product is 0.22409 * 0.22409 \u2248 0.05037.\n\nBut earlier, I thought it was 0.01266, but that was wrong because I did 0.11225 * 0.11225 \u2248 0.01266, but actually, the correct P(2) is 0.22409, not 0.11225.\n\nWait, no, wait, no, wait. Let me clarify.\n\nWait, in part (a), \u03bb is 3, so P(3) is (e^(-3) * 3^3)/3! = (0.049787 * 27)/6 \u2248 0.22409.\n\nBut in part (b), when considering 15 minutes, P(2) is (e^(-3) * 2^2)/2! = (0.049787 * 4)/2 \u2248 0.09979.\n\nWait, wait, no, wait. Wait, in part (a), we have exactly 3 in 15 minutes, so \u03bb=3.\n\nIn part (b), we're splitting the 30 minutes into two 15-minute intervals. So, in the first 15 minutes, \u03bb is 3, and in the second 15 minutes, \u03bb is also 3, because the rate is 12 per hour, so per 15 minutes, it's 3.\n\nSo, for the first 15 minutes, P(2) is (e^(-3) * 2^2)/2! = (0.049787 * 4)/2 \u2248 0.09979.\n\nSimilarly, P(3) in the second 15 minutes is same as P(2), which is 0.09979.\n\nSo, the joint probability P(2 and 3) is 0.09979 * 0.09979 \u2248 0.00996.\n\nThen, P(5) is the probability of exactly 5 in 30 minutes, which has \u03bb=6.\n\nSo, P(5) = (e^(-6) * 6^5)/5! = (0.002478752 * 7776)/120 \u2248 (19.23)/120 \u2248 0.16025.\n\nSo, the conditional probability is 0.00996 / 0.16025 \u2248 0.06195, which is approximately 6.2%.\n\nWait, now I'm confused because earlier I thought P(2) was 0.11225, but that was incorrect. Let me correct that.\n\nIn part (a), P(3) is 0.22409.\n\nIn part (b), when calculating P(2 in first 15), it's (e^(-3) * 2^2)/2! = (0.049787 * 4)/2 = 0.09979.\n\nSimilarly, P(3 in second 15) is same as P(2) in first 15, which is 0.09979.\n\nSo, their product is 0.09979 * 0.09979 \u2248 0.00996.\n\nThen, P(5) is 0.16025, so 0.00996 / 0.16025 \u2248 0.06195, which is approximately 6.2%.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 7.85%, but that was because I incorrectly used P(2) as 0.11225. So, which one is correct?\n\nWait, no, I think I made a mistake in part (a). Let me recast it.\n\nIn part (a), the question is about exactly 3 customers in 15 minutes. So, \u03bb is 3.\n\nSo, P(3) = (e^(-3) * 3^3)/3! = (0.049787 * 27)/6 \u2248 (1.341)/6 \u2248 0.2235.\n\nSo, approximately 22.35%.\n\nIn part (b), we're given that in 30 minutes, exactly 5 customers arrived. So, the number in the first 15 minutes can be 0,1,2,3,4,5, but since we need exactly 2 in the first 15, and 3 in the second 15, the joint probability is P(2) * P(3), where both are Poisson with \u03bb=3.\n\nSo, P(2) = (e^(-3) * 2^2)/2! = (0.049787 * 4)/2 \u2248 0.09979.\n\nSimilarly, P(3) is same, so 0.09979.\n\nThus, joint is 0.09979^2 \u2248 0.00996.\n\nP(5) is (e^(-6) * 6^5)/5! \u2248 0.16025.\n\nSo, conditional probability is 0.00996 / 0.16025 \u2248 0.06195, which is about 6.2%.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 7.85%, but that was because I incorrectly used P(2) as 0.11225, which was wrong. So, the correct answer is approximately 6.2%.\n\nWait, but I think I'm making a mistake here. Let me double-check the Poisson PMF.\n\nThe Poisson PMF is P(k) = (e^(-\u03bb) * \u03bb^k)/k!.\n\nSo, for k=2, \u03bb=3:\n\nP(2) = (e^(-3) * 9)/2 \u2248 0.049787 * 9 / 2 \u2248 0.22409 / 2 \u2248 0.11205.\n\nWait, wait, no, 0.049787 * 9 is 0.44703, divided by 2 is 0.22351, which is approximately 0.2235, not 0.11205. Wait, no, wait, no, 0.049787 * 9 = 0.44703, divided by 2 is 0.22351. So, P(2) is 0.2235, not 0.11205. So, I think I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, no, wait. No, the PMF is (e^(-\u03bb) * \u03bb^k)/k!.\n\nSo, for k=2, \u03bb=3:\n\nP(2) = (e^(-3) * 3^2)/2! = (0.049787 * 9)/2 \u2248 0.049787 * 4.5 \u2248 0.22351.\n\nSo, P(2) is approximately 0.2235, not 0.11205. So, my earlier calculation was wrong because I thought P(2) is 0.11225, but that's actually P(1), because P(1) = (e^(-3) * 3^1)/1! = 0.049787 * 3 \u2248 0.14936.\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, no, let me compute P(1) and P(2) correctly.\n\nP(0) = e^(-3) \u2248 0.049787.\n\nP(1) = (e^(-3) * 3^1)/1! \u2248 0.049787 * 3 \u2248 0.14936.\n\nP(2) = (e^(-3) * 3^2)/2! \u2248 0.049787 * 9 / 2 \u2248 0.22351.\n\nP(3) = (e^(-3) * 3^3)/3! \u2248 0.049787 * 27 / 6 \u2248 0.22351.\n\nWait, so P(3) is same as P(2), which makes sense because the Poisson distribution is symmetric around \u03bb when k=\u03bb, but in this case, \u03bb=3, and k=2 and 4 would be symmetric. Wait, no, actually, Poisson distribution isn't symmetric unless \u03bb=1.\n\nWait, no, wait, no. Poisson distribution isn't symmetric. It's skewed. But in this case, P(2) and P(3) are both around 0.2235, which is higher than P(1) and P(4), which are lower.\n\nWait, but regardless, for part (b), when we split the 30 minutes into two 15-minute intervals, each with \u03bb=3, the probability of 2 in the first 15 minutes is P(2) = 0.2235, and 3 in the second 15 minutes is also 0.2235.\n\nSo, the joint probability is 0.2235 * 0.2235 \u2248 0.0501.\n\nThen, P(5) is the probability of exactly 5 in 30 minutes, which is \u03bb=6.\n\nP(5) = (e^(-6) * 6^5)/5! \u2248 (0.002478752 * 7776)/120 \u2248 (19.23)/120 \u2248 0.16025.\n\nSo, the conditional probability is 0.0501 / 0.16025 \u2248 0.3125, which is 31.25%.\n\nWait, that's different from before. So, I think I made a mistake in calculating P(2) earlier.\n\nWait, let's clarify:\n\nIn part (b), given that 5 arrived in 30 minutes, we want the probability that exactly 2 arrived in the first 15 minutes and exactly 3 in the next "

    "solution": "Solve this problem step by step. End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: A small local bakery receives customers according to a Poisson process with a rate of 12 customers per hour. The bakery opens at 8:00 AM. \n\n(a) What is the probability that the bakery receives exactly 3 customers in the first 15 minutes of operation?\n\n(b) Given that 5 customers arrived during the first half hour, what is the probability that exactly 2 of them arrived during the first 15 minutes? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this problem about a bakery receiving customers according to a Poisson process. It's divided into two parts, (a) and (b). Let me try to figure them out step by step.\n\nStarting with part (a): What is the probability that the bakery receives exactly 3 customers in the first 15 minutes of operation?\n\nFirst, I remember that a Poisson process is a continuous-time process where events happen independently at a constant average rate. The rate here is given as 12 customers per hour. So, the rate per minute would be 12 divided by 60, which is 0.2 customers per minute.\n\nNow, the question is about the probability of exactly 3 customers arriving in the first 15 minutes. Since Poisson processes have the property that the number of events in disjoint intervals are independent, I can model this as a Poisson distribution.\n\nThe Poisson probability formula is:\n\nP(k) = (\u03bb^k * e^(-\u03bb)) / k!\n\nWhere:\n- P(k) is the probability of k events,\n- \u03bb is the average rate (expected number of events in the interval),\n- k is the number of occurrences.\n\nIn this case, the interval is 15 minutes. So, I need to calculate \u03bb for 15 minutes.\n\nGiven the rate is 0.2 customers per minute, over 15 minutes, \u03bb = 0.2 * 15 = 3.\n\nSo, \u03bb is 3. We want the probability of exactly 3 customers, so k=3.\n\nPlugging into the formula:\n\nP(3) = (3^3 * e^(-3)) / 3!\n\nCalculating that:\n\nFirst, 3^3 is 27.\n\ne^(-3) is approximately 0.049787.\n\n3! is 6.\n\nSo, P(3) = (27 * 0.049787) / 6.\n\nLet me compute 27 * 0.049787 first:\n\n27 * 0.049787 \u2248 1.3403.\n\nThen divide by 6:\n\n1.3403 / 6 \u2248 0.2234.\n\nSo, the probability is approximately 0.2234, or 22.34%.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check the calculations.\n\n\u03bb = 0.2 * 15 = 3. Correct.\n\nP(3) = (3^3 * e^(-3)) / 6.\n\n3^3 is indeed 27.\n\ne^(-3) \u2248 0.049787.\n\n27 * 0.049787 \u2248 1.3403.\n\n1.3403 / 6 \u2248 0.2234.\n\nHmm, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can use the Poisson table or calculator for \u03bb=3.\n\nLooking it up, the Poisson probability for k=3 is about 0.2231, which matches my calculation. So, 0.2231 is approximately 0.223, so 22.3%.\n\nTherefore, the probability is approximately 0.223.\n\nMoving on to part (b): Given that 5 customers arrived during the first half hour, what is the probability that exactly 2 of them arrived during the first 15 minutes?\n\nThis is a conditional probability problem. So, we're given that in the first half hour (30 minutes), there were exactly 5 customers. We need to find the probability that exactly 2 of these 5 arrived in the first 15 minutes.\n\nFirst, let me recall that in a Poisson process, the number of arrivals in any interval follows a Poisson distribution. Also, the arrivals in disjoint intervals are independent.\n\nSo, the first 15 minutes and the next 15 minutes (the second half of the first hour) are disjoint intervals. Since the process is Poisson, the number of arrivals in each interval is independent.\n\nGiven that the total in the first 30 minutes is 5, we can model this as a binomial distribution, where each 15-minute interval has a probability of 3 customers (since \u03bb=0.2*15=3) and the other interval also has \u03bb=3.\n\nWait, no, actually, the number of customers in the first 15 minutes is Poisson(3), and in the second 15 minutes is also Poisson(3). So, the total number in 30 minutes is Poisson(6), but conditioned on being exactly 5.\n\nSo, the conditional probability that exactly 2 arrived in the first 15 minutes given that 5 arrived in the first 30 minutes is equal to the probability that 2 arrived in the first 15 minutes and 3 arrived in the second 15 minutes.\n\nSince the two intervals are independent, the joint probability is the product of the individual probabilities.\n\nSo, P(2 in first 15 and 3 in second 15 | total 5) = P(2 in first 15 and 3 in second 15) / P(total 5).\n\nBut since the two intervals are independent, P(2 and 3) = P(2) * P(3).\n\nSo, let's compute P(2) in the first 15 minutes: Poisson(3) probability for 2.\n\nSimilarly, P(3) in the second 15 minutes: Poisson(3) probability for 3.\n\nThen, the numerator is P(2) * P(3).\n\nThe denominator is the probability that in 30 minutes, exactly 5 customers arrived, which is the same as the probability that in the first 15 minutes, k customers arrived, and in the second 15 minutes, (5 - k) customers arrived. So, the total probability is the sum over k=0 to 5 of [P(k) * P(5 - k)].\n\nBut since the process is Poisson, the number of arrivals in the second interval depends only on the first, so we can compute it as the convolution of two Poisson distributions, which results in a Poisson distribution with \u03bb=6. So, P(5) for \u03bb=6.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to compute the numerator and denominator separately.\n\nFirst, compute P(2 in first 15):\n\nP(2) = (3^2 * e^(-3)) / 2! = (9 * 0.049787) / 2 \u2248 (0.448) / 2 \u2248 0.224.\n\nWait, 3^2 is 9, 9 * e^(-3) \u2248 9 * 0.049787 \u2248 0.448.\n\nDivide by 2! = 2: 0.448 / 2 \u2248 0.224.\n\nSimilarly, P(3 in second 15) is the same, because \u03bb=3:\n\n(3^3 * e^(-3)) / 6 \u2248 (27 * 0.049787) / 6 \u2248 1.3403 / 6 \u2248 0.2234.\n\nSo, the numerator is 0.224 * 0.2234 \u2248 0.0503.\n\nNow, the denominator is P(total 5). Since the total is 30 minutes, which is \u03bb=6, P(5) for \u03bb=6.\n\nCompute P(5) = (6^5 * e^(-6)) / 5!.\n\nCalculate 6^5: 6*6=36, 36*6=216, 216*6=1296, 1296*6=7776.\n\nWait, no: 6^5 is 6*6=36, 36*6=216, 216*6=1296, 1296*6=7776.

Alternatively, perhaps a better way is to compute 7776 * 0.002478752.\n\nCompute 7776 * 0.002 = 15.552.\n\n7776 * 0.000478752 \u2248 Let's compute 7776 * 0.0004 = 3.1104, and 7776 * 0.000078752 \u2248 7776 * 0.00007 = 0.54432, and 7776 * 0.000008752 \u2248 ~0.0682.\n\nSo, adding up: 3.1104 + 0.54432 + 0.0682 \u2248 3.72292.\n\nSo, total \u2248 15.552 + 3.72292 \u2248 19.2749.\n\nNow, divide by 120: 19.2749 / 120 \u2248 0.160623.\n\nSo, P(5) \u2248 0.1606.\n\nTherefore, the conditional probability is numerator / denominator \u2248 0.0503 / 0.1606 \u2248 0.3135, or 31.35%.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me check if I did the calculations correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for conditional probability in Poisson processes.\n\nSince the arrivals in the first 15 minutes and the second 15 minutes are independent, given that the total in 30 minutes is 5, the probability that exactly 2 arrived in the first 15 minutes is equal to [P(2 in first 15) * P(3 in second 15)] / P(5 in 30 minutes).\n\nWhich is exactly what I did.\n\nSo, P(2) \u2248 0.224, P(3) \u2248 0.223, so 0.224*0.223 \u2248 0.0503.\n\nP(5) \u2248 0.1606.\n\n0.0503 / 0.1606 \u2248 0.3135, so approximately 0.3135.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use exact values instead of approximations.\n\nLet me compute P(2) more accurately.\n\nP(2) = (3^2 * e^(-3)) / 2! = (9 * e^(-3)) / 2.\n\ne^(-3) \u2248 0.049787068.\n\nSo, 9 * 0.049787068 \u2248 0.448033616.\n\nDivide by 2: 0.448033616 / 2 \u2248 0.224016808.\n\nSimilarly, P(3) = (3^3 * e^(-3)) / 6 = (27 * 0.049787068) / 6.\n\n27 * 0.049787068 \u2248 1.3402958.\n\nDivide by 6: 1.3402958 / 6 \u2248 0.223382983.\n\nSo, numerator is 0.224016808 * 0.223382983 \u2248 Let's compute that.\n\n0.224016808 * 0.223382983 \u2248 Multiply 0.224 * 0.223 \u2248 0.050112.\n\nBut more precisely:\n\n0.224016808 * 0.223382983 \u2248\n\nFirst, multiply 0.224016808 * 0.223382983.\n\nLet me compute:\n\n0.224016808 * 0.223382983 \u2248\n\nApproximate step by step:\n\n0.224 * 0.223 = 0.050112.\n\nBut let's compute more accurately.\n\n0.224016808 * 0.223382983.\n\nMultiply 0.224016808 * 0.223382983.\n\nI can use a calculator step:\n\n0.224016808 * 0.223382983 \u2248 0.050296.\n\nSo, numerator \u2248 0.050296.\n\nDenominator: P(5) = (6^5 * e^(-6)) / 5!.\n\n6^5 = 7776.\n\ne^(-6) \u2248 0.002478752.\n\n5! = 120.\n\nSo, P(5) = (7776 * 0.002478752) / 120.\n\nCompute 7776 * 0.002478752.\n\nFirst, 7776 * 0.002 = 15.552.\n\n7776 * 0.000478752 \u2248 Let's compute 7776 * 0.0004 = 3.1104, 7776 * 0.000078752 \u2248 0.610.\n\nSo, total \u2248 3.1104 + 0.610 = 3.7204.\n\nSo, total 7776 * 0.002478752 \u2248 15.552 + 3.7204 \u2248 19.2724.\n\nDivide by 120: 19.2724 / 120 \u2248 0.160602.\n\nSo, P(5) \u2248 0.160602.\n\nTherefore, conditional probability \u2248 0.050296 / 0.160602 \u2248 0.3134.\n\nSo, approximately 0.3134, or 31.34%.\n\nWait, but let me check if I can use a more precise method. Alternatively, since the Poisson process is memoryless, the number of arrivals in the first 15 minutes given that there are k arrivals in the first 30 minutes can be calculated using the binomial distribution, since the two intervals are independent.\n\nSo, the number of arrivals in the first 15 minutes is Poisson(3), and in the second 15 minutes is Poisson(3). So, the joint distribution is Poisson(3) for the first interval and Poisson(3) for the second.\n\nGiven that the total is 5, the probability that k arrived in the first interval is equal to the probability that in the first interval, k arrived, and in the second, 5 - k arrived.\n\nSo, the conditional probability P(k | total 5) = P(k in first 15 and 5 -k in second 15) / P(total 5).\n\nBut since the two intervals are independent, P(k in first 15 and 5 -k in second 15) = P(k) * P(5 -k).\n\nTherefore, the conditional probability is sum_{k=0}^5 [P(k) * P(5 -k)] / P(5).\n\nBut since the two intervals are independent Poisson variables, the total is Poisson(6), so P(5) is as computed.\n\nBut to find P(k in first 15 | total 5), it's equal to [P(k) * P(5 -k)] / P(5).\n\nWhich is the same as I did earlier.\n\nSo, for k=2, it's [P(2) * P(3)] / P(5) \u2248 (0.2240168 * 0.22338298) / 0.160602 \u2248 0.050296 / 0.160602 \u2248 0.3134.\n\nSo, approximately 0.3134.\n\nAlternatively, if I use more precise values:\n\nCompute P(2) exactly: (3^2 e^{-3}) / 2! = (9 e^{-3}) / 2.\n\nCompute e^{-3} \u2248 0.049787068.\n\nSo, 9 * 0.049787068 \u2248 0.448033616.\n\nDivide by 2: 0.224016808.\n\nSimilarly, P(3) = (27 e^{-3}) / 6 = (27 * 0.049787068) / 6 \u2248 1.3402958 / 6 \u2248 0.223382983.\n\nMultiply them: 0.224016808 * 0.223382983 \u2248 0.050296.\n\nP(5) = (7776 e^{-6}) / 120.\n\nCompute e^{-6} \u2248 0.002478752.\n\n7776 * 0.002478752 \u2248 Let's compute precisely.\n\n7776 * 0.002 = 15.552.\n\n7776 * 0.000478752 \u2248 7776 * 0.0004 = 3.1104, and 7776 * 0.000078752 \u2248 0.610.\n\nSo, 3.1104 + 0.610 = 3.7204.\n\nTotal 15.552 + 3.7204 = 19.2724.\n\nDivide by 120: 19.2724 / 120 = 0.160602.\n\nSo, P(5) = 0.160602.\n\nTherefore, conditional probability = 0.050296 / 0.160602 \u2248 0.3134.\n\nSo, approximately 0.3134, or 31.34%.\n\nTherefore, the probability is approximately 0.3134.\n\nWait, but let me check if I can write the exact expression instead of the approximate decimal.\n\nThe exact probability is [ (3^2 e^{-3}) / 2! * (3^3 e^{-3}) / 3! ] / [ (6^5 e^{-6}) / 5! ].\n\nSimplify:\n\nNumerator: (9 e^{-3}/2) * (27 e^{-3}/6) = (9*27 e^{-6}) / (2*6) = (243 e^{-6}) / 12.\n\nDenominator: (7776 e^{-6}) / 120.\n\nSo, the ratio is [243/12] / [7776/120] * e^{-6} / e^{-6} = (243/12) * (120/7776) = (243 * 120) / (12 * 7776).\n\nSimplify:\n\n243 / 12 = 20.25.\n\n120 / 7776 = 120 / 7776 = 5 / 324 \u2248 0.015432.\n\nWait, but let's compute it as fractions:\n\n243 / 12 = 81 / 4.\n\n120 / 7776 = 120 / 7776 = 5 / 324.\n\nSo, (81/4) * (5/324) = (81*5) / (4*324) = 405 / 1296.\n\nSimplify 405/1296: divide numerator and denominator by 9: 45/144, again by 9: 5/16.\n\nSo, 5/16.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 5/16 is 0.3125, which is close to our approximate 0.3134.\n\nSo, the exact probability is 5/16, which is 0.3125.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 5/16, which is 0.3125.\n\nSo, that's a cleaner way to express it.\n\nTherefore, the exact probability is 5/16.\n\nSo, that's better than the approximate decimal.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\nFor part (a), the probability is (3^3 e^{-3}) / 3! \u2248 0.223.\n\nFor part (b), the conditional probability is 5/16"

End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: A small local bakery receives customers according to a Poisson process with a rate of 12 customers per hour. The bakery opens at 8:00 AM. \n\n(a) What is the probability that the bakery receives exactly 3 customers in the first 15 minutes of operation?\n\n(b) Given that 5 customers arrived during the first half hour, what is the probability that exactly 2 of them arrived during the first 15 minutes? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem about a Poisson process at a bakery. Let me try to understand what it's asking and how to approach it.\n\nFirst, the bakery gets customers according to a Poisson process with a rate of 12 customers per hour. They open at 8:00 AM. \n\nPart (a) asks for the probability that the bakery receives exactly 3 customers in the first 15 minutes of operation. Hmm, okay. So, the first 15 minutes would be from 8:00 AM to 8:15 AM.\n\nI remember that a Poisson process has events (arrivals) that occur independently at a constant average rate. The probability of a certain number of events in a given time interval can be found using the Poisson probability formula. The formula is:\n\nP(k) = (\u03bb^k * e^(-\u03bb)) / k!\n\nWhere \u03bb is the average rate (expected number of occurrences) multiplied by the time interval. So, I need to calculate \u03bb for 15 minutes.\n\nWait, the rate is given per hour, so I need to convert that to per minute. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 12 customers per hour is 12/60 = 0.2 customers per minute. So, \u03bb for 15 minutes is 0.2 * 15 = 3. Okay, so \u03bb is 3.\n\nSo, for part (a), we want the probability of exactly 3 customers in 15 minutes. Plugging into the formula:\n\nP(3) = (3^3 * e^(-3)) / 3!\n\nCalculating that:\n\n3^3 is 27, e^(-3) is approximately 0.0498, and 3! is 6. So,\n\n27 * 0.0498 = 1.3466\n\nThen, 1.3466 / 6 \u2248 0.2245\n\nSo, approximately 22.45% chance. I think that's it for part (a).\n\nNow, part (b) is a bit trickier. It says, given that 5 customers arrived during the first half hour, what is the probability that exactly 2 of them arrived during the first 15 minutes?\n\nHmm, so this is a conditional probability. We're given that in the first 30 minutes (from 8:00 AM to 8:30 AM), there were exactly 5 customers. Now, we need to find the probability that exactly 2 of these 5 arrived in the first 15 minutes.\n\nThis sounds like a problem where we can use the concept of conditional probability. The formula for conditional probability is:\n\nP(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B)\n\nBut in this case, since we're given that exactly 5 customers arrived in the first 30 minutes, the event B is that there are exactly 5 customers in 30 minutes. We're looking for the probability that exactly 2 of them are in the first 15 minutes, given that exactly 5 arrived in the first 30 minutes.\n\nWait, actually, since the Poisson process is memoryless, the arrivals in the first 15 minutes and the next 15 minutes are independent. So, given that there are 5 customers in the first 30 minutes, the number of customers in the first 15 minutes and the second 15 minutes are both Poisson variables with \u03bb = 3 each.\n\nBut we need to find the probability that exactly 2 arrived in the first 15 minutes, given that the total in 30 minutes is 5. So, it's like splitting 5 customers into two independent Poisson variables, each with \u03bb=3, and finding the probability that one of them is 2.\n\nWait, but I think we can model this as a binomial distribution because we're splitting a fixed number of successes (customers) into two independent trials (15-minute intervals). However, since the number of customers is fixed at 5, the conditional probability can be approached using combinatorics.\n\nSo, the number of ways to choose exactly 2 customers to arrive in the first 15 minutes out of the 5 is C(5,2). Then, the probability that exactly 2 arrive in the first 15 minutes is (P(2 in 15 min))^2, since the two 15-minute intervals are independent.\n\nWait, no, that's not exactly right. Because the total number is 5, the number in the first 15 minutes and the second 15 minutes must sum to 5. So, if we have exactly 2 in the first 15 minutes, then the second 15 minutes must have exactly 3.\n\nSince the two intervals are independent, the joint probability is the product of the individual probabilities.\n\nSo, the conditional probability P(exactly 2 in first 15 | total 5 in 30) is equal to [P(2 in first 15) * P(3 in second 15)] / P(total 5 in 30).\n\nBut P(2 in first 15) is the probability of 2 customers in 15 minutes, which is (3^2 * e^(-3)) / 2! = (9 * 0.0498) / 2 \u2248 0.2245.\n\nSimilarly, P(3 in second 15) is the same, (3^3 * e^(-3)) / 3! \u2248 0.2245.\n\nSo, the joint probability is 0.2245 * 0.2245 \u2248 0.0505.\n\nNow, P(total 5 in 30) is the probability of exactly 5 customers in 30 minutes. The rate per minute is still 0.2, so \u03bb = 0.2 * 30 = 6.\n\nSo, P(5) = (6^5 * e^(-6)) / 5! \n\nCalculating that:\n\n6^5 = 7776, e^(-6) \u2248 0.002479, 5! = 120.\n\nSo, 7776 * 0.002479 \u2248 19.31\n\nThen, 19.31 / 120 \u2248 0.1610\n\nSo, the conditional probability is 0.0505 / 0.1610 \u2248 0.314, or 31.4%.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there another way to approach this? Maybe using the multinomial distribution.\n\nSince the arrivals are a Poisson process, the number of customers in non-overlapping intervals are independent Poisson variables. So, given that the total is 5, the probability that 2 are in the first 15 minutes is the same as the probability that in two independent trials, each with \u03bb=3, the sum is 5 and one is 2.\n\nBut since the two intervals are independent, the probability is the same as P(2 in first 15, 3 in second 15) divided by P(total 5).\n\nWhich is exactly what I did before.\n\nAlternatively, since the process is memoryless, the number of arrivals in the first 15 minutes given the total in 30 minutes can be modeled as a binomial distribution with n=2 trials and probability p=\u03bb/3=1 (since \u03bb=3 per 15 minutes). Wait, no, actually, for each 15-minute interval, the Poisson parameter is 3, so the probability of k arrivals in a 15-minute interval is Poisson(k;3).\n\nBut since the two intervals are independent, the number of arrivals in the first 15 minutes can be 0,1,2,3,4,5, and similarly for the second. Given that the total is 5, the number in the first 15 minutes can be from 0 to 5, and the second 15 minutes will be 5 minus that.\n\nBut we're interested in the probability that the first 15 minutes has exactly 2, given that the total is 5.\n\nSo, the conditional probability is the probability that the first has 2 and the second has 3, divided by the probability that the total is 5.\n\nSince the two intervals are independent, P(first=2 and second=3) = P(first=2) * P(second=3) = (3^2 e^{-3}/2!) * (3^3 e^{-3}/3!) = (9 * 0.0498 / 2) * (27 * 0.0498 / 6)\n\nCalculating that:\n\nFirst part: 9 * 0.0498 \u2248 0.4482 / 2 \u2248 0.2241\n\nSecond part: 27 * 0.0498 \u2248 1.3466 / 6 \u2248 0.2245\n\nSo, 0.2241 * 0.2245 \u2248 0.0505\n\nAs before, P(total=5) is (6^5 e^{-6}) / 5! \u2248 0.1610\n\nSo, 0.0505 / 0.1610 \u2248 0.314\n\nSo, approximately 31.4% chance.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculations because sometimes when dealing with Poisson, it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nFor part (a):\n\n\u03bb = 0.2 * 15 = 3\n\nP(3) = (3^3 e^{-3}) / 3! = (27 * 0.0498) / 6 \u2248 1.3466 / 6 \u2248 0.2245, which is about 22.45%. That seems correct.\n\nFor part (b):\n\nGiven 5 in 30 minutes, which is \u03bb=6 for 30 minutes.\n\nWe want the probability that exactly 2 are in the first 15 minutes. Since the first and second 15 minutes are independent, the probability is [P(2 in first 15) * P(3 in second 15)] / P(5 in 30)\n\nWe calculated P(2 in first 15) \u2248 0.2245 and P(3 in second 15) \u2248 0.2245, so their product is \u22480.0505.\n\nP(5 in 30) is (6^5 e^{-6}) / 120 \u2248 (7776 * 0.002479) / 120 \u2248 19.31 / 120 \u2248 0.1610\n\nSo, 0.0505 / 0.1610 \u2248 0.314, which is about 31.4%.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to think of the conditional probability as the number of ways to distribute 5 customers into two intervals, each with Poisson(3), divided by the total number of ways.\n\nBut I think the way I did it is correct.\n\nSo, final answers:\n\n(a) Approximately 0.2245, or 22.45%\n\n(b) Approximately 0.314, or 31.4%\n\nI think that's it.\n</think>\n\n(a) To find the probability that the bakery receives exactly 3 customers in the first 15 minutes, we use the Poisson probability formula. The rate \u03bb for 15 minutes is 3, so:\n\nP(3) = (3\u00b3 * e\u207b\u00b3) / 3! \u2248 0.2245\n\n(b) Given 5 customers in the first 30 minutes, we split this into two 15-minute intervals. The probability of exactly 2 in the first 15 minutes and 3 in the second is:\n\nP(2 in first 15 and 3 in second 15) = P(2) * P(3) \u2248 0.2245 * 0.2245 \u2248 0.0505\n\nThe total probability of 5 customers in 30 minutes is:\n\nP(5) \u2248 0.1610\n\nThus, the conditional probability is 0.0505 / 0.1610 \u2248 0.314\n\nDONE."

It's part (a) and part (b). Let me start with part (a).\n\n**Problem (a):** What is the probability that the bakery receives exactly 3 customers in the first 15 minutes of operation?\n\nOkay, so the bakery opens at 8:00 AM, and customers arrive according to a Poisson process with a rate of 12 customers per hour. I need to find the probability of exactly 3 customers in the first 15 minutes.\n\nFirst, let's recall what a Poisson process is. It's a continuous-time process where events (in this case, customer arrivals) occur at a constant average rate, independently of the time since the last event. The probability of events happening in non-overlapping intervals can be calculated using the Poisson probability formula.\n\nThe Poisson probability formula is:\n\nP(k) = (\u03bb^k * e^{-\u03bb}) / k!\n\nWhere:\n- P(k) is the probability of k events occurring.\n- \u03bb is the average rate (expected number of events in a given time period).\n- k is the number of occurrences.\n\nSo, for part (a), I need to find the probability that exactly 3 customers arrive in 15 minutes.\n\nFirst, let's convert 15 minutes into hours because the rate is given per hour. 15 minutes is 0.25 hours.\n\nSo, \u03bb = 12 customers per hour. But since we're looking at a 15-minute period, which is 0.25 hours, the expected number of customers in that time is \u03bb * t = 12 * 0.25 = 3. So, \u03bb for this specific 15-minute interval is 3.\n\nTherefore, for part (a), the probability P(3) is:\n\nP(3) = (3^3 * e^{-3}) / 3!\n\nLet me compute this step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate 3^3:\n\n3^3 = 27\n\nNext, e^{-3} is approximately e^(-3) \u2248 0.049787\n\nThen, 3! is 6.\n\nSo, plugging these in:\n\nP(3) = (27 * 0.049787) / 6\n\nLet's compute 27 * 0.049787 first.\n\n27 * 0.049787 \u2248 27 * 0.0498 \u2248 1.3466\n\nNow, divide by 6:\n\n1.3466 / 6 \u2248 0.2243\n\nSo, approximately 0.2243 or 22.43%.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me double-check the computation.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute e^{-3} more accurately.\n\ne^{-3} \u2248 0.049787\n\nSo, 3^3 = 27.\n\n27 * 0.049787 = ?\n\nLet me compute 27 * 0.049787.\n\nFirst, 27 * 0.04 = 1.08\n\nThen, 27 * 0.009787 \u2248 27 * 0.01 = 0.27, but since it's 0.009787, it's a bit less.\n\nSo, 27 * 0.009787 \u2248 0.264\n\nSo, total is approximately 1.08 + 0.264 = 1.344\n\nThen, 1.344 / 6 = 0.224\n\nSo, yes, approximately 0.224.\n\nTherefore, the probability is approximately 0.224, or 22.4%.\n\nSo, that's part (a). Now, moving on to part (b).\n\n**Problem (b):** Given that 5 customers arrived during the first half hour, what is the probability that exactly 2 of them arrived during the first 15 minutes?\n\nHmm, so this is a conditional probability problem. We are given that 5 customers arrived in the first half hour, and we need to find the probability that exactly 2 arrived in the first 15 minutes.\n\nFirst, let's note the time periods. The first half hour is 0.5 hours, and the first 15 minutes is 0.25 hours.\n\nSince the process is Poisson, the number of arrivals in disjoint intervals are independent. So, if we know that 5 arrived in the first 0.5 hours, the number arriving in the first 0.25 hours and the next 0.25 hours are independent Poisson variables.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- Let X be the number of customers arriving in the first 15 minutes (0.25 hours).\n\n- Let Y be the number of customers arriving in the next 15 minutes (from 8:15 to 8:30 AM).\n\nWe are given that X + Y = 5, and we need to find P(X = 2 | X + Y = 5).\n\nAlternatively, since X and Y are independent Poisson variables with parameters \u03bb1 and \u03bb2, where \u03bb1 is the rate for the first 15 minutes and \u03bb2 for the next 15 minutes.\n\nGiven that the overall rate is 12 per hour, in the first 15 minutes, \u03bb1 = 12 * 0.25 = 3, and in the next 15 minutes, \u03bb2 = 12 * 0.25 = 3 as well. Wait, no, that can't be, because the total in 30 minutes would be 6, but we have 5. Hmm, but the Poisson process has independent increments, so the number in each interval is independent.\n\nWait, but actually, the rate is constant over time, so the number of arrivals in any interval of length t is Poisson with parameter \u03bbt.\n\nTherefore, in the first 0.25 hours, \u03bb1 = 12 * 0.25 = 3.\n\nIn the next 0.25 hours, \u03bb2 = 12 * 0.25 = 3.\n\nSo, X ~ Poisson(3), Y ~ Poisson(3), and X and Y are independent.\n\nWe are given that X + Y = 5, and we need to find P(X=2 | X+Y=5).\n\nAlternatively, this is equivalent to P(X=2 and Y=3) / P(X+Y=5).\n\nBut since X and Y are independent, P(X=2 and Y=3) = P(X=2) * P(Y=3).\n\nSimilarly, P(X+Y=5) is the probability that X + Y =5, which is the sum over k=0 to5 P(X=k) * P(Y=5\u2212k).\n\nBut since X and Y are independent Poisson(3), their joint distribution is Poisson(6), but we are conditioning on X+Y=5.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to compute P(X=2 | X+Y=5) = P(X=2 and Y=3) / P(X+Y=5).\n\nSo, let's compute P(X=2) and P(Y=3).\n\nP(X=2) = (3^2 e^{-3}) / 2! = (9 e^{-3}) / 2 \u2248 (9 * 0.049787) / 2 \u2248 (0.448) / 2 \u2248 0.224\n\nSimilarly, P(Y=3) = same as P(X=3) = (3^3 e^{-3}) / 3! \u2248 (27 * 0.049787) / 6 \u2248 1.3466 /6 \u2248 0.2243\n\nSo, P(X=2 and Y=3) = P(X=2) * P(Y=3) \u2248 0.224 * 0.2243 \u2248 0.0504\n\nNow, P(X + Y =5) is the sum over k=0 to5 of P(X=k) * P(Y=5\u2212k).\n\nBut since X and Y are independent Poisson(3), P(X=k) = (3^k e^{-3}) / k!\n\nSo, let's compute P(X + Y=5):\n\nP(X=0)P(Y=5) + P(X=1)P(Y=4) + P(X=2)P(Y=3) + P(X=3)P(Y=2) + P(X=4)P(Y=1) + P(X=5)P(Y=0)\n\nBut since X and Y are symmetric, P(X=k) = P(Y=k), so P(X=0)P(Y=5)=P(X=5)P(Y=0), etc.\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\n1. P(X=0)P(Y=5):\n\nP(X=0) = e^{-3} \u2248 0.049787\n\nP(Y=5) = (3^5 e^{-3}) / 5! = (243 * 0.049787) / 120 \u2248 (12.06) / 120 \u2248 0.1005\n\nSo, P(X=0)P(Y=5) \u2248 0.049787 * 0.1005 \u2248 0.00502\n\n2. P(X=1)P(Y=4):\n\nP(X=1) = (3 e^{-3}) / 1! \u2248 3 * 0.049787 \u2248 0.14936\n\nP(Y=4) = (3^4 e^{-3}) / 4! = (81 * 0.049787) / 24 \u2248 (4.02) / 24 \u2248 0.1675\n\nSo, P(X=1)P(Y=4) \u2248 0.14936 * 0.1675 \u2248 0.02500\n\n3. P(X=2)P(Y=3):\n\nWe already have P(X=2)=0.224, P(Y=3)=0.2243\n\nSo, P(X=2)P(Y=3) \u2248 0.224 * 0.2243 \u2248 0.0504\n\n4. P(X=3)P(Y=2):\n\nP(X=3)=0.2243, P(Y=2)= same as P(X=2)=0.224\n\nSo, P(X=3)P(Y=2)=0.2243 * 0.224 \u2248 0.0504\n\n5. P(X=4)P(Y=1):\n\nP(X=4)= (3^4 e^{-3}) / 4! = same as P(Y=4)=0.1675\n\nP(Y=1)=3 e^{-3}=0.14936\n\nSo, P(X=4)P(Y=1)=0.1675 * 0.14936 \u2248 0.02500\n\n6. P(X=5)P(Y=0):\n\nP(X=5)= (3^5 e^{-3}) /5! \u2248 0.1005\n\nP(Y=0)=e^{-3} \u22480.049787\n\nSo, P(X=5)P(Y=0)=0.1005 * 0.049787 \u2248 0.00502\n\nNow, adding all these up:\n\n0.00502 + 0.02500 + 0.0504 + 0.0504 + 0.02500 + 0.00502\n\nLet me compute step by step:\n\nStart with 0.00502\n\n+0.02500 = 0.03002\n\n+0.0504 = 0.08042\n\n+0.0504 = 0.13082\n\n+0.02500 = 0.15582\n\n+0.00502 = 0.16084\n\nSo, approximately 0.16084.\n\nTherefore, P(X+Y=5) \u2248 0.1608\n\nSo, P(X=2 | X+Y=5) = P(X=2 and Y=3) / P(X+Y=5) \u2248 0.0504 / 0.1608 \u2248 0.3136\n\nSo, approximately 31.36%.\n\nBut let me check if that makes sense. Since given that 5 customers arrived in 30 minutes, the probability that exactly 2 arrived in the first 15 minutes.\n\nGiven that the average is 3 per 15 minutes, 2 is below average, so the probability should be less than 0.5, which it is.\n\nAlternatively, we can think about it as a hypergeometric-like problem, but since it's Poisson, it's slightly different.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the multinomial distribution approach, but I think the way I did it is correct.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\n(a) Probability of exactly 3 customers in the first 15 minutes is approximately 0.224.\n\n(b) Given 5 customers in the first half hour, the probability that exactly 2 arrived in the first 15 minutes is approximately 0.3136.\n</think>\n\n(a) The probability is approximately 0.224.\n\n(b) The conditional probability is approximately 0.3136.\n\nSo, the final answers are:\n\n(a) \\boxed{0.224}\n\n(b) \\boxed{0.3136}\n\nDONE."

End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: A small local bakery receives customers according to a Poisson process with a rate of 12 customers per hour. The bakery opens at 8:00 AM. \n\n(a) What is the probability that the bakery receives exactly 3 customers in the first 15 minutes of operation?\n\n(b) Given that 5 customers arrived during the first half hour, what is the probability that exactly 2 of them arrived during the first 15 minutes? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this problem about a bakery receiving customers according to a Poisson process. Let's break it down step by step. \n\nFirst, the problem has two parts, (a) and (b). I'll start with part (a).\n\n(a) The question is asking for the probability that the bakery receives exactly 3 customers in the first 15 minutes of operation. The bakery opens at 8:00 AM, and the arrival rate is 12 customers per hour. \n\nOkay, so Poisson process basics: In a Poisson process, the number of events (customers, in this case) in disjoint intervals follow a Poisson distribution. The Poisson distribution formula is:\n\nP(k) = (\u03bb^k * e^(-\u03bb)) / k!\n\nWhere:\n- P(k) is the probability of k events.\n- \u03bb is the average rate (mean) multiplied by the time interval.\n- k is the number of occurrences.\n\nSo, for part (a), the time interval is 15 minutes, which is 0.25 hours. The rate \u03bb is 12 customers per hour, so for 15 minutes, the expected number of customers would be \u03bb * t = 12 * 0.25 = 3.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So the expected number of customers in the first 15 minutes is 3. The question is asking for the probability of exactly 3 customers. So, using the Poisson formula, it would be:\n\nP(3) = (3^3 * e^(-3)) / 3!\n\nLet me compute that.\n\nFirst, compute 3^3: 3*3*3 = 27.\n\nThen, e^(-3) is approximately e^(-3) \u2248 0.049787.\n\nNext, 3! is 3*2*1 = 6.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nP(3) = (27 * 0.049787) / 6.\n\nCompute numerator: 27 * 0.049787 \u2248 1.340.\n\nThen divide by 6: 1.340 / 6 \u2248 0.2233.\n\nSo approximately 0.2233, or 22.33%.\n\nWait, but let me double-check if I did the time conversion correctly. The rate is 12 per hour, so per minute, the rate would be 12 / 60 = 0.2 customers per minute. Then, 15 minutes would give \u03bb = 0.2 * 15 = 3. So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes Poisson processes use hours as the time unit, so 15 minutes is 0.25 hours, so \u03bb = 12 * 0.25 = 3. Same result.\n\nSo, yes, the calculation seems right.\n\nMoving on to part (b):\n\n(b) Given that 5 customers arrived during the first half hour, what is the probability that exactly 2 of them arrived during the first 15 minutes?\n\nHmm, okay, this is a conditional probability problem. We have to find the probability that exactly 2 customers arrived in the first 15 minutes, given that 5 arrived in the first 30 minutes.\n\nSo, in probability terms, this is P(exactly 2 in first 15 | exactly 5 in first 30).\n\nTo solve this, I think we can use the concept of Poisson process properties. One important property is that the number of arrivals in disjoint intervals are independent Poisson random variables. So, the first 15 minutes and the next 15 minutes (i.e., the second half hour) are independent.\n\nWait, let me think. If the first half hour has exactly 5 customers, and the process is Poisson, then the number of customers in the first 15 minutes and the second 15 minutes should be independent Poisson variables with \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 respectively.\n\nBut in this case, the total number in the first half hour is 5, so we can model the number in the first 15 minutes as a Poisson variable X with \u03bb1, and the number in the second 15 minutes as another Poisson variable Y with \u03bb2, where \u03bb1 + \u03bb2 = 5.\n\nBut actually, since the Poisson process is stationary, the rate per interval should be consistent. Wait, but the total rate is 12 per hour, so per 30 minutes, the expected number is 12 * 0.5 = 6. So given that, but we have exactly 5 customers in 30 minutes. So, the conditional probability that in the first 15 minutes, exactly 2 arrived, given that in the first 30 minutes, 5 arrived.\n\nSo, let's model this.\n\nLet X ~ Poisson(\u03bb1) be the number of customers in the first 15 minutes.\n\nLet Y ~ Poisson(\u03bb2) be the number of customers in the second 15 minutes.\n\nWe know that X + Y = 5.\n\nWe are to find P(X = 2 | X + Y = 5).\n\nSince X and Y are independent Poisson variables, given that X + Y = 5, the conditional probability P(X = 2 | X + Y = 5) is equal to P(X = 2 and Y = 3) / P(X + Y = 5).\n\nBut since X and Y are independent, P(X = 2 and Y = 3) = P(X=2) * P(Y=3).\n\nSo, let's compute that.\n\nFirst, compute \u03bb1 and \u03bb2.\n\nSince the rate is 12 per hour, the rate per 15 minutes is 12 * (15/60) = 12 * 0.25 = 3.\n\nWait, but if the first half hour has 5 customers, then the average rate in the first half hour is 5 / 0.5 = 10 per hour? Wait, that doesn't make sense because the rate is given as 12 per hour.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, no. The Poisson process has a constant rate. So, the rate \u03bb is 12 per hour, regardless of the time interval. So, the number of customers in any interval of length t is Poisson with parameter \u03bb * t.\n\nSo, for the first half hour (0.5 hours), the expected number is 12 * 0.5 = 6. But we have exactly 5 customers in that time.\n\nSo, the conditional probability is given that in the first 0.5 hours, there were 5 customers, what's the probability that in the first 0.25 hours, there were 2 customers.\n\nSo, let me denote:\n\nLet X ~ Poisson(\u03bb1) be the number in first 15 minutes.\n\nLet Y ~ Poisson(\u03bb2) be the number in the second 15 minutes.\n\nWe have X + Y = 5.\n\nWe need to find P(X=2 | X + Y =5).\n\nSince X and Y are independent Poisson variables, the joint distribution is Poisson with parameters (\u03bb1, \u03bb2), where \u03bb1 + \u03bb2 = 5.\n\nBut wait, no. The joint distribution is Poisson with parameters (\u03bb1, \u03bb2), but since the process is Poisson, the counts in disjoint intervals are independent.\n\nSo, the joint probability P(X=k, Y=m) = P(X=k) * P(Y=m).\n\nBut given that X + Y =5, we have to condition on that.\n\nSo, P(X=2 | X + Y=5) = P(X=2, Y=3) / P(X + Y=5).\n\nCompute numerator: P(X=2) * P(Y=3).\n\nCompute denominator: P(X + Y=5).\n\nNow, let's compute each part.\n\nFirst, \u03bb1 is the rate in the first 15 minutes, which is 12 * 0.25 = 3.\n\nSimilarly, \u03bb2 is the rate in the second 15 minutes, which is also 12 * 0.25 = 3.\n\nSo, X ~ Poisson(3), Y ~ Poisson(3).\n\nCompute P(X=2): (3^2 * e^{-3}) / 2! = (9 * 0.049787) / 2 \u2248 4.410 / 2 \u2248 2.205.\n\nCompute P(Y=3): same as P(X=3) because Y is Poisson(3). So, (3^3 * e^{-3}) / 3! = (27 * 0.049787) / 6 \u2248 1.340 / 6 \u2248 0.2233.\n\nSo, numerator: 2.205 * 0.2233 \u2248 0.493.\n\nDenominator: P(X + Y=5). Since X and Y are independent Poisson(3), the sum X + Y is Poisson with parameter \u03bb1 + \u03bb2 = 6.\n\nSo, P(X + Y=5) = (6^5 * e^{-6}) / 5! = (7776 * e^{-6}) / 120.\n\nCompute e^{-6} \u2248 0.002478752.\n\nSo, numerator: 7776 * 0.002478752 \u2248 19.24.\n\nDivide by 120: 19.24 / 120 \u2248 0.1603.\n\nSo, P(X=2 | X+Y=5) \u2248 0.493 / 0.1603 \u2248 3.077.\n\nWait, that can't be right because probabilities can't exceed 1. Hmm, I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, let's check the calculations again.\n\nFirst, compute P(X=2):\n\n(3^2 * e^{-3}) / 2! = 9 * 0.049787 / 2 \u2248 0.224.\n\nSimilarly, P(Y=3) is the same as P(X=3) = (3^3 * e^{-3}) / 6 \u2248 0.049787 * 27 / 6 \u2248 0.049787 * 4.5 \u2248 0.224.\n\nWait, no, 27/6 is 4.5, so 0.049787 * 4.5 \u2248 0.224.\n\nWait, so P(X=2) is approximately 0.224 and P(Y=3) is approximately 0.224.\n\nSo, numerator: 0.224 * 0.224 \u2248 0.0505.\n\nDenominator: P(X + Y=5). Since X and Y are independent Poisson(3), the sum is Poisson(6). So, P(X + Y=5) = e^{-6} * 6^5 / 5! \u2248 e^{-6} * 7776 / 120.\n\nCompute 7776 / 120 = 64.8.\n\nSo, 64.8 * e^{-6} \u2248 64.8 * 0.002478752 \u2248 0.1603.\n\nSo, numerator / denominator \u2248 0.0505 / 0.1603 \u2248 0.314.\n\nSo, approximately 0.314, or 31.4%.\n\nWait, that seems more reasonable.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the numerator was 0.493 and denominator 0.1603, which gave over 1. But that was a miscalculation.\n\nWait, I think I messed up the calculation of P(X=2) and P(Y=3). Let me recalculate.\n\nCompute P(X=2):\n\n\u03bb=3, k=2.\n\nP(2) = (3^2 * e^{-3}) / 2! = (9 * 0.049787) / 2 \u2248 (0.448) / 2 \u2248 0.224.\n\nSimilarly, P(Y=3) = (3^3 * e^{-3}) / 6 = (27 * 0.049787) / 6 \u2248 (1.340) / 6 \u2248 0.2233.\n\nSo, P(X=2) \u2248 0.224, P(Y=3) \u2248 0.2233.\n\nSo, their product is approximately 0.224 * 0.2233 \u2248 0.0502.\n\nDenominator: P(X + Y=5) = e^{-6} * 6^5 / 5! \u2248 0.002478752 * 7776 / 120.\n\nCompute 7776 / 120 = 64.8.\n\n64.8 * 0.002478752 \u2248 0.1603.\n\nSo, 0.0502 / 0.1603 \u2248 0.313.\n\nSo, approximately 0.313, or 31.3%.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's exactly 5/16, which is 0.3125.\n\nWait, 5/16 is 0.3125. So, perhaps the exact value is 5/16.\n\nLet me check.\n\nCompute the exact value:\n\nP(X=2 | X + Y=5) = P(X=2, Y=3) / P(X + Y=5).\n\nBut since X and Y are independent Poisson(3), P(X=2, Y=3) = P(X=2)P(Y=3).\n\nCompute P(X=2) = (3^2 e^{-3}) / 2! = 9 e^{-3} / 2.\n\nSimilarly, P(Y=3) = (3^3 e^{-3}) / 3! = 27 e^{-3} / 6 = 9 e^{-3} / 2.\n\nSo, P(X=2)P(Y=3) = (9 e^{-3}/2) * (9 e^{-3}/2) = (81 e^{-6}) / 4.\n\nP(X + Y=5) = e^{-6} 6^5 / 5! = e^{-6} 7776 / 120 = e^{-6} 64.8.\n\nSo, the ratio is (81 e^{-6}/4) / (64.8 e^{-6}) = (81 / 4) / 64.8 = (81 / 4) * (1 / 64.8) = (81) / (4 * 64.8) = 81 / 259.2.\n\nSimplify 81 / 259.2:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 81: 1 / (259.2 / 81) = 1 / 3.2 = 5/16.\n\nBecause 3.2 is 16/5, so 1/(16/5) = 5/16.\n\nYes, so 5/16 is exactly 0.3125.\n\nSo, the exact probability is 5/16.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 5/16.\n\nWait, let me confirm that.\n\nYes, because 81 divided by 259.2 is equal to 81 \u00f7 259.2.\n\nCompute 259.2 \u00f7 81: 81 * 3 = 243, 243 + 16.2 = 259.2, so 3 + 16.2/81 = 3 + 0.2 = 3.2.\n\nSo, 81 / 259.2 = 1 / 3.2 = 5/16.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nSo, the conditional probability is 5/16.\n\nTherefore, part (a) is approximately 0.2233, or 22.33%, and part (b) is exactly 5/16, which is 0.3125 or 31.25%.\n\nI think that's it.\n</think>\n\n(a) The probability that the bakery receives exactly 3 customers in the first 15 minutes is calculated using the Poisson probability formula.

End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: A small local bakery receives customers according to a Poisson process with a rate of 12 customers per hour. The bakery opens at 8:00 AM. \n\n(a) What is the probability that the bakery receives exactly 3 customers in the first 15 minutes of operation?\n\n(b) Given that 5 customers arrived during the first half hour, what is the probability that exactly 2 of them arrived during the first 15 minutes? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this problem about a Poisson process at a bakery. Let me try to figure it out step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem says the bakery gets customers according to a Poisson process with a rate of 12 customers per hour. They open at 8:00 AM. \n\nPart (a) asks: What is the probability that the bakery receives exactly 3 customers in the first 15 minutes of operation?\n\nOkay, so I remember that a Poisson process has events that occur independently at a constant average rate. The probability of events happening in a given time interval follows the Poisson distribution.\n\nThe Poisson probability formula is:\n\nP(k) = (\u03bb^k * e^(-\u03bb)) / k!\n\nWhere:\n- P(k) is the probability of k events.\n- \u03bb is the average rate (expected number of occurrences).\n- k is the number of occurrences.\n\nSo, for part (a), the time interval is 15 minutes. Since the rate is given per hour, I need to convert that to per minute.\n\n12 customers per hour is 12 customers per 60 minutes. So, the rate per minute is 12/60 = 0.2 customers per minute.\n\nTherefore, \u03bb for 15 minutes is 0.2 customers/minute * 15 minutes = 3 customers.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me check. If the rate is 12 per hour, then in one minute, it's 12/60 = 0.2. So yes, in 15 minutes, it's 0.2 * 15 = 3. So \u03bb = 3.\n\nWe want the probability of exactly 3 customers in 15 minutes. So, k = 3.\n\nPlugging into the formula:\n\nP(3) = (3^3 * e^(-3)) / 3!\n\nCalculating that:\n\n3^3 = 27\n\ne^(-3) is approximately 0.0498\n\n3! = 6\n\nSo,\n\nP(3) \u2248 (27 * 0.0498) / 6\n\nLet me compute 27 * 0.0498 first.\n\n27 * 0.0498 \u2248 1.343\n\nThen divide by 6: 1.343 / 6 \u2248 0.2238\n\nSo, approximately 0.2238, or 22.38%.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me verify.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should calculate it more precisely.\n\ne^(-3) is about 0.049787.\n\nSo, 27 * 0.049787 = 1.340589\n\nDivide by 6: 1.340589 / 6 \u2248 0.223431\n\nYes, so about 0.2234, which is approximately 22.34%.\n\nOkay, that seems correct.\n\nSo, for part (a), the probability is approximately 0.2234.\n\nMoving on to part (b):\n\nGiven that 5 customers arrived during the first half hour, what is the probability that exactly 2 of them arrived during the first 15 minutes?\n\nHmm, conditional probability. So, given that in the first half hour (30 minutes), 5 customers arrived, what's the probability that exactly 2 arrived in the first 15 minutes.\n\nI think this is a conditional Poisson process. So, the process is memoryless, but given that in 30 minutes, 5 arrived, we can model the first 15 minutes and the second 15 minutes as two independent Poisson processes, each with \u03bb = 3 (since 12 per hour is 0.2 per minute, so 0.2 * 30 = 6 per half hour? Wait, no, wait. Wait, 12 per hour is 0.2 per minute. So, in 30 minutes, the expected number is 0.2 * 30 = 6. But we have 5 customers in 30 minutes.\n\nWait, but the question is, given that 5 arrived in 30 minutes, what is the probability that exactly 2 arrived in the first 15 minutes.\n\nSo, this is similar to splitting the 30 minutes into two 15-minute periods. Given that in total 5 arrived, how many arrived in the first 15 minutes.\n\nThis is like a binomial distribution, but with Poisson conditional probabilities.\n\nAlternatively, since the Poisson process is memoryless, the number of arrivals in the first 15 minutes and the second 15 minutes are independent Poisson variables, each with \u03bb = 3.\n\nBut given that the total in 30 minutes is 5, we can model this as a joint distribution.\n\nWait, actually, the number of arrivals in the first 15 minutes is X ~ Poisson(3), and in the second 15 minutes is Y ~ Poisson(3), with X and Y independent. But given that X + Y = 5, we need to find P(X=2 | X + Y =5).\n\nSo, the conditional probability P(X=2 | X + Y =5) = P(X=2 and X+Y=5) / P(X+Y=5)\n\nSince X and Y are independent Poisson variables with \u03bb=3, the joint distribution is Poisson with parameters (3,3), and the sum X+Y is Poisson with parameter 6.\n\nBut wait, in reality, the sum of two independent Poisson variables with parameters \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 is Poisson with parameter \u03bb1 + \u03bb2. So, X + Y ~ Poisson(6). So, P(X + Y =5) = e^(-6) * 6^5 / 5!\n\nBut wait, we need P(X=2 and X + Y=5). Since X can be 2, then Y must be 3, because 2 + 3 =5.\n\nSo, P(X=2 and Y=3) = P(X=2) * P(Y=3) since they are independent.\n\nP(X=2) = (3^2 e^(-3))/2! = (9 e^(-3))/2 \u2248 (9 * 0.0498)/2 \u2248 0.2245\n\nP(Y=3) = same as P(X=2) \u2248 0.2245\n\nSo, P(X=2 and Y=3) \u2248 0.2245 * 0.2245 \u2248 0.0505\n\nThen, P(X + Y=5) = e^(-6) * 6^5 / 5! \u2248 (0.002479) * (7776) / 120\n\nCompute 6^5 = 7776\n\n5! = 120\n\nSo, 7776 / 120 = 64.8\n\nThen, 0.002479 * 64.8 \u2248 0.1607\n\nSo, P(X=2 | X + Y=5) \u2248 0.0505 / 0.1607 \u2248 0.314\n\nSo, approximately 0.314, or 31.4%.\n\nWait, let me check that again.\n\nAlternatively, since X and Y are independent Poisson(3), the probability that X=2 and Y=3 is (e^(-3) * 3^2 / 2! ) * (e^(-3) * 3^3 / 3! )\n\nWhich is (e^(-6) * 9 / 2) * (e^(-6) * 27 / 6 )\n\nWait, no, that's not correct because X and Y are independent, so their joint probability is the product.\n\nWait, no, actually, X and Y are independent, so P(X=2 and Y=3) = P(X=2) * P(Y=3)\n\nWhich is [ (3^2 e^(-3))/2! ] * [ (3^3 e^(-3))/3! ]\n\nWhich is (9 e^(-3)/2) * (27 e^(-3)/6) = (9 * 27) e^(-6) / (2 * 6) = 243 e^(-6) / 12 \u2248 243 / 12 * e^(-6)\n\n243 /12 \u2248 20.25\n\ne^(-6) \u2248 0.002479\n\nSo, 20.25 * 0.002479 \u2248 0.0503\n\nThen, P(X + Y=5) = e^(-6) * 6^5 / 5! = e^(-6) * 7776 / 120 \u2248 0.002479 * 64.8 \u2248 0.1607\n\nSo, the conditional probability is 0.0503 / 0.1607 \u2248 0.313\n\nSo, approximately 0.313, which is about 31.3%.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to realize that given X + Y =5, the distribution of X is the same as a binomial distribution with n=2 and p=3/6=0.5, because each 15-minute interval has the same rate.\n\nWait, that might be a better way to think about it.\n\nIn the case of a Poisson process, the number of arrivals in non-overlapping intervals are independent Poisson variables. So, given that the total in 30 minutes is 5, the number in the first 15 minutes can be 0,1,2,3,4,5, but we're interested in 2.\n\nThe probability that X=2 given X + Y=5 is the same as the probability that in two independent trials with p=0.5 each, we get exactly 1 success (since 2 arrivals in first 15 minutes and 3 in the second, which is 2/5=0.4, but wait, that's not 0.5.\n\nWait, maybe that approach isn't directly applicable.\n\nAlternatively, since the Poisson process is memoryless, the number of arrivals in the first 15 minutes and the second 15 minutes are independent, each with \u03bb=3.\n\nGiven that X + Y =5, the conditional distribution of X is the same as a binomial distribution with n=2 and p=3/6=0.5, because each of the two intervals has the same rate.\n\nWait, that might be a way to model it.\n\nSo, if we have two independent Poisson variables X and Y with \u03bb=3 each, then X ~ Poisson(3), Y ~ Poisson(3), and X + Y ~ Poisson(6).\n\nGiven that X + Y =5, the conditional distribution of X is binomial with n=2 and p=0.5.\n\nBecause, in the case of two independent Poisson variables with the same \u03bb, the conditional distribution given their sum is binomial with p=\u03bb/(\u03bb + \u03bb') where \u03bb' is the other rate, but in this case, both \u03bb=3, so p=0.5.\n\nSo, P(X=k | X + Y =5) = C(2, k) * (0.5)^k * (0.5)^(2 -k) = C(2,k) * (0.5)^2\n\nWhich is the same as a fair coin flip for each arrival in the first 15 minutes.\n\nTherefore, P(X=2 | X + Y=5) = C(2,2) * (0.5)^2 = 1 * 0.25 = 0.25\n\nWait, that contradicts the previous result. Hmm, so which one is correct?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the conditional distribution isn't binomial in this case.\n\nWait, maybe the correct approach is to use the fact that for two independent Poisson variables X and Y with parameters \u03bb1 and \u03bb2, the conditional distribution of X given X + Y = n is a binomial distribution with parameters n=\u03bb1 and p=\u03bb1/(\u03bb1 + \u03bb2).\n\nIn this case, \u03bb1=\u03bb2=3, so p=0.5.\n\nTherefore, P(X=k | X + Y =5) = C(2, k) * (0.5)^k * (0.5)^(2 -k) = C(2,k) * (0.5)^2\n\nSo, for k=2, it's 1 * 0.25 = 0.25\n\nBut earlier, we calculated it as approximately 0.313. So, which one is correct?\n\nWait, let me think again.\n\nIf X and Y are independent Poisson(3), then the joint distribution is Poisson(6). So, P(X=2 and Y=3) = P(X=2)P(Y=3) = ( (3^2 e^{-3}) / 2! ) * ( (3^3 e^{-3}) / 3! ) = (9 e^{-3}/2) * (27 e^{-3}/6) = (243 e^{-6}) / 12 \u2248 0.0503\n\nAnd P(X + Y=5) = e^{-6} * 6^5 /5! \u2248 0.002479 * 7776 / 120 \u2248 0.1607\n\nSo, 0.0503 / 0.1607 \u2248 0.313\n\nBut if we model it as a binomial with p=0.5, we get 0.25.\n\nHmm, so which is correct?\n\nWait, actually, I think the first approach is correct because it's using the actual joint probabilities.\n\nThe binomial assumption might not hold here because the Poisson process is not a binomial process.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the conditional distribution is not exactly binomial, but in this specific case, it might approximate.\n\nWait, let me recall that when you have two independent Poisson variables X and Y with parameters \u03bb1 and \u03bb2, the conditional distribution of X given X + Y = n is binomial with parameters n=\u03bb1 and p=\u03bb1/(\u03bb1 + \u03bb2).\n\nIn this case, since \u03bb1=\u03bb2=3, p=0.5, so it's a fair coin flip.\n\nTherefore, P(X=2 | X + Y=5) = C(2,2) * (0.5)^2 = 0.25\n\nBut our earlier calculation gave 0.313, which is different.\n\nSo, there must be a mistake in one of the approaches.\n\nWait, perhaps the binomial approximation is not exact. Because in reality, the Poisson joint distribution is not the same as a binomial.\n\nWait, let me compute it exactly.\n\nThe exact probability is:\n\nP(X=2 | X + Y=5) = P(X=2 and Y=3) / P(X + Y=5)\n\nWe have:\n\nP(X=2 and Y=3) = [ (3^2 e^{-3}) / 2! ] * [ (3^3 e^{-3}) / 3! ] = (9 e^{-3}/2) * (27 e^{-3}/6) = (243 e^{-6}) / 12 \u2248 (243 / 12) * e^{-6} \u2248 20.25 * 0.002479 \u2248 0.0503\n\nP(X + Y=5) = e^{-6} * 6^5 /5! \u2248 0.002479 * 7776 / 120 \u2248 0.002479 * 64.8 \u2248 0.1607\n\nTherefore, the conditional probability is 0.0503 / 0.1607 \u2248 0.313\n\nSo, approximately 0.313, which is about 31.3%.\n\nBut if we model it as a binomial with p=0.5, we get 0.25, which is 25%.\n\nSo, which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps the binomial approximation is not exact here because the Poisson process is not the same as a binomial process.\n\nIn the Poisson case, the joint distribution is not the same as the product of two independent binomials.\n\nTherefore, the correct probability is approximately 0.313.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps another approach is to use the multinomial distribution.\n\nIn the case of Poisson processes, the number of arrivals in disjoint intervals are independent Poisson variables. So, given that in 30 minutes, 5 arrived, the number in the first 15 minutes can be 0,1,2,3,4,5, each with certain probabilities.\n\nBut to find the conditional probability that exactly 2 arrived in the first 15 minutes, we can use the formula:\n\nP(X=2 | X + Y=5) = P(X=2)P(Y=3) / P(X + Y=5)\n\nWhich is what we did earlier.\n\nSo, the correct answer is approximately 0.313.\n\nTherefore, the probability is approximately 0.313, or 31.3%.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\n(a) The probability is approximately 0.2234.\n\n(b) The conditional probability is approximately 0.313.\n\nI think that's the solution.\n</think>\n\n(a) The probability is approximately 0.2234.\n\n(b) The conditional probability is approximately 0.313.\n\nDONE."

The bakery opens at 8:00 AM. \n\n(a) What is the probability that the bakery receives exactly 3 customers in the first 15 minutes of operation?\n\n(b) Given that 5 customers arrived during the first half hour, what is the probability that exactly 2 of them arrived during the first 15 minutes? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this problem about a bakery that receives customers according to a Poisson process. The rate is 12 customers per hour. There are two parts to the problem, part (a) and part (b). Let me try to work through each step carefully.\n\nStarting with part (a): What is the probability that the bakery receives exactly 3 customers in the first 15 minutes of operation?\n\nOkay, so first, I remember that a Poisson process is a counting process that counts the number of events (in this case, customers) happening in a fixed interval of time. The Poisson process has parameters: the average rate (\u03bb) and the time between events (which is 1/\u03bb). Here, the rate is given as 12 customers per hour. So, let me calculate the rate per minute because the time interval we're interested in is 15 minutes.\n\nThere are 60 minutes in an hour, so the rate per minute would be 12 divided by 60, which is 0.2 customers per minute. So, \u03bb = 0.2 customers per minute.\n\nNow, the question is about the first 15 minutes. So, the interval we're considering is t = 15 minutes. We need to find the probability of exactly 3 customers arriving in this interval.\n\nI recall that the probability mass function (PMF) of a Poisson distribution is given by:\n\nP(k) = (e^(-\u03bbt) * (\u03bbt)^k) / k!\n\nWhere:\n- P(k) is the probability of k events occurring,\n- \u03bb is the average rate,\n- t is the time interval,\n- k! is the factorial of k.\n\nSo, plugging in the values we have:\n- \u03bb = 0.2 customers/minute,\n- t = 15 minutes,\n- k = 3.\n\nLet me compute this step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate \u03bbt:\n\u03bbt = 0.2 * 15 = 3.\n\nNext, compute e^(-\u03bbt):\ne^(-3) \u2248 0.049787.\n\nThen, compute (\u03bbt)^k:\n(3)^3 = 27.\n\nNow, compute k!:\n3! = 6.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\nP(3) = (0.049787 * 27) / 6.\n\nLet me calculate that:\n0.049787 * 27 \u2248 1.345.\n\nThen, divide by 6:\n1.345 / 6 \u2248 0.2242.\n\nSo, approximately 0.2242, or 22.42% chance.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, \u03bb is 12 per hour, so 12/60 is indeed 0.2 per minute. That's correct.\n\n\u03bbt is 0.2*15 = 3. That's correct.\n\ne^(-3) is approximately 0.049787. Yes, that's right.\n\n(\u03bbt)^k is 3^3 = 27. Correct.\n\nk! is 6. Correct.\n\nSo, 0.049787 * 27 = 1.345. Divided by 6 gives approximately 0.2242.\n\nSo, the probability is approximately 0.2242.\n\nAlternatively, if I use more precise values, e^(-3) is about 0.049787, so 0.049787 * 27 = 1.345, and 1.345 / 6 is 0.2241666..., which is approximately 0.2242.\n\nSo, I think that's correct.\n\nMoving on to part (b): Given that 5 customers arrived during the first half hour, what is the probability that exactly 2 of them arrived during the first 15 minutes?\n\nHmm, okay. So, this is a conditional probability problem. We are given that in the first half hour (which is 30 minutes), 5 customers arrived. We need to find the probability that exactly 2 of these 5 arrived in the first 15 minutes.\n\nSo, this seems like a Poisson process, and given that the number of customers in a certain interval is a Poisson random variable, but here we're given that the number in a larger interval (30 minutes) is 5, and we need to find the probability about a subset of that interval (15 minutes).\n\nWait, but in Poisson processes, the number of arrivals in disjoint intervals are independent. So, if we have the first 30 minutes, which is two 15-minute intervals, and we know that in total 5 customers arrived in the first 30 minutes, then the number of customers in the first 15 minutes and the second 15 minutes are independent Poisson variables.\n\nBut wait, actually, in a Poisson process, the number of arrivals in non-overlapping intervals are independent, but if the intervals overlap, they are not. However, in this case, the first 15 minutes and the next 15 minutes (from 15 to 30 minutes) are non-overlapping, so the number of arrivals in each are independent.\n\nTherefore, given that the total number in 30 minutes is 5, the number in the first 15 minutes and the second 15 minutes are independent Poisson variables with parameters \u03bb1 = 15 * 0.2 = 3 and \u03bb2 = 15 * 0.2 = 3. So, each 15-minute interval has a Poisson distribution with \u03bb=3.\n\nBut wait, actually, the number of arrivals in the first 30 minutes is the sum of two independent Poisson variables, each with \u03bb=3. So, the conditional probability that exactly 2 arrived in the first 15 minutes given that 5 arrived in the first 30 minutes is equivalent to the probability that in the first 15 minutes, 2 arrived, and in the second 15 minutes, 3 arrived.\n\nBecause 2 + 3 = 5.\n\nSo, the conditional probability P(exactly 2 in first 15 | total 5 in first 30) is equal to P(2 in first 15 and 3 in second 15 | total 5 in first 30).\n\nSince the two 15-minute intervals are independent, the joint probability is the product of the individual probabilities.\n\nSo, P(2 in first 15 and 3 in second 15) = P(2 in first 15) * P(3 in second 15).\n\nBut since both are Poisson with \u03bb=3, this is equal to [P(2) * P(3)].\n\nBut wait, let me think again.\n\nGiven that the total number in 30 minutes is 5, and the first 15 minutes and the second 15 minutes are independent, then the conditional probability is the probability that the first 15 minutes has 2 and the second has 3, divided by the total probability of all possible splits of 5 into two parts.\n\nWait, no. Actually, since the two periods are independent, the conditional probability that the first 15 minutes has k customers given that the total in 30 minutes is 5 is equal to the probability that the first 15 minutes has k and the second 15 minutes has (5 - k).\n\nBut because the two periods are independent, this is equal to P(k in first 15) * P(5 - k in second 15).\n\nBut since both have the same \u03bb=3, P(k) = P(5 - k). So, it's [P(k) * P(5 - k)].\n\nBut since the Poisson distribution is symmetric when \u03bb is the same, P(k) = P(5 - k) only if k = 5 - k, which is only when k=2.5, which isn't possible since k must be integer. So, that might not be the case.\n\nWait, no, the Poisson distribution is not symmetric unless \u03bb is such that it creates symmetry. But in this case, \u03bb=3, which is an integer, but the distribution isn't symmetric around 3. For example, P(0) = e^(-3) \u2248 0.0498, P(1) = 3e^(-3) \u2248 0.1494, P(2) = (9)e^(-3) \u2248 0.2247, P(3) = (27)e^(-3) \u2248 0.2247, P(4) = (81)e^(-3) \u2248 0.1494, P(5) = (243)e^(-3) \u2248 0.0498.\n\nSo, it's symmetric around \u03bb=3, but only in the sense that P(k) = P(5 - k) because the PMF is e^(-3) multiplied by the binomial coefficients.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nP(0) = e^(-3) \u2248 0.0498\n\nP(5) = 243e^(-3) \u2248 0.0498\n\nSimilarly, P(1)=3e^(-3)\u22480.1494 and P(4)=81e^(-3)\u22480.1494\n\nP(2)=9e^(-3)\u22480.2247 and P(3)=27e^(-3)\u22480.2247\n\nSo, yes, P(k) = P(5 - k). So, the distribution is symmetric around 2.5, which is the mean of 3.\n\nTherefore, P(k) = P(5 - k). So, the probability that in the first 15 minutes k customers arrived is the same as in the second 15 minutes (5 - k) customers arrived.\n\nTherefore, the conditional probability that exactly 2 arrived in the first 15 minutes given that 5 arrived in the first 30 minutes is equal to [P(2) * P(3)] divided by the total probability of all possible ways to split 5 into two parts.\n\nBut wait, no. Actually, since the two periods are independent, the joint probability P(2 in first 15 and 3 in second 15) is equal to P(2) * P(3), because the two are independent.\n\nBut we are given that the total is 5, so we have to normalize by the total probability of all possible splits.\n\nWait, but no, in conditional probability, given that the total is 5, the conditional probability is P(2 in first 15 and 3 in second 15) divided by P(total 5 in 30 minutes).\n\nBut since the two 15-minute periods are independent, P(2 in first 15 and 3 in second 15) = P(2) * P(3). Similarly, P(k in first 15 and (5 -k) in second 15) = P(k) * P(5 -k).\n\nBut since the distribution is symmetric, P(k) = P(5 -k), so the total probability is sum_{k=0}^5 P(k) * P(5 -k). But since P(k) = P(5 -k), this is equal to sum_{k=0}^5 [P(k)]^2.\n\nBut wait, actually, the total probability is the sum over all possible k of P(k in first 15 and (5 -k) in second 15). Since the two are independent, it's sum_{k=0}^5 P(k) * P(5 -k) = sum_{k=0}^5 [P(k)]^2 because P(k) = P(5 -k).\n\nBut actually, no. Let's think carefully.\n\nThe total probability P(total 5 in 30 minutes) is equal to sum_{k=0}^5 P(k in first 15) * P(5 -k in second 15) = sum_{k=0}^5 P(k) * P(5 -k).\n\nBut since the two periods are independent, the joint probability is the product of the individual probabilities.\n\nBut since the first 15 minutes and the second 15 minutes have the same \u03bb=3, P(k) = P(5 -k), so each term in the sum is P(k)^2.\n\nTherefore, the total probability is sum_{k=0}^5 [P(k)]^2.\n\nBut let me compute that.\n\nAlternatively, since the number of arrivals in the first 15 minutes is Poisson(3) and the number in the second 15 minutes is Poisson(3), and they are independent, the total number in 30 minutes is the sum of two independent Poisson(3) variables. The distribution of the sum is a Poisson(6) because Poisson processes add when the intervals are combined.\n\nWait, but the sum of two independent Poisson variables is not Poisson, but rather a Poisson compound distribution. Specifically, the sum of two independent Poisson(\u03bb1) and Poisson(\u03bb2) variables is Poisson(\u03bb1 + \u03bb2).\n\nSo, in this case, \u03bb1 = \u03bb2 = 3, so the sum is Poisson(6). Therefore, the probability of exactly 5 arrivals in 30 minutes is P(5 | Poisson(6)).\n\nWait, but that's a different approach. Let me think.\n\nIf the number of arrivals in the first 15 minutes is Poisson(3) and in the second 15 minutes is Poisson(3), independent, then the total number in 30 minutes is Poisson(6). Therefore, P(total 5) = P(5 | Poisson(6)).\n\nBut the question is, given that the total is 5, what is the probability that exactly 2 arrived in the first 15 minutes.\n\nSo, using the law of total probability, we can write:\n\nP(2 in first 15 | total 5) = P(2 in first 15 and 3 in second 15) / P(total 5).\n\nBut since the two are independent, P(2 and 3) = P(2) * P(3). And P(total 5) is the probability that the sum is 5, which is the sum over k=0 to 5 of P(k in first 15) * P(5 -k in second 15).\n\nBut since the two are independent and Poisson(3), P(k) * P(5 -k) is the same as P(k) * P(5 -k). But since the distribution is symmetric, as we saw earlier, P(k) = P(5 -k), so each term is [P(k)]^2.\n\nTherefore, P(total 5) = sum_{k=0}^5 [P(k)]^2.\n\nSo, let me compute P(2) and P(3), square them, sum over k=0 to 5.\n\nFirst, let's compute P(k) for k=0,1,2,3,4,5.\n\nWe have \u03bb=3, so:\n\nP(0) = e^(-3) \u2248 0.049787\n\nP(1) = e^(-3) * 3 \u2248 0.149359\n\nP(2) = e^(-3) * 9 \u2248 0.224779\n\nP(3) = e^(-3) * 27 \u2248 0.224779\n\nP(4) = e^(-3) * 81 \u2248 0.149359\n\nP(5) = e^(-3) * 243 \u2248 0.049787\n\nSo, P(0)=P(5)=~0.049787\n\nP(1)=P(4)=~0.149359\n\nP(2)=P(3)=~0.224779\n\nNow, compute [P(k)]^2 for each k and sum them up.\n\nCompute each [P(k)]^2:\n\n[P(0)]^2 \u2248 (0.049787)^2 \u2248 0.002487\n\n[P(1)]^2 \u2248 (0.149359)^2 \u2248 0.022237\n\n[P(2)]^2 \u2248 (0.224779)^2 \u2248 0.050533\n\n[P(3)]^2 \u2248 (0.224779)^2 \u2248 0.050533\n\n[P(4)]^2 \u2248 (0.149359)^2 \u2248 0.022237\n\n[P(5)]^2 \u2248 (0.049787)^2 \u2248 0.002487\n\nNow, sum all these up:\n\n0.002487 + 0.022237 + 0.050533 + 0.050533 + 0.022237 + 0.002487\n\nLet me add them step by step:\n\nStart with 0.002487 + 0.022237 = 0.024724\n\nAdd 0.050533: 0.024724 + 0.050533 \u2248 0.075257\n\nAdd 0.050533: 0.075257 + 0.050533 \u2248 0.12579\n\nAdd 0.022237: 0.12579 + 0.022237 \u2248 0.148027\n\nAdd 0.002487: 0.148027 + 0.002487 \u2248 0.150514\n\nSo, the total probability P(total 5) \u2248 0.150514.\n\nNow, the numerator is P(2 in first 15 and 3 in second 15) = P(2) * P(3) \u2248 0.224779 * 0.224779 \u2248 0.050533.\n\nWait, no. Wait, P(2 in first 15) is 0.224779, and P(3 in second 15) is also 0.224779, so their product is 0.224779^2 \u2248 0.050533.\n\nTherefore, the conditional probability is 0.050533 / 0.150514 \u2248 0.3366.\n\nSo, approximately 0.3366, or 33.66%.\n\nWait, let me check that again.\n\nWait, no, because P(2 in first 15) is 0.224779, and P(3 in second 15) is also 0.224779. So, the joint probability is 0.224779 * 0.224779 \u2248 0.050533.\n\nBut the total probability P(total 5) is 0.150514, so the conditional probability is 0.050533 / 0.150514 \u2248 0.3366.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, since the Poisson process is memoryless, the distribution of the number in the first 15 minutes given the total in 30 minutes might have a certain property, but I think the approach I took is correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that the conditional distribution of the number in the first 15 minutes given the total in 30 minutes is equivalent to the distribution of the number in the first 15 minutes when the total is fixed. Since the two 15-minute intervals are independent, the number in each is Poisson(3), so the conditional distribution is the same as the marginal distribution of one of the Poisson(3) variables.\n\nWait, no, because we are conditioning on the total, which is the sum of two independent Poisson(3) variables.\n\nBut actually, if we know that the total is 5, then the number in the first 15 minutes can be 0,1,2,3"
