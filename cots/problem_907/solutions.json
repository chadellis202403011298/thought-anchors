If a person receives a positive test result, what is the probability that they actually have the disease? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nFirst, I recognize that this is a probability question involving conditional probabilities. To determine the probability that a person actually has the disease given a positive test result, I can use Bayes' Theorem.\n\nBayes' Theorem is expressed as:\nP(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)\n\nIn this scenario:\n- Event A is the person having the disease.\n- Event B is testing positive.\n\nSo, P(A|B) represents the probability of having the disease given a positive test result.\n\nI know the following probabilities:\n- The prevalence of the disease in the population is 1%, so P(A) = 0.01.\n- The test has a sensitivity of 95%, meaning P(B|A) = 0.95.\n- The test has a specificity of 95%, meaning that 5% of the time, people without the disease are incorrectly identified as positive. Therefore, P(B|not A) = 0.05.\n\nUsing these values, I can calculate P(B), the total probability of testing positive, which includes both true positives and false positives:\nP(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A)\nP(B) = 0.95 * 0.01 + 0.05 * 0.99\nP(B) = 0.0095 + 0.0495\nP(B) = 0.059\n\nNow, applying Bayes' Theorem to find P(A|B):\nP(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)\nP(A|B) = 0.95 * 0.01 / 0.059\nP(A|B) \u2248 0.016\n\nTherefore, the probability that a person actually has the disease given a positive test result is approximately 1.6%.\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\nTo determine the probability that a person actually has the disease given a positive test result, we can use **Bayes' Theorem**. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Define the probabilities:**\n   - **Sensitivity (True Positive Rate):** 95% or 0.95\n   - **Specificity (True Negative Rate):** 95% or 0.95\n   - **Prevalence of the disease in the population:** 1% or 0.01\n\n2. **Calculate the total probability of testing positive (P(B)):**\n   \\[\n   P(B) = P(B|A) \\times P(A) + P(B|\\neg A) \\times P(\\neg A)\n   \\]\n   - \\( P(B|A) = 0.95 \\) (True Positive)\n   - \\( P(A) = 0.01 \\) (Probability of having the disease)\n   - \\( P(B|\\neg A) = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05 \\) (False Positive)\n   - \\( P(\\neg A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.99 \\) (Probability of not having the disease)\n\n   Plugging in the values:\n   \\[\n   P(B) = 0.95 \\times 0.01 + 0.05 \\times 0.99 = 0.0095 + 0.0495 = 0.059\n   \\]\n\n3. **Apply Bayes' Theorem to find the probability of having the disease given a positive test result (\\(P(A|B)\\)):**\n   \\[\n   P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A) \\times P(A)}{P(B)} = \\frac{0.95 \\times 0.01}{0.059} \\approx 0.016\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe probability that a person actually has the disease given a positive test result is approximately \\(\\boxed{1.6\\%}\\).\n\nDONE."

If a person receives a positive test result, what is the probability that they actually have the disease? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nTo determine the probability that a person actually has the disease given a positive test result, I'll use the formula for conditional probability. \n\nFirst, let's define the events:\n- Let D represent the event that a person has the disease.\n- Let T represent the event that the test is positive.\n\nThe probability of having the disease is 1%, or 0.01. The test's sensitivity is 95%, meaning that 95% of the time, the test correctly identifies a diseased person as positive. Therefore, P(T | D) = 0.95.\n\nThe probability of not having the disease is 99%, or 0.99. The test's specificity is 95%, meaning that 95% of the time, a healthy person is correctly identified as negative. Therefore, P(T | not D) = 0.05.\n\nUsing Bayes' Theorem, the probability of having the disease given a positive test result is calculated as:\nP(D | T) = [P(T | D) * P(D)] / [P(T | D) * P(D) + P(T | not D) * P(not D)].\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\nP(D | T) = (0.95 * 0.01) / (0.95 * 0.01 + 0.05 * 0.99).\n\nCalculating the numerator: 0.95 * 0.01 = 0.0095.\n\nCalculating the denominator: 0.95 * 0.01 + 0.05 * 0.99 = 0.0095 + 0.0495 = 0.059.\n\nTherefore, P(D | T) = 0.0095 / 0.059 \u2248 0.1613, or 16.13%.\n\nSo, there's approximately a 16.13% chance that a person who tested positive actually has the disease.\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\nTo determine the probability that a person actually has the disease given a positive test result, we can use **Bayes' Theorem**.

If a person receives a positive test result, what is the probability that they actually have the disease? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out the probability that someone actually has the disease given that they tested positive. Hmm, okay, let's break this down. I remember this is a classic probability question involving conditional probabilities, so maybe I should use Bayes' Theorem here.\n\nFirst, let me note down the given information. The disease affects 1% of the population. That means the prevalence of the disease is 1%, or 0.01 in decimal form. The test has a sensitivity of 95%, which means that if someone has the disease, the test will correctly identify them as positive 95% of the time. The specificity is also 95%, meaning that if someone doesn't have the disease, the test will correctly identify them as negative 95% of the time.\n\nSo, we're looking for the probability that a person has the disease given that they tested positive. In probability terms, that's P(Disease | Positive). According to Bayes' Theorem, this is equal to:\n\nP(Disease | Positive) = [P(Positive | Disease) * P(Disease)] / P(Positive)\n\nI already know P(Positive | Disease) is 95% or 0.95, and P(Disease) is 1% or 0.01. But I need to find P(Positive), the total probability of testing positive. This can happen in two ways: either the person has the disease and tests positive, or they don't have the disease but still test positive. So, P(Positive) = P(Positive | Disease) * P(Disease) + P(Positive | No Disease) * P(No Disease).\n\nI know P(Positive | Disease) is 0.95 and P(Disease) is 0.01. P(Positive | No Disease) is the complement of specificity, which is 5%, or 0.05, since specificity is 95% for not having the disease. P(No Disease) is 1 - P(Disease) = 0.99.\n\nPutting these numbers together:\n\nP(Positive) = (0.95 * 0.01) + (0.05 * 0.99)\n\nLet me calculate each part:\n\n0.95 * 0.01 = 0.0095\n\n0.05 * 0.99 = 0.0495\n\nAdding them up: 0.0095 + 0.0495 = 0.059\n\nSo, P(Positive) is 0.059 or 5.9%.\n\nNow, applying Bayes' Theorem:\n\nP(Disease | Positive) = (0.95 * 0.01) / 0.059 = 0.0095 / 0.059\n\nCalculating that: 0.0095 divided by 0.059. Let me do that division.\n\n0.0095 \u00f7 0.059. Hmm, 0.059 goes into 0.095 about 1.6 times because 0.059 * 1.6 = 0.0944, which is close to 0.095. So, approximately 1.01695%.\n\nWait, let me double-check that calculation. 0.059 multiplied by 1.01695 should give approximately 0.059. Let's see:\n\n0.059 * 1.01695 \u2248 0.059 * 1.017 \u2248 0.0598, which is about 0.059. So, that seems right.\n\nSo, the probability that someone actually has the disease given a positive test result is approximately 1.01695%, which is about 1.017%.\n\nI think that makes sense because even though the test is quite accurate, the disease is rare, so most positive tests are false positives. That's why the probability isn't very high despite the test's high accuracy.\n\nSo, to summarize, I used Bayes' Theorem, calculated the total probability of testing positive, and then divided the probability of testing positive given the disease by that total. The result is a low probability, which aligns with the low prevalence of the disease.\n</think>\n\nThe probability that a person actually has the disease given a positive test result is approximately 1.02%.\n\n**Answer:** 1.02%  \nDONE."
