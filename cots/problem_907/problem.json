  "question": "A hospital offers a screening test for a rare disease that affects 1% of the population. The test is 95% accurate, meaning that if a person has the disease, the test will correctly identify them as positive 95% of the time (sensitivity), and if a person does not have the disease, the test will correctly identify them as negative 95% of the time (specificity). If a person receives a positive test result, what is the probability that they actually have the disease?",
  "answer": "To solve this problem, we need to use Bayes' theorem to find the probability of having the disease given a positive test result.\n\nLet's define our events:\n- D = having the disease\n- T = testing positive\n\nWe want to find P(D|T), the probability of having the disease given a positive test result.\n\nAccording to Bayes' theorem:\nP(D|T) = [P(T|D) \u00d7 P(D)] / P(T)\n\nWe know:\n- P(D) = 0.01 (1% of the population has the disease)\n- P(T|D) = 0.95 (95% sensitivity - if you have the disease, the test will be positive 95% of the time)\n- P(T|not D) = 0.05 (5% false positive rate - if you don't have the disease, the test will still be positive 5% of the time)\n\nWe need to calculate P(T), the overall probability of testing positive. We can compute this using the law of total probability:\nP(T) = P(T|D) \u00d7 P(D) + P(T|not D) \u00d7 P(not D)\nP(T) = 0.95 \u00d7 0.01 + 0.05 \u00d7 0.99\nP(T) = 0.0095 + 0.0495\nP(T) = 0.059\n\nNow we can calculate P(D|T):\nP(D|T) = [P(T|D) \u00d7 P(D)] / P(T)\nP(D|T) = (0.95 \u00d7 0.01) / 0.059\nP(D|T) = 0.0095 / 0.059\nP(D|T) \u2248 0.161 or about 16.1%\n\nTherefore, if a person receives a positive test result, there is only about a 16.1% probability that they actually have the disease. This illustrates the base rate fallacy - even with a seemingly accurate test, when the disease is rare, most positive results will be false positives."
