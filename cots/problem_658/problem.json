  "question": "Consider the following sequence: A, E, I, M, Q, _____. What letter should replace the blank to continue the pattern?",
  "answer": "The correct letter is U.\n\nStep 1: Let's assign each letter its position in the alphabet:\nA = 1\nE = 5\nI = 9\nM = 13\nQ = 17\n\nStep 2: Analyze the pattern by finding the difference between consecutive letters:\nE - A = 5 - 1 = 4\nI - E = 9 - 5 = 4\nM - I = 13 - 9 = 4\nQ - M = 17 - 13 = 4\n\nStep 3: The pattern shows that each letter is 4 positions ahead of the previous letter in the alphabet.\n\nStep 4: To find the next letter after Q (which is position 17), we add 4:\n17 + 4 = 21\n\nStep 5: The 21st letter in the alphabet is U.\n\nTherefore, U is the next letter in the sequence."
