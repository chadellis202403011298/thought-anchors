  "question": "A researcher wants to determine whether a new study method improves test scores. She randomly assigns 100 high school students to two groups: 50 students use the new study method (treatment group), while 50 students use their regular study methods (control group). After two weeks, all students take the same test, and the treatment group scores 8 points higher on average than the control group. However, when analyzing the data further, the researcher discovers that the treatment group spent an average of 3 more hours studying than the control group during the two-week period. What is the primary flaw in this experimental design, and how could the researcher modify the design to better determine whether the new study method itself (rather than study time) causes improved test scores?",
  "answer": "The primary flaw in this experimental design is a confounding variable: study time. The experiment cannot distinguish whether the improved test scores in the treatment group were caused by the new study method or simply by the additional study time. Since the treatment group studied for more hours than the control group, we cannot isolate the effect of the study method itself.\n\nTo address this flaw, the researcher could modify the experimental design in one of the following ways:\n\n1. Control for study time: Instruct both groups to study for exactly the same amount of time (e.g., exactly 10 hours over the two-week period). This would eliminate study time as a confounding variable.\n\n2. Match study time between groups: After the experiment, match students from each group who studied for similar amounts of time, and compare their scores. This creates comparable subgroups where study time is not a confounding factor.\n\n3. Use study time as a covariate: Apply statistical methods like ANCOVA (Analysis of Covariance) to adjust for the effect of study time when analyzing test score differences.\n\n4. Factorial design: Create four groups instead of two: (1) new method with standard study time, (2) new method with extended study time, (3) old method with standard study time, and (4) old method with extended study time. This would allow the researcher to examine the effects of both the study method and study time, as well as their potential interaction.\n\nBy implementing any of these modifications, the researcher would be better able to determine whether the new study method itself causes improved test scores, independent of study time."
