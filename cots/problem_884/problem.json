  "question": "During a town meeting debate about building a new community center, one resident made the following statement: 'The mayor supports this community center project, and she's been involved in local politics for over 20 years. Clearly, the community center is a good idea and we should all support it.' What logical fallacy is present in this argument?",
  "answer": "This argument contains the Appeal to Authority fallacy. The resident is claiming that the community center is a good idea primarily because the mayor (an authority figure) supports it and has many years of experience in politics. \n\nStep 1: Identify the conclusion of the argument - 'the community center is a good idea and we should all support it.'\n\nStep 2: Identify the premises offered to support this conclusion - 'The mayor supports this project' and 'She's been involved in local politics for over 20 years.'\n\nStep 3: Analyze whether the premises logically support the conclusion. In this case, they do not. The fact that an authority figure (the mayor) supports something doesn't automatically make it a good idea. \n\nStep 4: Recognize that this type of reasoning relies solely on the status or position of the person making the claim rather than on the merits of the community center project itself.\n\nThe Appeal to Authority fallacy occurs when someone claims something is true or good simply because an authority figure or expert says it is, without providing actual evidence or reasoning about the issue itself."
