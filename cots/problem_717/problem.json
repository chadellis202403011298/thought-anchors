  "question": "A small neighborhood library has received a donation of $1,200 to improve its children's section. The librarian needs to decide how to allocate this money among three options: new books ($20 each), educational games ($40 each), and comfortable seating cushions ($60 each). Based on feedback from patrons, the library should have at least twice as many books as games, and at least one cushion for every four books. What is the maximum number of total items (books, games, and cushions combined) that the library can purchase while staying within budget and meeting all requirements?",
  "answer": "Let's denote the number of books as B, games as G, and cushions as C.\n\nGiven:\n- Books cost $20 each\n- Games cost $40 each\n- Cushions cost $60 each\n- Total budget is $1,200\n- Need at least twice as many books as games: B \u2265 2G\n- Need at least one cushion for every four books: C \u2265 B/4\n\nThe budget constraint is:\n20B + 40G + 60C \u2264 1200\n\nWe want to maximize the total number of items: B + G + C\n\nSince we're trying to maximize the total number of items and books are the cheapest, we should use the constraints as equalities:\n1. B = 2G (minimum books requirement)\n2. C = B/4 (minimum cushions requirement)\n\nSubstituting equation 1 into equation 2:\nC = (2G)/4 = G/2\n\nNow, let's substitute these into the budget constraint:\n20(2G) + 40G + 60(G/2) \u2264 1200\n40G + 40G + 30G \u2264 1200\n110G \u2264 1200\nG \u2264 10.9\n\nSince G must be a whole number, G = 10 (maximum)\n\nTherefore:\n- G = 10 games\n- B = 2G = 20 books\n- C = G/2 = 5 cushions\n\nTotal items = B + G + C = 20 + 10 + 5 = 35 items\n\nLet's verify the budget constraint:\n20(20) + 40(10) + 60(5) = 400 + 400 + 300 = 1100 \u2264 1200\n\nThis solution satisfies all requirements and uses $1,100 of the $1,200 budget. The maximum number of total items the library can purchase is 35."
