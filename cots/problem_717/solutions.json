End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: A small neighborhood library has received a donation of $1,200 to improve its children's section. The librarian needs to decide how to allocate this money among three options: new books ($20 each), educational games ($40 each), and comfortable seating cushions ($60 each). Based on feedback from patrons, the library should have at least twice as many books as games, and at least one cushion for every four books. What is the maximum number of total items (books, games, and cushions combined) that the library can purchase while staying within budget and meeting all requirements? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I've got this problem here about a library that received $1200 to improve their children's section. They need to decide how to allocate this money among three things: new books at $20 each, educational games at $40 each, and comfortable seating cushions at $60 each. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out how to maximize the total number of items they can buy while staying within the budget and meeting the requirements. The requirements are that they should have at least twice as many books as games, and at least one cushion for every four books. \n\nOkay, let me break this down. Let's denote the number of books as B, the number of games as G, and the number of cushions as C. \n\nSo, the first requirement is that the number of books is at least twice the number of games. That gives me the inequality:\nB \u2265 2G\n\nThe second requirement is that there's at least one cushion for every four books. So, for every four books, they need one cushion. That means the number of cushions should be at least one quarter of the number of books. So:\nC \u2265 (1/4)B\n\nAlso, the total money spent shouldn't exceed $1200. Each book is $20, each game is $40, and each cushion is $60. So, the total cost equation would be:\n20B + 40G + 60C \u2264 1200\n\nOur goal is to maximize the total number of items, which is B + G + C.\n\nSo, to recap:\n1. B \u2265 2G\n2. C \u2265 (1/4)B\n3. 20B + 40G + 60C \u2264 1200\n4. Maximize B + G + C\n\nI think a good approach here is to express everything in terms of one variable, maybe G, since B is already related to G, and C is related to B. Let's try that.\n\nFrom the first inequality, B \u2265 2G. Let's express B as 2G + x, where x is some non-negative integer (since you can't have a fraction of a book). So, B = 2G + x.\n\nFrom the second inequality, C \u2265 (1/4)B. Since B is 2G + x, then C \u2265 (1/4)(2G + x) = (G + x/4). Since C has to be an integer, we can write C = G + x/4 + y, where y is a non-negative integer. But this might get complicated. Maybe it's better to express C in terms of B, so C = (1/4)B + z, where z is a non-negative integer. But since B and C are integers, (1/4)B must also be an integer or we can round up. Hmm, but perhaps I can model it as C = ceil((1/4)B). But that might complicate things with ceiling functions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express C as exactly (1/4)B, but that might not always be possible because B might not be a multiple of 4. So, perhaps it's better to model it as C \u2265 (1/4)B, meaning that for every B, C is at least that, so to minimize C, we can take C = (1/4)B, but we have to ensure that B is a multiple of 4. If B isn't a multiple of 4, then C would be the ceiling of (1/4)B. But since B is a function of G, which is another variable, this could get tricky.\n\nMaybe a better approach is to express everything in terms of G, and then find the minimum possible C given B, and then see how much money is left for games.\n\nLet me try that. Let's express B as 2G, since B must be at least twice G. So, B = 2G.\n\nThen, from the cushion requirement, C \u2265 (1/4)B = (1/4)(2G) = G/2.\n\nBut C has to be an integer, so if G is even, C can be G/2. If G is odd, C would be (G+1)/2. But to keep it simple, let's assume that G is even for now, so C = G/2.\n\nBut wait, if G is even, then C = G/2. If G is odd, C would be (G+1)/2, which is a ceiling function. This might complicate things, but perhaps we can proceed by considering G even first.\n\nSo, let's assume G is even. Then, B = 2G and C = G/2.\n\nNow, the total cost would be:\n\n20B + 40G + 60C = 20*(2G) + 40G + 60*(G/2) = 40G + 40G + 30G = 110G.\n\nSo, 110G \u2264 1200.\n\nThus, G \u2264 1200 / 110 \u2248 10.909. Since G must be an integer, G \u2264 10.\n\nBut wait, if G is 10, then B = 20, and C = 5.\n\nTotal items: 20 + 10 + 5 = 35.\n\nBut wait, let's check if this is the maximum. Because if G is 10, that's 35 items.\n\nBut perhaps if G is less, say 8, then B=16, C=4.\n\nTotal cost: 20*16 + 40*8 + 60*4 = 320 + 320 + 240 = 880. That leaves $320 unspent, which could be used to buy more items. But according to our earlier calculation, when G=10, the total cost is 110*10=1100, which is within $1200. So, that's better.\n\nWait, but if G=10, then B=20, C=5, total cost=20*20 +40*10 +60*5=400+400+300=1100, leaving $100 unspent.\n\nBut is there a way to spend that $100 to get more items?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can adjust the numbers to see if I can get more total items.\n\nWait, perhaps I should not assume that C is exactly G/2, but instead model it as C = ceil(B/4). So, let's see.\n\nIf B=2G, then C = ceil(2G/4) = ceil(G/2). So, if G is even, C=G/2. If G is odd, C=(G+1)/2.\n\nSo, for G=10, C=5, as before.\n\nBut perhaps if G is 11, then B=22, and C=ceil(22/4)=6 (since 22/4=5.5, so ceiling is 6).\n\nTotal cost: 20*22 +40*11 +60*6=440 +440 +360=1240, which is over the budget.\n\nSo, that's too much.\n\nIf G=9, then B=18, C=ceil(18/4)=5 (since 18/4=4.5, so ceiling is 5).\n\nTotal cost: 20*18 +40*9 +60*5=360 +360 +300=1020.\n\nThat leaves $180 unspent.\n\nTotal items: 18+9+5=32.\n\nWhich is more than the 35 when G=10? Wait, no, 32 is less than 35.\n\nWait, but when G=10, we had 20+10+5=35, total cost 1100, leaving $100.\n\nSo, perhaps we can use that $100 to buy more items.\n\nWait, but how? Because the problem is that the total cost is 1100, so we have $100 left. But we can't just buy more books, games, or cushions without violating the requirements.\n\nSo, perhaps we can adjust the numbers to see if we can use that extra $100.\n\nLet me think differently. Let's let G be a variable, and express B and C in terms of G.\n\nFrom the first requirement: B \u2265 2G.\n\nFrom the second: C \u2265 B/4.\n\nLet me express B as 2G + x, where x \u22650.\n\nThen, C \u2265 (2G +x)/4 = G/2 + x/4.\n\nSince x must be an integer, x/4 can be a fraction, so C must be at least the ceiling of G/2 + x/4.\n\nBut this might get too complicated. Maybe a better approach is to model B and C in terms of G, and then find the combination that maximizes B+G+C while staying within the budget.\n\nLet me try to express everything in terms of G.\n\nLet\u2019s denote G as the number of games. Then, B must be at least 2G, so B=2G + a, where a \u22650.\n\nC must be at least B/4, so C= (2G +a)/4 + b, where b \u22650. But since C must be an integer, we can write C=ceil((2G +a)/4).\n\nBut this seems too abstract. Maybe instead, for each possible G, find the minimum B and C required, calculate the total cost, and see if it's within budget. Then, among all possible G that fit, choose the one that gives the maximum total items.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can set up equations to model this.\n\nLet me consider that B=2G and C=G/2, assuming G is even. Then, total cost is 20*(2G) +40G +60*(G/2)=40G +40G +30G=110G.\n\nSet 110G \u22641200 \u2192 G \u226410.909, so G=10.\n\nTotal items:20+10+5=35.\n\nIf G=10, B=20, C=5, total cost=400+400+300=1100, leaving $100.\n\nBut perhaps we can increase some items.\n\nFor example, with G=10, B=20, C=5, total items=35, total cost=1100.\n\nWe have $100 left. Maybe we can use this to buy more books, games, or cushions.\n\nBut we need to maintain the ratio of B\u22652G and C\u2265B/4.\n\nSo, let's see:\n\nIf we have $100 left, can we buy more books? Each book is $20, so 100/20=5. So, we can buy 5 more books, making B=25.\n\nBut then, B=25, which is still \u22652G=20, so that's okay.\n\nNow, C must be at least 25/4=6.25, so C=7.\n\nSo, previously, C=5, now we need to increase C to 7.\n\nThe cost of C was 5*60=300, now it's 7*60=420, so the additional cost is 120, which exceeds the $100 we have left. So, that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe buy some games instead.\n\nWe have $100 left, and each game is $40, so 100/40=2.5, so we can buy 2 more games, making G=12.\n\nBut then, B must be at least 2*12=24. Previously, B was 20, so we need to increase B by 4, which would cost 4*20=80.\n\nBut we only have $100 left, so 80+20=100 (buying 4 books and 2 games). Wait, but buying 4 books would make B=24, and buying 2 games would make G=12.\n\nThen, C must be at least 24/4=6.\n\nPreviously, C=5, now we need C=6.\n\nThe cost for C would be 6*60=360, which previously was 5*60=300, so additional cost is 60, which is within the $100.\n\nSo, total cost would be 1100 +80 +40=1220, which is over the budget. So, that's not allowed.\n\nWait, no, because the initial total was 1100, and we have $100 left. So, if we buy 4 books at $80 and 2 games at $80, total additional cost is $160, which is more than $100. So, that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe buy 2 games at $80 (since 2*40=80), making G=12, and then B needs to be at least 24, so we need to buy 4 more books at $80, which would make the total additional cost $160, which is too much.\n\nSo, that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe buy 2 games at $80, and then use the remaining $20 to buy 1 book, making B=21, which is still \u22652*10=20.\n\nBut then, C needs to be at least 21/4=5.25, so C=6.\n\nSo, previously, C=5, now C=6, costing 60 more, which would require $80 (for 2 games) + $20 (for 1 book) + $60 (for 1 extra cushion) = $160, which again is over the budget.\n\nHmm, perhaps instead of trying to increase G, maybe buy more cushions.\n\nWe have $100 left. Each cushion is $60, so 100/60\u22481.666, so we can buy 1 more cushion, making C=6.\n\nThen, B remains 20, G remains 10.\n\nBut B=20, so C must be at least 5, which is satisfied. So, total cost would be 1100 +60=1160, leaving $40.\n\nThen, with $40 left, we can buy 2 more games at $40 each, making G=12.\n\nNow, B needs to be at least 24, so we need to buy 4 more books at $80, but we only have $40 left. So, that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, with $40 left, buy 1 game at $40, making G=11, and then B needs to be at least 22, so we need to buy 2 more books at $40, but that would require $80, which we don't have. So, that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, with $40 left, buy 1 book at $20, making B=21, and then C needs to be at least 21/4=5.25, so C=6, which would cost an additional $60, which we don't have. So, that's not possible.\n\nHmm, this seems tricky. Maybe instead of trying to increase G, we can see if there's a better combination.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps starting with G=8.\n\nSo, G=8, B=16, C=4.\n\nTotal cost:20*16 +40*8 +60*4=320+320+240=880.\n\nLeaving $320 unspent.\n\nThen, with $320 left, we can buy more items.\n\nEach book is $20, so 16 more books would cost $320, making B=32.\n\nThen, C needs to be at least 32/4=8.\n\nSo, C=8, costing 480, which would require 480 from the $320, which is not possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe buy a mix of books, games, and cushions.\n\nFor example, buy 16 books at $320, but that's too much.\n\nAlternatively, buy 16 books at $320, but that's the entire $320, so B=32, C=8.\n\nBut total cost would be 880 +320 +480=1780, which is way over the budget.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps buy some games and some cushions.\n\nWait, but maybe it's better to stick with G=10, B=20, C=5, total items=35, total cost=1100, leaving $100.\n\nIs there a way to spend that $100 to get more items?\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe instead of setting B=2G, we can allow B to be more than 2G to use the extra money for more items.\n\nWait, but the requirement is B \u22652G, so B can be more, but it's better to set B=2G to minimize the number of books and maximize the number of games, which are cheaper.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps buying more cushions can allow us to buy more items.\n\nWait, but cushions are the most expensive, so to maximize items, we should buy as few cushions as required.\n\nSo, perhaps the initial approach is the best: set B=2G, C=G/2, and then find the maximum G such that 20B +40G +60C \u22641200.\n\nSo, with B=2G, C=G/2.\n\nTotal cost=20*(2G) +40G +60*(G/2)=40G +40G +30G=110G.\n\nSet 110G \u22641200 \u2192 G \u226410.909, so G=10.\n\nThen, B=20, C=5, total items=35, total cost=1100, leaving $100.\n\nIs there a way to use that $100 to get more items?\n\nLet me see: with $100, we can buy 5 more books, making B=25.\n\nBut then, C must be at least 25/4=6.25, so C=7.\n\nSo, buying 5 books and 2 more cushions (since C increased by 2, costing 120, which is over the $100).\n\nAlternatively, buy 5 books and 1 cushion, costing 5*20 +1*60=100 +60=160, which is too much.\n\nAlternatively, buy 4 books and 1 cushion: 4*20 +1*60=80+60=140, still too much.\n\nAlternatively, buy 3 books and 1 cushion: 60+60=120, which is over.\n\nAlternatively, buy 2 books and 1 cushion: 40+60=100, which is exactly the $100.\n\nSo, buy 2 books and 1 cushion.\n\nThen, B=22, G=10, C=6.\n\nCheck the requirements:\n\nB=22 \u22652*10=20: yes.\n\nC=6 \u226522/4=5.5: yes.\n\nTotal cost: 20*22 +40*10 +60*6=440+400+360=1200.\n\nPerfect, exactly $1200.\n\nTotal items:22+10+6=38.\n\nThat's better than the initial 35.\n\nSo, that's a better allocation.\n\nSo, B=22, G=10, C=6.\n\nTotal items=38.\n\nIs that the maximum?\n\nLet me check if I can get more items.\n\nSuppose I try G=11.\n\nThen, B must be at least 22.\n\nC must be at least 22/4=5.5, so C=6.\n\nTotal cost:20*22 +40*11 +60*6=440+440+360=1240>1200.\n\nToo much.\n\nSo, G=11 is too much.\n\nWhat about G=9?\n\nB="

They need to allocate this money among three options: new books at $20 each, educational games at $40 each, and comfortable seating cushions at $60 each. The librarian needs to make sure that there are at least twice as many books as games and at least one cushion for every four books. The goal is to find the maximum number of total items they can purchase without exceeding the budget and meeting all the requirements.\n\nOkay, let me break this down. First, I need to set up some variables to represent the quantities of each item. Let's say:\n\n- Let \\( b \\) be the number of books.\n- Let \\( g \\) be the number of games.\n- Let \\( c \\) be the number of cushions.\n\nNow, the costs are given per item, so the total cost can be represented by the equation:\n\n\\( 20b + 40g + 60c \\leq 1200 \\)\n\nThat's our budget constraint. Now, the next part is the requirements. The first requirement is that there should be at least twice as many books as games. So that translates to:\n\n\\( b \\geq 2g \\)\n\nOr, in other words,\n\n\\( b \\geq 2g \\)\n\nThe second requirement is that there should be at least one cushion for every four books. So, for every four books, there's at least one cushion. That means the number of cushions \\( c \\) should be at least \\( \\frac{b}{4} \\). So,\n\n\\( c \\geq \\frac{b}{4} \\)\n\nOr, to avoid fractions, we can write it as:\n\n\\( 4c \\geq b \\)\n\nBut I think the first way is clearer, so I'll stick with \\( c \\geq \\frac{b}{4} \\).\n\nOur goal is to maximize the total number of items, which is \\( b + g + c \\). So, we need to maximize \\( b + g + c \\) subject to the constraints:\n\n1. \\( 20b + 40g + 60c \\leq 1200 \\)\n2. \\( b \\geq 2g \\)\n3. \\( c \\geq \\frac{b}{4} \\)\n\nSince we're dealing with integers (you can't have a fraction of a book or a cushion), we'll need to consider integer solutions. But maybe I can work with the inequalities first and then adjust for integer values.\n\nLet me try to express all variables in terms of one variable to reduce the number of variables. Let's start by expressing \\( b \\) in terms of \\( g \\) using the first requirement.\n\nFrom \\( b \\geq 2g \\), let's say \\( b = 2g + k \\), where \\( k \\) is a non-negative integer (since we can't have negative books). This way, \\( k \\) accounts for the extra books beyond twice the number of games.\n\nSimilarly, from the cushion requirement, \\( c \\geq \\frac{b}{4} \\). Let's express \\( c \\) in terms of \\( b \\). Let's say \\( c = \\frac{b}{4} + m \\), where \\( m \\) is a non-negative integer. This way, \\( m \\) accounts for the extra cushions beyond the required one per four books.\n\nBut maybe it's better to express \\( c \\) in terms of \\( b \\) directly. Let's substitute \\( c \\) from the cushion requirement into the total cost equation.\n\nSo, substituting \\( c \\geq \\frac{b}{4} \\), we can write \\( c = \\frac{b}{4} + m \\) as I did before. But perhaps it's better to use \\( c = \\frac{b}{4} + m \\) and substitute into the budget equation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express \\( c \\) in terms of \\( b \\) and then express \\( g \\) in terms of \\( b \\) as well.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nFrom \\( c \\geq \\frac{b}{4} \\), let's take \\( c = \\frac{b}{4} + m \\).\n\nSimilarly, from \\( b \\geq 2g \\), let's take \\( g = \\frac{b}{2} - n \\), where \\( n \\) is a non-negative integer. Wait, but \\( g \\) has to be an integer, so \\( \\frac{b}{2} \\) needs to be an integer or \\( b \\) must be even. Hmm, maybe that's complicating things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express \\( g \\) in terms of \\( b \\) as \\( g \\leq \\frac{b}{2} \\).\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to use substitution to reduce variables.\n\nLet me consider that the total cost is \\( 20b + 40g + 60c \\leq 1200 \\).\n\nI can divide the entire equation by 20 to simplify:\n\n\\( b + 2g + 3c \\leq 60 \\)\n\nThat's a bit cleaner.\n\nNow, our goal is to maximize \\( b + g + c \\).\n\nSo, we have:\n\nMaximize \\( b + g + c \\)\n\nSubject to:\n\n1. \\( b + 2g + 3c \\leq 60 \\)\n2. \\( b \\geq 2g \\)\n3. \\( c \\geq \\frac{b}{4} \\)\n\nAnd all variables are non-negative integers.\n\nHmm, that's a bit better.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. Maybe I can express \\( b \\) and \\( c \\) in terms of \\( g \\) or vice versa.\n\nFrom constraint 2: \\( b \\geq 2g \\). So, \\( b = 2g + k \\), where \\( k \\geq 0 \\).\n\nFrom constraint 3: \\( c \\geq \\frac{b}{4} \\). Substituting \\( b = 2g + k \\), we get \\( c \\geq \\frac{2g + k}{4} \\).\n\nBut since \\( c \\) must be an integer, we can write \\( c \\geq \\lceil \\frac{2g + k}{4} \\rceil \\). Hmm, that might get complicated with ceiling functions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express \\( c \\) in terms of \\( b \\) as \\( c = \\frac{b}{4} + m \\), where \\( m \\geq 0 \\).\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to express everything in terms of \\( b \\) and \\( g \\) and then find the relationship.\n\nWait, let's see. Since we have \\( b \\geq 2g \\) and \\( c \\geq \\frac{b}{4} \\), maybe I can find the minimum values of \\( c \\) in terms of \\( b \\) and then express \\( g \\) in terms of \\( b \\), substitute into the budget, and then maximize.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nFrom \\( c \\geq \\frac{b}{4} \\), the minimum \\( c \\) is \\( \\frac{b}{4} \\). But since \\( c \\) must be an integer, we'll take \\( c = \\lceil \\frac{b}{4} \\rceil \\). However, to avoid dealing with ceiling functions, maybe we can consider \\( c \\) as \\( \\frac{b + 3}{4} \\) to ensure it's an integer. Wait, that might not always work. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider \\( c \\) as \\( \\frac{b}{4} + m \\), where \\( m \\geq 0 \\).\n\nBut perhaps instead of dealing with \\( m \\), I can express \\( c \\) as \\( \\frac{b}{4} + m \\), and then substitute into the budget equation.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to express \\( g \\) in terms of \\( b \\) from the first constraint.\n\nFrom \\( b \\geq 2g \\), we can express \\( g \\leq \\frac{b}{2} \\).\n\nSo, \\( g \\) can be at most \\( \\lfloor \\frac{b}{2} \\rfloor \\) because \\( g \\) must be an integer.\n\nSimilarly, from \\( c \\geq \\frac{b}{4} \\), \\( c \\) must be at least \\( \\lceil \\frac{b}{4} \\rceil \\).\n\nBut perhaps instead of dealing with individual cases, I can find the relationship between \\( b \\), \\( g \\), and \\( c \\) in the budget equation.\n\nLet me try to express the budget equation in terms of \\( b \\) and \\( c \\), considering the constraints.\n\nFrom the budget equation after simplifying: \\( b + 2g + 3c \\leq 60 \\).\n\nFrom the constraints:\n\n1. \\( b \\geq 2g \\) \u2192 \\( g \\leq \\frac{b}{2} \\)\n2. \\( c \\geq \\frac{b}{4} \\)\n\nSo, substituting \\( g \\leq \\frac{b}{2} \\) into the budget equation:\n\n\\( b + 2*(\\frac{b}{2}) + 3c \\leq 60 \\)\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\( b + b + 3c \\leq 60 \\)\n\n\u2192 \\( 2b + 3c \\leq 60 \\)\n\nBut this is under the assumption that \\( g = \\frac{b}{2} \\). However, \\( g \\) must be an integer, so \\( \\frac{b}{2} \\) must be an integer, meaning \\( b \\) must be even. So, perhaps \\( b \\) is even, and \\( g = \\frac{b}{2} \\).\n\nWait, but if \\( b \\) is even, then \\( g = \\frac{b}{2} \\) is an integer. If \\( b \\) is odd, then \\( g \\) would be a fraction, which isn't allowed. So, to ensure \\( g \\) is an integer, \\( b \\) must be even, and \\( g = \\frac{b}{2} \\).\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider \\( b \\) as even for the maximum case, because if \\( b \\) is odd, \\( g \\) would have to be less than \\( \\frac{b}{2} \\), which might allow more flexibility in the budget.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to proceed with \\( b \\) as even for now and see where that leads.\n\nSo, assuming \\( b \\) is even, \\( g = \\frac{b}{2} \\).\n\nThen, the budget equation becomes:\n\n\\( 2b + 3c \\leq 60 \\)\n\nAnd from the cushion constraint, \\( c \\geq \\frac{b}{4} \\).\n\nSo, substituting \\( c \\geq \\frac{b}{4} \\) into the budget equation:\n\n\\( 2b + 3*(\\frac{b}{4}) \\leq 60 \\)\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\( 2b + \\frac{3b}{4} \\leq 60 \\)\n\n\u2192 \\( \\frac{8b}{4} + \\frac{3b}{4} = \\frac{11b}{4} \\leq 60 \\)\n\n\u2192 \\( 11b \\leq 240 \\)\n\n\u2192 \\( b \\leq \\frac{240}{11} \u2248 21.818 \\)\n\nSince \\( b \\) must be an integer and even, the maximum even \\( b \\) is 20.\n\nSo, \\( b = 20 \\)\n\nThen, \\( g = \\frac{20}{2} = 10 \\)\n\nAnd \\( c \\geq \\frac{20}{4} = 5 \\)\n\nNow, let's compute the total cost with \\( b=20 \\), \\( g=10 \\), \\( c=5 \\):\n\nCost = \\( 20*20 + 40*10 + 60*5 = 400 + 400 + 300 = 1100 \\)\n\nThat's within the budget of $1200.\n\nNow, the total number of items is \\( 20 + 10 + 5 = 35 \\).\n\nIs this the maximum? Let's check if we can get a higher total by considering \\( b \\) less than 20 but perhaps having more items.\n\nWait, but 20 is the maximum \\( b \\) under the constraints. Let me see if \\( b \\) can be higher if we don't assume \\( g = \\frac{b}{2} \\).\n\nWait, perhaps I was too quick to assume \\( g = \\frac{b}{2} \\). Let me reconsider.\n\nFrom the budget equation after substituting \\( c = \\frac{b}{4} \\):\n\n\\( 2b + 3c = 2b + 3*(b/4) = 2b + (3b/4) = (11b)/4 \\leq 60 \\)\n\nSo, \\( 11b \\leq 240 \\), \\( b \\leq 21.818 \\), so \\( b \\leq 21 \\).\n\nBut since \\( b \\) must be even for \\( g \\) to be integer, the maximum \\( b \\) is 20.\n\nBut perhaps if \\( b \\) is odd, \\( g \\) would be less, which might allow \\( c \\) to be less, freeing up more money for more items.\n\nLet me try \\( b = 21 \\). Then, \\( g \\leq \\frac{21}{2} = 10.5 \\), so \\( g = 10 \\).\n\nThen, \\( c \\geq \\frac{21}{4} = 5.25 \\), so \\( c = 6 \\).\n\nNow, let's compute the cost:\n\n\\( 20*21 + 40*10 + 60*6 = 420 + 400 + 360 = 1180 \\)\n\nThat's within budget.\n\nTotal items: 21 + 10 + 6 = 37.\n\nThat's more than the previous 35.\n\nSo, that's better.\n\nWait, but \\( b =21 \\) is odd, so \\( g =10 \\), which is acceptable because \\( b \\geq 2g \\) \u2192 21 \u2265 20, which is true.\n\nSo, that's a valid solution.\n\nNow, let's check if we can go higher.\n\nWhat if \\( b =22 \\)?\n\nThen, \\( g \\leq 11 \\).\n\n\\( c \\geq 22/4 = 5.5 \u2192 c=6 \\).\n\nCompute cost:\n\n20*22 +40*11 +60*6 = 440 +440 +360 = 1240.\n\nThat's over the budget.

    "solution": "Solve this problem step by step. End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: A small neighborhood library has received a donation of $1,200 to improve its children's section. The librarian needs to decide how to allocate this money among three options: new books ($20 each), educational games ($40 each), and comfortable seating cushions ($60 each). Based on feedback from patrons, the library should have at least twice as many books as games, and at least one cushion for every four books. What is the maximum number of total items (books, games, and cushions combined) that the library can purchase while staying within budget and meeting all requirements? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how the librarian can allocate the $1,200 donation among books, games, and cushions. The goal is to maximize the total number of items while meeting the requirements. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's define the variables:\n\n- Let \\( b \\) be the number of new books.\n- Let \\( g \\) be the number of educational games.\n- Let \\( c \\) be the number of comfortable seating cushions.\n\nThe cost constraints are:\n\n1. Each book costs $20, so the total cost for books is \\( 20b \\).\n2. Each game costs $40, so the total cost for games is \\( 40g \\).\n3. Each cushion costs $60, so the total cost for cushions is \\( 60c \\).\n\nThe total budget is $1,200, so the equation for the total cost is:\n\n\\[ 20b + 40g + 60c = 1200 \\]\n\nNow, let's consider the requirements:\n\n1. **At least twice as many books as games**: This translates to \\( b \\geq 2g \\).\n2. **At least one cushion for every four books**: This means \\( c \\geq \\frac{b}{4} \\).\n\nOur objective is to maximize the total number of items, which is \\( b + g + c \\).\n\nSo, we need to find non-negative integers \\( b, g, c \\) that satisfy both the budget and the requirements, and among all possible solutions, we need the one with the maximum \\( b + g + c \\).\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. Maybe I can express the variables in terms of each other using the constraints.\n\nFrom the first requirement, \\( b \\geq 2g \\), so I can express \\( b \\) as \\( b = 2g + k \\), where \\( k \\geq 0 \\) is an integer. This accounts for the fact that the number of books is at least twice the number of games.\n\nFrom the second requirement, \\( c \\geq \\frac{b}{4} \\). Substituting \\( b = 2g + k \\) into this, we get \\( c \\geq \\frac{2g + k}{4} \\). Since \\( c \\) has to be an integer, we can write \\( c \\geq \\lceil \\frac{2g + k}{4} \\rceil \\). But since \\( k \\) is non-negative, the minimum value of \\( c \\) is \\( \\lceil \\frac{2g}{4} \\rceil = \\lceil \\frac{g}{2} \\rceil \\).\n\nAlternatively, to simplify, let's express \\( c \\) in terms of \\( b \\). Since \\( c \\geq \\frac{b}{4} \\), let's write \\( c = \\frac{b}{4} + m \\), where \\( m \\geq 0 \\) is an integer. But \\( c \\) must also be an integer, so \\( b \\) must be a multiple of 4 if \\( m \\) is an integer. However, since \\( b \\) could be any number, \\( m \\) can be a non-integer, but since we're dealing with counts, \\( c \\) must be an integer. Therefore, \\( b \\) must be such that \\( \\frac{b}{4} \\) is either an integer or \\( c \\) can be rounded up.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to express everything in terms of \\( g \\) and then find possible values.\n\nLet me try to express \\( b \\) and \\( c \\) in terms of \\( g \\).\n\nFrom \\( b \\geq 2g \\), let's let \\( b = 2g + k \\), where \\( k \\geq 0 \\).\n\nFrom \\( c \\geq \\frac{b}{4} \\), substituting \\( b = 2g + k \\), we get \\( c \\geq \\frac{2g + k}{4} \\).\n\nSince \\( c \\) must be an integer, \\( c \\) must be at least the ceiling of \\( \\frac{2g + k}{4} \\).\n\nBut this might complicate things. Maybe I can consider possible values of \\( g \\) and then find corresponding \\( b \\) and \\( c \\).\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the budget equation:\n\n\\[ 20b + 40g + 60c = 1200 \\]\n\nWe can divide the entire equation by 20 to simplify:\n\n\\[ b + 2g + 3c = 60 \\]\n\nSo now we have:\n\n\\[ b + 2g + 3c = 60 \\]\n\nSubject to:\n\n1. \\( b \\geq 2g \\)\n2. \\( c \\geq \\frac{b}{4} \\)\n\nOur goal is to maximize \\( b + g + c \\).\n\nLet me denote \\( T = b + g + c \\), which we want to maximize.\n\nSince \\( b + 2g + 3c = 60 \\), we can express \\( T = (b + g + c) = (60 - 2g - 3c) + g + c = 60 - g - 2c \\).\n\nWait, that seems a bit off. Let me check:\n\nFrom \\( b + 2g + 3c = 60 \\), we can express \\( b = 60 - 2g - 3c \\).\n\nThen \\( T = b + g + c = (60 - 2g - 3c) + g + c = 60 - g - 2c \\).\n\nYes, that's correct. So \\( T = 60 - g - 2c \\).\n\nWait, that's interesting. So to maximize \\( T \\), which is \\( 60 - g - 2c \\), we need to minimize \\( g + 2c \\).\n\nBut we also have constraints:\n\n1. \\( b = 60 - 2g - 3c \\geq 2g \\)\n2. \\( c \\geq \\frac{b}{4} \\)\n\nLet me rewrite the first constraint:\n\n\\( 60 - 2g - 3c \\geq 2g \\)\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\( 60 - 3c \\geq 4g \\)\n\nWhich is:\n\n\\( 4g \\leq 60 - 3c \\)\n\nSimilarly, the second constraint:\n\n\\( c \\geq \\frac{b}{4} = \\frac{60 - 2g - 3c}{4} \\)\n\nMultiply both sides by 4:\n\n\\( 4c \\geq 60 - 2g - 3c \\)\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\( 4c + 3c + 2g \\geq 60 \\)\n\n\\( 7c + 2g \\geq 60 \\)\n\nSo now we have:\n\n1. \\( 4g + 3c \\leq 60 \\) (from the first constraint)\n2. \\( 7c + 2g \\geq 60 \\) (from the second constraint)\n3. \\( g, c \\geq 0 \\) integers\n\nAnd we need to minimize \\( g + 2c \\) to maximize \\( T = 60 - g - 2c \\).\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding integers \\( g, c \\) such that:\n\n- \\( 7c + 2g \\geq 60 \\)\n- \\( 4g + 3c \\leq 60 \\)\n- \\( g, c \\geq 0 \\)\n\nAnd then find the combination that gives the minimal \\( g + 2c \\).\n\nAlternatively, we can set up inequalities:\n\nFrom \\( 7c + 2g \\geq 60 \\) and \\( 4g + 3c \\leq 60 \\), we can try to find feasible \\( g, c \\) pairs.\n\nLet me try to express \\( g \\) from the first inequality:\n\nFrom \\( 7c + 2g \\geq 60 \\), we have \\( 2g \\geq 60 - 7c \\), so \\( g \\geq (60 - 7c)/2 \\).\n\nSimilarly, from \\( 4g + 3c \\leq 60 \\), we have \\( 4g \\leq 60 - 3c \\), so \\( g \\leq (60 - 3c)/4 \\).\n\nTherefore, combining these:\n\n\\( (60 - 7c)/2 \\leq g \\leq (60 - 3c)/4 \\)\n\nBut since \\( g \\) must be an integer, we can write:\n\n\\( \\lceil (60 - 7c)/2 \\rceil \\leq g \\leq \\lfloor (60 - 3c)/4 \\rfloor \\)\n\nAlso, since \\( g \\) and \\( c \\) are non-negative, we can consider possible values of \\( c \\) and find corresponding \\( g \\).\n\nLet me consider possible values of \\( c \\) starting from 0 upwards.\n\nBut first, let's see what the possible range of \\( c \\) is.\n\nFrom \\( 7c + 2g \\geq 60 \\) and \\( 4g + 3c \\leq 60 \\), we can find the maximum possible \\( c \\).\n\nFrom \\( 4g + 3c \\leq 60 \\), since \\( g \\geq 0 \\), the maximum \\( c \\) is when \\( g = 0 \\), so \\( 3c \\leq 60 \\) => \\( c \\leq 20 \\).\n\nSimilarly, from \\( 7c + 2g \\geq 60 \\), when \\( g = 0 \\), \\( 7c \\geq 60 \\) => \\( c \\geq 9 \\) (since 7*8=56 <60, 7*9=63\u226560).\n\nSo \\( c \\) is between 9 and 20.\n\nLet me start with \\( c = 9 \\):\n\nFor \\( c = 9 \\):\n\nFrom \\( 4g + 3*9 \\leq 60 \\) => \\( 4g +27 \u226460 \\) => \\( 4g \u226433 \\) => \\( g \u22648.25 \\).

End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: A small neighborhood library has received a donation of $1,200 to improve its children's section. The librarian needs to decide how to allocate this money among three options: new books ($20 each), educational games ($40 each), and comfortable seating cushions ($60 each). Based on feedback from patrons, the library should have at least twice as many books as games, and at least one cushion for every four books. What is the maximum number of total items (books, games, and cushions combined) that the library can purchase while staying within budget and meeting all requirements? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so the library has $1,200 to spend on three things: new books, educational games, and comfortable seating cushions. Each book costs $20, each game is $40, and each cushion is $60. They want to maximize the total number of items they can buy while meeting some specific conditions. \n\nFirst, let's list out the requirements:\n\n1. **At least twice as many books as games.** So, if I let the number of games be G, then the number of books B has to be at least 2G. So, B \u2265 2G.\n\n2. **At least one cushion for every four books.** That means for every four books, they need one cushion. So, the number of cushions C must be at least B/4. So, C \u2265 B/4.\n\nAlso, the total cost should not exceed $1,200. So, 20B + 40G + 60C \u2264 1200.\n\nOur goal is to maximize the total number of items, which is B + G + C.\n\nHmm, okay. So, we need to find integers B, G, C that satisfy these conditions and maximize B + G + C.\n\nSince we need to maximize the number of items, it makes sense to try to spend as much money as possible on items that give the most \"items per dollar.\" Let's see:\n\n- Books cost $20 each and give 1 item.\n- Games cost $40 each and give 1 item.\n- Cushions cost $60 each and give 1 item.\n\nSo, in terms of items per dollar, they're all the same. So, maybe the way to maximize items is to maximize the number of items without considering the constraints. But wait, we have constraints.\n\nWait, actually, each item gives 1 unit regardless of type. So, in that case, maybe the total number of items is just B + G + C. Since each item is 1 unit, maximizing the number of items is equivalent to maximizing B + G + C.\n\nBut, the constraints tie B and G together, and C to B. So, perhaps we can model this as a linear programming problem, but since we need integer solutions, it's integer linear programming.\n\nBut since it's a small problem, maybe we can approach it by testing different values.\n\nLet me think. Let's denote:\n\n- B = number of books\n- G = number of games\n- C = number of cushions\n\nGiven:\n\n1. B \u2265 2G\n2. C \u2265 B/4\n3. 20B + 40G + 60C \u2264 1200\n4. All variables are non-negative integers.\n\nWe need to maximize B + G + C.\n\nSince all items are 1 unit, to maximize the total, we need to maximize B + G + C, but within the budget and constraints.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. Maybe express variables in terms of each other.\n\nFrom the first constraint: B \u2265 2G. So, G can be at most B/2.\n\nFrom the second constraint: C \u2265 B/4. So, C can be at least B/4.\n\nSo, perhaps express G in terms of B and C in terms of B.\n\nLet me try to express G and C in terms of B.\n\nLet\u2019s denote G = k, then B \u2265 2k.\n\nSimilarly, C = m, then m \u2265 B/4.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to express G in terms of B and C in terms of B, then plug into the budget equation.\n\nLet\u2019s let G = floor(B/2), but since B and G must be integers, G can be at most floor(B/2). Similarly, C must be at least ceil(B/4), because if B is not divisible by 4, C needs to be the next integer.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to express G as B/2 and C as B/4, but since they have to be integers, we can work with that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express everything in terms of B.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that G is as large as possible, given B. Since B \u2265 2G, G can be at most floor(B/2).\n\nSimilarly, C must be at least ceil(B/4).\n\nBut maybe it's better to express G in terms of B and C in terms of B, then plug into the budget.\n\nWait, let's think differently. Let's express the total cost:\n\n20B + 40G + 60C \u2264 1200.\n\nWe can write this as:\n\n20B + 40G + 60C \u2264 1200.\n\nWe can divide both sides by 20 to simplify:\n\nB + 2G + 3C \u2264 60.\n\nSo, B + 2G + 3C \u2264 60.\n\nOur objective is to maximize B + G + C.\n\nSo, we have:\n\nMaximize B + G + C\n\nSubject to:\n\nB + 2G + 3C \u2264 60\n\nB \u2265 2G\n\nC \u2265 B/4\n\nB, G, C \u2265 0 integers.\n\nHmm, okay, so now we have a linear programming problem with integer variables.\n\nSince the numbers are small, maybe we can try to find the maximum possible B + G + C.\n\nLet\u2019s denote T = B + G + C.\n\nWe need to maximize T.\n\nGiven that B + 2G + 3C \u2264 60.\n\nBut since B \u2265 2G and C \u2265 B/4, we can substitute these into the budget.\n\nLet\u2019s try substituting B \u2265 2G into the budget.\n\nSo, B + 2G + 3C \u2264 60.\n\nBut since B \u2265 2G, we can replace B with 2G in the budget equation to see the minimum possible budget.\n\nWait, that might not be the right approach. Alternatively, since B \u2265 2G, let's express B as 2G + x, where x is a non-negative integer (since B must be at least 2G, x can be 0,1,2,...).\n\nSimilarly, C must be at least B/4, so C = (B)/4 + y, where y is a non-negative integer.\n\nBut this might complicate things. Alternatively, let's think about the minimal C given B.\n\nGiven C \u2265 B/4, so the minimal C is ceil(B/4). Similarly, G can be up to floor(B/2).\n\nBut perhaps it's better to express everything in terms of B.\n\nLet\u2019s let B be as large as possible, then see how much we can buy G and C.\n\nBut the budget is limited, so we need to balance.\n\nLet me try to think about possible values of B.\n\nSince C \u2265 B/4, and C costs $60 each, which is more expensive than books and games, but we need to see how much we can allocate.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to consider that since C is more expensive, buying more C would limit the number of B and G.\n\nBut since our goal is to maximize the total items, which is B + G + C, we might need to find a balance between buying more B and G, which are cheaper, and buying enough C.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can express the budget in terms of C.\n\nFrom C \u2265 B/4, so B \u2264 4C.\n\nSimilarly, from B \u2265 2G, so G \u2264 B/2 \u2264 2C.\n\nSo, G \u2264 2C.\n\nSimilarly, the budget equation is:\n\n20B + 40G + 60C \u2264 1200.\n\nDivide by 20:\n\nB + 2G + 3C \u2264 60.\n\nSo, B + 2G + 3C \u2264 60.\n\nGiven that B \u2264 4C and G \u2264 2C.\n\nSo, substituting B \u2264 4C and G \u2264 2C into the budget equation:\n\n4C + 2*(2C) + 3C \u2264 60\n\n4C + 4C + 3C \u2264 60\n\n11C \u2264 60\n\nC \u2264 5 (since 11*5=55 \u226460, 11*6=66>60)\n\nSo, C can be at most 5.\n\nSimilarly, let's check:\n\nIf C=5,\n\nThen B \u22644*5=20.\n\nG \u22642*5=10.\n\nBut also, B must be at least 2G.\n\nSo, B \u22652G.\n\nSo, for C=5, B can be up to 20, G up to 10, but B must be \u22652G.\n\nSo, let's see:\n\nIf G=10, then B must be at least 20.\n\nBut B can be at most 20.\n\nSo, B=20, G=10, C=5.\n\nCheck the budget:\n\n20*20 + 40*10 + 60*5 = 400 + 400 + 300 = 1100 \u22641200.\n\nSo, that's within budget.\n\nTotal items:20+10+5=35.\n\nBut maybe we can get more items by reducing C.\n\nWait, because if we reduce C, we can potentially buy more B and G, which may give more total items.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nIf C=4,\n\nThen B \u226416, G \u22648.\n\nBut B must be \u22652G.\n\nSo, if G=8, then B must be at least 16.\n\nSo, B=16, G=8, C=4.\n\nCheck budget:\n\n20*16 +40*8 +60*4=320+320+240=880\u22641200.\n\nTotal items:16+8+4=28 <35.\n\nSo, less.\n\nIf C=6,\n\nBut earlier we saw C\u22645 because 11C\u226460, so C=5 is max.\n\nWait, 11C=55, so C=5.\n\nSo, C cannot be 6 because 11*6=66>60.\n\nSo, C=5 is the maximum.\n\nSimilarly, let's try C=5, and see if we can get more items.\n\nIs there a way to have more items with C=5?\n\nIf B=20, G=10, C=5, total=35.\n\nIs there a way to have more than 35?\n\nMaybe by having more G and B, but we have to stay within the budget.\n\nWait, let's see.\n\nIf we have C=5, and B=20, G=10, total=35.\n\nWhat if we reduce C to 4, then we can have more B and G.\n\nWait, but when C=4, B=16, G=8, total=28, which is less.\n\nAlternatively, maybe C=5, but have more G.\n\nWait, but G is limited by B.\n\nBecause B must be at least 2G.\n\nSo, if G=10, B=20.\n\nIf G=11, then B must be at least 22.\n\nBut B can be at most 20 because C=5, B=20.\n\nWait, no, because B can be up to 4C=20.\n\nSo, if G=11, then B must be at least 22, but B cannot exceed 20, which is a conflict.\n\nTherefore, G cannot be more than 10 when C=5.\n\nSo, G=10, B=20, C=5 is the maximum for C=5.\n\nAlternatively, maybe if we reduce C to 4, but then we can have B=16, G=8, C=4, total=28.\n\nBut that's less.\n\nAlternatively, maybe have C=5, but have more B and G by adjusting.\n\nWait, but B is already at maximum 20, G at maximum 10.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps have C=5, B=20, G=10, total=35.\n\nIs there a way to have more items?\n\nWait, let's think differently.\n\nWhat if we have C=5, and then see if we can have more G and B.\n\nBut B is limited by C.\n\nWait, no, B is limited by C as B \u22644C=20.\n\nSo, B cannot exceed 20.\n\nSimilarly, G is limited by B as G \u2264B/2=10.\n\nSo, G cannot exceed 10.\n\nTherefore, with C=5, the maximum B and G is 20 and 10, giving total=35.\n\nIs there a way to have more than 35?\n\nLet me think.\n\nSuppose we have C=5, B=20, G=10, total=35.\n\nWhat if we reduce C to 4, then we can have more B and G.\n\nWait, but when C=4, B=16, G=8, total=28.\n\nBut 28<35.\n\nAlternatively, what if we have C=5, but have more G by reducing B.\n\nWait, but B must be at least 2G.\n\nSo, if we have G=10, B=20.\n\nIf we have G=11, B=22, but B cannot exceed 20 because C=5, B=4*5=20.\n\nSo, that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps reduce C to 5, but have B=20, G=10, which is the maximum.\n\nAlternatively, maybe have C=5, B=20, G=10, total=35.\n\nIs that the maximum?\n\nWait, let's see if we can have more items by reducing C to 4, but then B=16, G=8, which is less.\n\nAlternatively, maybe have C=5, but have B=20, G=10, which is 35.\n\nAlternatively, think about having C=5, B=20, G=10, total=35.\n\nIs there a way to have more than 35?\n\nWait, let's try to have C=5, B=20, G=10, total=35.\n\nWhat if we have C=5, B=20, G=10, total=35.\n\nIs there a way to have more than 35?\n\nWait, let's check if we can have C=5, B=20, G=10, total=35.\n\nYes, that's the maximum.\n\nAlternatively, let's see if we can have more by having C=5, but more G.\n\nBut as above, G cannot exceed 10 because B must be at least 20.\n\nAlternatively, maybe have C=5, B=20, G=10, total=35.\n\nAlternatively, let's see if we can have C=5, B=20, G=10, total=35.\n\nYes, that seems to be the maximum.\n\nWait, but let's check if we can have more items by having less C but more G and B.\n\nWait, for example, if C=4, then B=16, G=8, total=28.\n\nBut that's less.\n\nAlternatively, if C=5, B=20, G=10, total=35.\n\nAlternatively, maybe have C=5, B=20, G=10, total=35.\n\nWait, is there a way to have more than 35?\n\nWait, let's think differently.\n\nLet me try to express everything in terms of C.\n\nFrom C \u2265 B/4, so B \u22644C.\n\nFrom B \u22652G, so G \u2264B/2 \u22642C.\n\nSo, G \u22642C.\n\nSo, the total budget is:\n\nB + 2G + 3C \u226460.\n\nBut since B \u22644C and G \u22642C,\n\nThen substituting:\n\n4C + 2*(2C) +3C \u226460\n\n4C +4C +3C \u226460\n\n11C \u226460\n\nC \u22645 (since 11*5=55 \u226460, 11*6=66>60)\n\nSo, C=5 is the maximum.\n\nSo, with C=5,\n\nB \u226420,\n\nG \u226410,\n\nBut also, B \u22652G.\n\nSo, G can be at most 10, which requires B=20.\n\nSo, B=20, G=10, C=5.\n\nTotal items=35.\n\nIs this the maximum?\n\nAlternatively, let's see if we can have C=5, B=20, G=10, total=35.\n\nYes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can have more items by having more G and B, but that would

End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: A small neighborhood library has received a donation of $1,200 to improve its children's section. The librarian needs to decide how to allocate this money among three options: new books ($20 each), educational games ($40 each), and comfortable seating cushions ($60 each). Based on feedback from patrons, the library should have at least twice as many books as games, and at least one cushion for every four books. What is the maximum number of total items (books, games, and cushions combined) that the library can purchase while staying within budget and meeting all requirements? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this problem about a library that received $1200 to improve its children's section. They need to decide how to allocate this money among three options: new books at $20 each, educational games at $40 each, and comfortable seating cushions at $60 each. The constraints are that they need at least twice as many books as games and at least one cushion for every four books. The goal is to find the maximum number of total items they can purchase while staying within the budget and meeting all these requirements.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the problem. Let's define variables for each item:\n\n- Let B = number of books\n- Let G = number of games\n- Let C = number of cushions\n\nNow, the total budget is $1200, so the cost equation would be:\n\n20B + 40G + 60C = 1200\n\nNext, the constraints. The first constraint is that the number of books must be at least twice the number of games:\n\nB \u2265 2G\n\nThe second constraint is that there must be at least one cushion for every four books, which translates to:\n\nC \u2265 (1/4)B\n\nSince the number of cushions can't be a fraction, we might need to consider the ceiling of B/4, but I think it's better to express it as C \u2265 (B/4), which implies that C must be at least B/4. However, since B and C must be integers, C should be at least the ceiling of B/4. But to keep it simple, I'll use C \u2265 (B/4) for now, keeping in mind that C must be an integer.\n\nThe goal is to maximize the total number of items, which is:\n\nTotal = B + G + C\n\nSo, I need to maximize B + G + C, given the budget constraint and the constraints on B and C.\n\nSince this is a linear programming problem with integer constraints, I can approach it by trying to express one variable in terms of the others and then optimizing.\n\nLet me try to express G in terms of B using the first constraint:\n\nFrom B \u2265 2G, we can write G \u2264 B/2\n\nSimilarly, from C \u2265 B/4, we can write C \u2265 B/4\n\nNow, the total cost is 20B + 40G + 60C = 1200\n\nSince we want to maximize B + G + C, it's beneficial to buy as many books as possible because they are the cheapest per item. However, we also need to satisfy the constraints on G and C.\n\nLet me try to express G in terms of B and C, or vice versa.\n\nAlternatively, I can use substitution. Let's express G as G = (B - x), where x is some number less than or equal to B, but considering the budget constraint.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to express G in terms of B from the first constraint. Since G \u2264 B/2, the maximum number of games we can buy is B/2. Similarly, the minimum number of cushions is B/4.\n\nLet me try to express the budget in terms of B.\n\nSo, substituting G \u2264 B/2 and C \u2265 B/4 into the budget equation.\n\nBut since we want to maximize the total items, we should try to spend as much as possible on books, then games, and then cushions, but considering that each item has a different cost.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to express everything in terms of B.\n\nLet me assume that G is as large as possible given B, and C is as small as possible given B.\n\nWait, no, because maximizing G would mean more games, but since books are cheaper per item, maybe it's better to maximize B first.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express the budget in terms of B, G, and C, and then try to find the values that satisfy the constraints.\n\nLet me try to express G and C in terms of B.\n\nFrom the budget equation:\n\n20B + 40G + 60C = 1200\n\nDivide everything by 20 to simplify:\n\nB + 2G + 3C = 60\n\nSo, B + 2G + 3C = 60\n\nNow, we have:\n\nB \u2265 2G \u2192 G \u2264 B/2\n\nC \u2265 B/4 \u2192 C \u2265 B/4\n\nOur goal is to maximize B + G + C\n\nLet me try to express G and C in terms of B.\n\nFrom G \u2264 B/2 and C \u2265 B/4, let's plug these into the equation B + 2G + 3C = 60\n\nLet me assume that G = B/2 (the maximum allowed by the constraint) and C = B/4 (the minimum required by the constraint). Let's see if this gives a feasible solution.\n\nSubstituting G = B/2 and C = B/4 into the equation:\n\nB + 2*(B/2) + 3*(B/4) = 60\n\nSimplify:\n\nB + B + (3B/4) = 60\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(1B + 1B + 0.75B) = 60\n\n2.75B = 60\n\nSo, B = 60 / 2.75 \u2248 21.818\n\nBut B must be an integer, so B = 21.818, which is not possible. Therefore, we need to consider B as 22, but let's check if that works.\n\nWait, actually, 2.75B = 60 \u2192 B = 60 / (11/4) = 60 * (4/11) \u2248 21.818\n\nSo, B must be at least 22 because it's not possible to have 21.818 books.\n\nBut let's check if B=22 works.\n\nIf B=22, then G = 22/2 = 11, and C = 22/4 = 5.5, but since C must be an integer, C=6.\n\nNow, let's plug these into the budget equation:\n\nB + 2G + 3C = 22 + 2*11 + 3*6 = 22 + 22 + 18 = 62\n\nBut the total should be 60, so this is over by 2. Therefore, we need to adjust.\n\nPerhaps, we can reduce the number of cushions by 1, making C=5, but then we need to check if the constraints are still satisfied.\n\nIf B=22, G=11, C=5, then:\n\nCheck if C \u2265 B/4: 5 \u2265 22/4=5.5 \u2192 5 \u22655.5? No, it's not. So, C must be at least 6.\n\nTherefore, B=22, G=11, C=6 gives a total of 62, which is over the budget. So, we need to reduce the budget by 2.\n\nPerhaps, reduce the number of games by 1. So, G=10, then:\n\nB + 2G + 3C = 22 + 20 + 18 = 60\n\nYes, that works.\n\nSo, B=22, G=10, C=6.\n\nNow, check the constraints:\n\n- B \u2265 2G: 22 \u2265 20 \u2192 Yes\n- C \u2265 B/4: 6 \u2265 5.5 \u2192 Yes\n\nTotal items: 22 + 10 + 6 = 38\n\nWait, but let me see if we can get a higher total by adjusting B.\n\nAlternatively, maybe B=21.\n\nIf B=21, then G=10.5, but G must be integer, so G=10.\n\nC=21/4=5.25, so C=6.\n\nThen, B + 2G + 3C =21 +20 +18=59, which is under the budget by 1.\n\nSo, we have $1 left. How can we use that?\n\nWe can increase either G or C.\n\nIf we increase G by 1, making G=11, then:\n\nB + 2G + 3C =21 +22 +18=61, which is over by 1.\n\nAlternatively, increase C by 1, making C=7:\n\n21 +20 +21=62, over by 2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps increase G by 1 and decrease C by 1:\n\nG=11, C=5.\n\nThen, total is 21 +22 +15=58, which is under by 2.\n\nNot helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe B=21, G=10, C=6, which gives total=59, and we have $1 left. Maybe we can buy an extra game with that $1, but each game is $40, so we can't.\n\nAlternatively, maybe B=21, G=10, C=6, and use the remaining $1 to buy something, but since we can't, perhaps this is not better than the previous solution.\n\nSo, the previous solution with B=22, G=10, C=6 gives total items=38, but it's over the budget by $2.\n\nWait, but we can't have that. So, perhaps B=21, G=10, C=6 gives total items=37, which is less than 38.\n\nAlternatively, maybe B=21, G=10, C=6, and use the remaining $1 to buy something, but we can't.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach. Let me try to find other combinations.\n\nLet me try B=24.\n\nIf B=24, G=12, C=6.\n\nThen, B + 2G + 3C=24 +24 +18=66, which is way over the budget.\n\nSo, that's not good.\n\nAlternatively, B=18.\n\nThen, G=9, C=4.5, so C=5.\n\nTotal:18 +18 +15=51.\n\nBut that's way lower than 38.\n\nAlternatively, B=20.\n\nG=10, C=5.\n\nTotal:20 +20 +15=55.\n\nStill lower.\n\nWait, maybe I should try to see if B=22, G=10, C=6 is the best.\n\nAlternatively, let's try B=22, G=10, C=6, which gives total=38, but it's over the budget by $2. So, we need to reduce the total by $2.\n\nPerhaps, reduce C by 1, making C=5, but then C=5 < B/4=5.5, which is not allowed.\n\nSo, C must be at least 6.\n\nTherefore, we can't reduce C further. So, perhaps reduce G by 1, making G=9.\n\nThen, B=22, G=9, C=6.\n\nTotal cost:22 +18 +18=58.\n\nWhich is under the budget by $2.\n\nTotal items:22+9+6=37.\n\nThat's worse than the previous 38.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps reduce G by 2, making G=8.\n\nThen, total cost:22 +16 +18=56.\n\nUnder by $4.\n\nTotal items:22+8+6=36.\n\nNot better.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps reduce B by 1, making B=21.\n\nThen, G=10, C=6.\n\nTotal cost:21 +20 +18=59.\n\nUnder by $1.\n\nTotal items:21+10+6=37.\n\nSame as before.\n\nAlternatively, maybe B=22, G=10, C=6, and accept that it's over by $2, but the problem says to stay within budget, so we can't do that.\n\nTherefore, the best we can do is B=21, G=10, C=6, which gives total items=37, but let's check if there's a better combination.\n\nWait, maybe B=20, G=10, C=5.\n\nTotal cost:20 +20 +15=55.\n\nTotal items=45.\n\nBut that's lower than 37.\n\nAlternatively, B=19, G=9, C=5.\n\nTotal cost:19 +18 +15=52.\n\nTotal items=43.\n\nStill lower.\n\nAlternatively, B=24, G=12, C=6.\n\nTotal cost=24 +24 +18=66.\n\nOver by $6.\n\nAlternatively, B=23.\n\nG=11, C=6.\n\nTotal cost=23 +22 +18=63.\n\nOver by $3.\n\nTotal items=23+11+6=40.\n\nStill, we have to stay within budget.\n\nAlternatively, B=23, G=11, C=6, but over by $3.\n\nSo, perhaps reduce C by 1, making C=5.\n\nThen, total cost=23 +22 +15=60.\n\nWhich is exactly the budget.\n\nCheck constraints:\n\nB=23 \u22652*11=22 \u2192 Yes.\n\nC=5 \u226523/4=5.75? No, 5 <5.75.\n\nSo, not allowed.\n\nTherefore, C must be at least 6.\n\nSo, we can't do that.\n\nAlternatively, reduce G by 1, making G=10.\n\nThen, total cost=23 +20 +18=61.\n\nOver by $1.\n\nBut we need to stay within budget, so that's not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, reduce B by 1, making B=22, G=11, C=6.\n\nTotal cost=22 +22 +18=62.\n\nOver by $2.\n\nSame as before.\n\nSo, seems like the best possible within budget is B=21, G=10, C=6, giving total items=37.\n\nBut wait, earlier when B=22, G=10, C=6, total items=38, but it's over by $2.\n\nIs there a way to reduce the overage by $2?\n\nPerhaps, reduce the number of games by 2, making G=8.\n\nThen, total cost=22 +16 +18=56.\n\nUnder by $4.\n\nTotal items=22+8+6=36.\n\nNot better.\n\nAlternatively, reduce G by 1, making G=9.\n\nTotal cost=22 +18 +18=58.\n\nUnder by $2.\n\nTotal items=37.\n\nSame as B=21, G=10, C=6.\n\nSo, both give 37 items.\n\nAlternatively, maybe B=21, G=10, C=6, which gives total items=37.\n\nBut earlier when B=22, G=10, C=6, we have 38 items but over by $2.\n\nSo, perhaps the maximum number of items is 37.\n\nBut let me check if there's another combination.\n\nSuppose B=20, G=10, C=5.\n\nTotal cost=20 +20 +15=55.\n\nUnder by $45.\n\nTotal items=45.\n\nBut that's lower than 37.\n\nAlternatively, B=19, G=9, C=5.\n\nTotal cost=19 +18 +15=52.\n\nUnder by $48.\n\nTotal items=43.\n\nStill lower.\n\nAlternatively, B=18, G=9, C=5.\n\nTotal cost=18 +18 +15=51.\n\nUnder by $49.\n\nTotal items=42.\n\nLower.\n\nAlternatively, B=17, G=8, C=5.\n\nTotal cost=17 +16 +15=48.\n\nUnder by $52.\n\nTotal items=40.\n\nStill lower.\n\nSo, seems like 37 is the maximum number of items within budget.\n\nWait, but earlier when B=22, G=10, C=6, total items=38, but over by $2.\n\nIs there a way to adjust to make it fit within budget?\n\nPerhaps, instead of buying 6 cushions, buy 5, but that would make C=5 < B/4=5.5, which is not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, buy 6 cushions, but reduce G by 2 to make the total cost=22 +16 +18=56.\n\nUnder by $4.\n\nBut total items=36, which is less than 37.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps buy 6 cushions and reduce G by 1, making G=9.\n\nTotal cost=22 +18 +18=58.\n\nUnder by $2.\n\nTotal items=37.\n\nSame as before.\n\nSo, the maximum number of items is 37.\n\nWait, but let me check another approach.\n\nLet me consider that the budget equation is B + 2G + 3C =60.\n\nWe need to maximize B + G + C.\n\nLet me denote T = B + G + C.\n\nOur goal is to maximize T.\n\nFrom the budget equation, B =60 -2G -3C.\n\nSubstitute into T:\n\nT = (60 -2G -3C) + G + C =60 -G -2C\n\nSo, T=60 -G -2C\n\nTo maximize T, we need to minimize G + 2C.\n\nBut we have constraints:\n\nB \u22652G \u2192 60 -2G -3C \u22652G \u219260 -3C \u22654G \u2192 G \u2264 (60 -3C)/4\n\nAnd C \u2265 B/4 \u2192 C \u2265 (60 -2G -3C)/4 \u2192 4C \u226560 -2G -3C \u21927C +2G \u226560\n\nSo, we have:\n\nG \u2264 (60 -3C)/4\n\nand\n\n7C +2G \u226560\n\nWe need to minimize G + 2C, subject to these constraints.\n\nThis seems a bit complicated, but perhaps we can find integer values of C that satisfy 7C +2G \u226560 and G \u2264 (60 -3C)/4.\n\nLet me try to find possible C values.\n\nSince C must be at least B/4, and B=60 -2G -3C.\n\nBut this might not be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, let's try to find C such that 7C +2G \u226560 and G \u2264 (60 -3C)/4.\n\nLet me express G in terms of C.\n\nFrom G \u2264 (60 -3C)/4\n\nAnd from 7C +2G \u226560 \u21922G \u226560 -7C \u2192 G \u2265 (60 -7C)/2\n\nSo, we have:\n\n(60 -7C)/2 \u2264 G \u2264 (60 -3C)/4\n\nWe need to find C such that (60 -7C)/2 \u2264 (60 -3C)/4\n\nMultiply both sides by 4:\n\n2*(60 -7C) \u226460 -3C\n\n120 -14C \u226460 -3C\n\n120 -60 \u226414C -3C\n\n60 \u226411C \u2192 C \u226560/11\u22485.454, so C\u22656\n\nSo, C must be at least 6.\n\nNow, let's try C=6.\n\nThen, G must satisfy:\n\n(60 -42)/2=9 \u2264 G \u2264(60 -18)/4=14.5\n\nSo, G can be from 9 to14 (since G must be integer).\n\nNow, for each G from 9 to14, compute T=60 -G -12=48 -G\n\nTo maximize T, minimize G.\n\nSo, G=9 \u2192 T=48-9=39\n\nBut let's check if this satisfies all constraints.\n\nB=60 -2*9 -3*6=60-18-18=24\n\nCheck B \u22652G:24 \u226518 \u2192Yes\n\nCheck C=6 \u226524/4=6 \u2192Yes\n\nSo"

What is the maximum number of total items (books, games, and cushions combined) that the library can purchase while staying within budget and meeting all requirements? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem where a small library received $1,200 to improve their children's section. They need to decide how to allocate this money among three options: new books at $20 each, educational games at $40 each, and comfortable seating cushions at $60 each. \n\nThe requirements are that they must have at least twice as many books as games, and at least one cushion for every four books. The goal is to find the maximum number of total items (books, games, and cushions combined) that the library can purchase while staying within the budget and meeting all these requirements.\n\nAlright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's define some variables to represent the quantities we're dealing with. Let's say:\n\n- Let B = number of books\n- Let G = number of games\n- Let C = number of cushions\n\nNow, the constraints given are:\n\n1. At least twice as many books as games: So, B \u2265 2G\n2. At least one cushion for every four books: So, C \u2265 (1/4)B. But since the number of cushions has to be a whole number, we might need to adjust this later.\n\nOur total budget is $1,200, so the cost of all items must not exceed this. The cost for each item is given:\n\n- Books: $20 each, so total cost for books is 20B\n- Games: $40 each, so total cost for games is 40G\n- Cushions: $60 each, so total cost for cushions is 60C\n\nSo, the total cost equation is:\n\n20B + 40G + 60C \u2264 1200\n\nWe need to maximize the total number of items, which is B + G + C.\n\nSo, our objective is to maximize B + G + C, subject to:\n\n1. B \u2265 2G\n2. C \u2265 (1/4)B\n3. 20B + 40G + 60C \u2264 1200\n\nSince all variables must be integers, we'll have to consider integer solutions.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. One way is to express B and C in terms of G, or find a substitution that can reduce the number of variables.\n\nStarting with the first constraint: B \u2265 2G. So, B must be at least twice the number of games. That means for every game, we need at least two books.\n\nThe second constraint: C \u2265 (1/4)B. So, for every four books, we need at least one cushion. This means C must be at least B/4, but since C has to be an integer, if B is not a multiple of 4, we might need to round up.\n\nNow, let's try to express C in terms of B: C \u2265 (1/4)B. So, the minimum C can be is ceil(B/4), where ceil is the ceiling function, which rounds up to the nearest integer.\n\nSimilarly, from B \u2265 2G, we can express G in terms of B: G \u2264 B/2. So, the maximum number of games we can have is half the number of books.\n\nOur total cost is 20B + 40G + 60C \u2264 1200.\n\nWe need to find integer values of B, G, C that satisfy all these conditions and maximize B + G + C.\n\nSince we're dealing with integers, maybe it's best to express everything in terms of B and find possible G and C for each B.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to express G and C in terms of B and substitute into the budget constraint.\n\nLet me try expressing G and C in terms of B.\n\nFrom B \u2265 2G, let's say G is as large as possible, which would be G = floor(B/2). But since G has to be an integer, G can be up to B/2.\n\nSimilarly, from C \u2265 B/4, the minimum C is ceil(B/4).\n\nBut since we want to maximize the total number of items, which is B + G + C, we need to find the combination where G is as large as possible and C is as small as possible, given B.\n\nWait, but actually, both G and C affect the total cost. So, if we increase G, we have to decrease C or B, which might not be straightforward.\n\nPerhaps a better approach is to express G and C in terms of B and then substitute into the budget constraint.\n\nLet me define G in terms of B: Since B \u2265 2G, let's say G = k, then B \u2265 2k.\n\nSimilarly, C \u2265 B/4. Let's say C = m, where m \u2265 B/4.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to express G and C in terms of B with the minimum required to meet the constraints, and then see how much money is left for additional items.\n\nWait, let's think about it differently.\n\nWe need to allocate the money to maximize B + G + C.\n\nGiven that 20B + 40G + 60C = 1200, but we can spend up to 1200.\n\nBut to maximize the number of items, we want to spend as much as possible on the cheapest items, which are books at $20 each, followed by games at $40, and then cushions at $60.\n\nSo, ideally, to maximize the number of items, we should buy as many books as possible, then games, and then cushions.\n\nBut we have constraints: B \u2265 2G and C \u2265 B/4.\n\nSo, perhaps the optimal strategy is to buy the minimum required cushions for the books, and then allocate the remaining money to buy as many books and games as possible, while satisfying B \u2265 2G.\n\nLet me try to formalize this.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\nC = ceil(B/4). But since we want to minimize C to maximize the number of items, we can set C = floor(B/4) if B is divisible by 4, otherwise C = ceil(B/4). But to keep it simple, let's express C as C = (B + 3)/4, which ensures that C is at least B/4, rounded up.\n\nWait, but that might not always be an integer. Alternatively, since B must be a multiple of 4 for C to be exactly B/4, otherwise, C needs to be one more than B/4.\n\nBut perhaps instead of getting bogged down in the ceiling function, I can express C as C = (B + 3) // 4, which is the integer division rounding up.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to express C as C = B/4, and then adjust for any fractional part.\n\nAlternatively, let's express C as C = (B + 3) // 4.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nLet\u2019s suppose B is a multiple of 4, say B = 4k. Then C = k.\n\nIf B is not a multiple of 4, say B = 4k + r, where r = 1,2,3, then C = k + 1.\n\nSo, in general, C = ceil(B/4).\n\nSimilarly, G must be \u2264 B/2.\n\nSo, let's try to express the budget constraint in terms of B.\n\nWe have:\n\n20B + 40G + 60C \u2264 1200\n\nBut we need to express G and C in terms of B.\n\nGiven that G \u2264 B/2 and C \u2265 B/4.\n\nTo maximize the total items, we should minimize C and maximize G as much as possible.\n\nWait, but G is bounded by B/2, so for a given B, G can be up to floor(B/2).\n\nSimilarly, C is at least ceil(B/4).\n\nSo, for a given B, the minimal C is ceil(B/4), and the maximal G is floor(B/2).\n\nTherefore, for each B, the minimal cost would be 20B + 40*floor(B/2) + 60*ceil(B/4).\n\nBut we need to ensure that 20B + 40*floor(B/2) + 60*ceil(B/4) \u2264 1200.\n\nWait, no. Actually, the minimal cost for C is 60*ceil(B/4), and for G, the maximum is 40*floor(B/2). So, the minimal cost for a given B is 20B + 40*floor(B/2) + 60*ceil(B/4). But we need this to be \u22641200.\n\nBut actually, we can spend up to 1200, so for each B, we can compute the minimal cost, and then see how much money is left to allocate to more items.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of it as:\n\nFor a given B, the minimal cost is when we buy the minimum required C and maximum possible G.\n\nSo, let's compute for each B, the minimal cost, and see if it's within the budget.\n\nBut B can't be too large, otherwise the minimal cost would exceed 1200.\n\nSo, let's find the maximum possible B such that 20B + 40*floor(B/2) + 60*ceil(B/4) \u22641200.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to set up equations.\n\nLet\u2019s define:\n\nC = ceil(B/4)\n\nG = floor(B/2)\n\nThen, the total cost is 20B + 40G + 60C.\n\nWe need 20B + 40G + 60C \u22641200.\n\nWe can express G as floor(B/2) = (B - (B mod 2))/2.\n\nSimilarly, C = ceil(B/4) = (B + 3 - (B mod 4))/4.\n\nThis might complicate things, but perhaps we can consider B in terms of mod 4 and mod 2.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider B as varying and compute for each possible B whether the minimal cost is within the budget.\n\nBut since B can't be too large, let's estimate.\n\nThe maximum B would be such that 20B \u22641200, so B \u226460.\n\nBut considering the other costs, it's likely less.\n\nLet\u2019s try to find B such that 20B + 40*(B/2) +60*(B/4) \u22641200.\n\nWait, but G is floor(B/2), so if B is even, G = B/2. If B is odd, G = (B-1)/2.\n\nSimilarly, C is ceil(B/4), so if B is divisible by 4, C = B/4. Otherwise, C = (B//4) +1.\n\nSo, let's consider B as a multiple of 4, say B=4k.\n\nThen, C= k, G= 2k.\n\nTotal cost: 20*(4k) +40*(2k) +60*k =80k +80k +60k=220k.\n\nWe need 220k \u22641200 \u2192 k \u22645.45, so k=5.\n\nThus, B=20, C=5, G=10.\n\nTotal items:20+10+5=35.\n\nBut wait, let's check if this is the maximum.\n\nAlternatively, if B is not a multiple of 4.\n\nLet\u2019s say B=4k +1.\n\nThen, C= k +1, G=2k.\n\nTotal cost:20*(4k+1) +40*(2k) +60*(k+1)=80k +20 +80k +60k +60= (80k +80k +60k) +20 +60=220k +80.\n\nWe need 220k +80 \u22641200 \u2192220k \u22641120 \u2192k \u22645.09, so k=5.\n\nThus, B=21, C=6, G=10.\n\nTotal items:21+10+6=37.\n\nThat's better.\n\nSimilarly, if B=4k+2.\n\nThen, C= k +1 (since 4k+2 divided by 4 is k.5, so ceil(k.5)=k+1).\n\nG=2k+1 (since B=4k+2, floor((4k+2)/2)=2k+1.\n\nTotal cost:20*(4k+2) +40*(2k+1) +60*(k+1)=80k +40 +80k +40 +60k +60= (80k +80k +60k) +40 +40 +60=220k +140.\n\n220k +140 \u22641200 \u2192220k \u22641060 \u2192k \u22644.86, so k=4.\n\nThus, B=4*4+2=18, C=4+1=5, G=2*4+1=9.\n\nTotal items:18+9+5=32.\n\nNot as good as 37.\n\nNext, B=4k+3.\n\nThen, C= k+1 (since 4k+3 divided by 4 is k.75, ceil= k+1).\n\nG= floor((4k+3)/2)=2k+1 (since 4k+3 is odd, floor is 2k+1).\n\nTotal cost:20*(4k+3) +40*(2k+1) +60*(k+1)=80k +60 +80k +40 +60k +60= (80k +80k +60k) +60 +40 +60=220k +160.\n\n220k +160 \u22641200 \u2192220k \u22641040 \u2192k \u22644.72, so k=4.\n\nThus, B=4*4+3=19, C=4+1=5, G=2*4+1=9.\n\nTotal items:19+9+5=33.\n\nNot as good as 37.\n\nSo, from the above, when B=21, we get total items=37.\n\nIs this the maximum?\n\nWait, let's check for B=20, which is a multiple of 4.\n\nB=20, C=5, G=10.\n\nTotal items=35.\n\nBut when B=21, we have total items=37, which is better.\n\nLet me check if we can get higher.\n\nWait, when B=21, C=6, G=10.\n\nTotal cost:20*21 +40*10 +60*6=420 +400 +360=1180.\n\nWhich is within the budget.\n\nSo, we have $120 remaining.\n\nCan we use this to buy more items?\n\nYes, because 1180 \u22641200, so we have 20 left.\n\nBut how can we use this?\n\nWe can try to buy more books, games, or cushions.\n\nBut we have to maintain the constraints: B \u22652G and C \u2265 B/4.\n\nSo, let's see.\n\nCurrently, B=21, G=10, C=6.\n\nWe have 20 dollars left.\n\nWe can try to increase B, G, or C.\n\nBut let's see:\n\nTo increase B, each additional book costs $20.\n\nBut we need to check if B \u22652G.\n\nCurrently, B=21, G=10, so 21\u226520, which is okay.\n\nIf we buy 1 more book, B=22, then we need to check if 22\u22652G.\n\nSince G=10, 22\u226520, which is okay.\n\nBut we also need to adjust C if necessary.\n\nWait, but C must be at least B/4.\n\nCurrently, C=6, B=21, so 21/4=5.25, so C=6 is okay.\n\nIf we increase B to 22, C needs to be at least 22/4=5.5, so C=6 is still okay.\n\nBut let's check the total cost.\n\nIf we increase B by 1, cost becomes 20*(22) +40*10 +60*6=440 +400 +360=1200.\n\nSo, we can spend all 1200.\n\nSo, let's see:\n\nB=22, G=10, C=6.\n\nTotal items=22+10+6=38.\n\nThat's better than 37.\n\nWait, but is this allowed?\n\nYes, because B=22\u22652*10=20, so that's okay.\n\nC=6\u226522/4=5.5, so that's okay.\n\nTotal cost=20*22 +40*10 +60*6=440+400+360=1200.\n\nPerfect.\n\nSo, we can get 38 items.\n\nCan we go further?\n\nLet's see.\n\nIf we try to increase B further, say to 23.\n\nThen, C must be at least 23/4=5.75, so C=6.\n\nG can be up to floor(23/2)=11.\n\nBut currently, G=10.\n\nSo, let's see.\n\nIf we set B=23, G=11, C=6.\n\nTotal cost=20*23 +40*11 +60*6=460 +440 +360=1260.\n\nWhich is over the budget.\n\nSo, that's not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, we can reduce G and see if we can increase B.\n\nWait, but if we increase B to 23, we need to adjust G accordingly.\n\nWait, perhaps we can reduce G and compensate by buying more cushions.\n\nBut let's see.\n\nIf B=23, G=10, C=6.\n\nTotal cost=20*23 +40*10 +60*6=460+400+360=1220.\n\nThat's still over by 20.\n\nSo, we have 20 dollars left.\n\nWe can try to reduce G by 1, so G=9.\n\nThen, total cost=20*23 +40*9 +60*6=460+360+360=1180.\n\nNow, we have 20 left.\n\nWe can buy 1 more book: B=24.\n\nBut let's check constraints.\n\nB=24, G=9.\n\nCheck B \u22652G:24\u226518, yes.\n\nC=6\u226524/4=6, exactly.\n\nTotal cost=20*24 +40*9 +60*6=480+360+360=1200.\n\nSo, B=24, G=9, C=6.\n\nTotal items=24+9+6=39.\n\nThat's better.\n\nWait, so is this allowed?\n\nYes.\n\nB=24\u22652*9=18.\n\nC=6\u226524/4=6.\n\nTotal cost=1200.\n\nSo, that's valid.\n\nCan we go further?\n\nLet's try B=25.\n\nC=6 (since 25/4=6.25, so C=7?

End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: A small neighborhood library has received a donation of $1,200 to improve its children's section. The librarian needs to decide how to allocate this money among three options: new books ($20 each), educational games ($40 each), and comfortable seating cushions ($60 each). Based on feedback from patrons, the library should have at least twice as many books as games, and at least one cushion for every four books. What is the maximum number of total items (books, games, and cushions combined) that the library can purchase while staying within budget and meeting all requirements? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I've got this problem about a small neighborhood library that received a donation of $1,200 to improve its children's section. The librarian needs to decide how to allocate this money among three options: new books at $20 each, educational games at $40 each, and comfortable seating cushions at $60 each. The requirements are that the library should have at least twice as many books as games, and at least one cushion for every four books. The goal is to find the maximum number of total items (books, games, and cushions combined) that the library can purchase while staying within the budget and meeting all these requirements.\n\nOkay, let me break this down step by step. First, I need to define variables for each item. Let's let:\n\n- Let \\( b \\) be the number of books.\n- Let \\( g \\) be the number of educational games.\n- Let \\( c \\) be the number of cushions.\n\nNow, the total budget is $1,200. Each book costs $20, so the total cost for books is \\( 20b \\). Similarly, each game is $40, so the total cost for games is \\( 40g \\), and each cushion is $60, so the total cost for cushions is \\( 60c \\). Therefore, the total cost equation would be:\n\n\\[ 20b + 40g + 60c = 1200 \\]\n\nSimplifying this equation by dividing all terms by 20 to make the numbers smaller and easier to work with:\n\n\\[ b + 2g + 3c = 60 \\]\n\nSo that's our first equation.\n\nNext, the problem states that the library should have at least twice as many books as games. That means the number of books \\( b \\) is at least twice the number of games \\( g \\). So we can write this as:\n\n\\[ b \\geq 2g \\]\n\nOr, in other words,\n\n\\[ b = 2g + k \\]\n\nWhere \\( k \\) is some non-negative integer representing the extra books beyond twice the number of games. But since we're looking for the maximum number of items, it might be optimal to set \\( k = 0 \\) initially and see if it works, and if not, then consider increasing \\( k \\) as needed.\n\nThe second requirement is that there should be at least one cushion for every four books. So for every four books, there's at least one cushion. That means the number of cushions \\( c \\) should be at least \\( \\frac{b}{4} \\). But since \\( c \\) has to be an integer, we can write:\n\n\\[ c \\geq \\frac{b}{4} \\]\n\nAgain, since we're trying to maximize the total items, we can consider \\( c \\) as exactly \\( \\frac{b}{4} \\) if \\( b \\) is a multiple of 4, or the next whole number if \\( b \\) isn't. But let's see how that plays out.\n\nSo, our goal is to maximize \\( b + g + c \\), the total number of items. To do that, we can express everything in terms of one variable and then find the maximum within the constraints.\n\nLet me try substituting \\( b \\) from the second equation into the first. From \\( b \\geq 2g \\), let's express \\( b = 2g + k \\) where \\( k \\geq 0 \\). But perhaps it's better to express \\( g \\) in terms of \\( b \\): \\( g \\leq \\frac{b}{2} \\).\n\nSimilarly, from the cushion requirement, \\( c \\geq \\frac{b}{4} \\).\n\nSo, let's substitute \\( g \\) in terms of \\( b \\) and \\( c \\) in terms of \\( b \\) into the total cost equation.\n\nFrom the cost equation:\n\n\\[ b + 2g + 3c = 60 \\]\n\nExpress \\( g \\) as \\( g \\leq \\frac{b}{2} \\), and \\( c \\geq \\frac{b}{4} \\).\n\nTo maximize the total items, we want to minimize the number of games and cushions relative to books because books are the cheapest, so having more books allows us to have more total items without exceeding the budget.\n\nWait, actually, no. Because each book is cheaper, to maximize the number of items, we should buy as many books as possible, then games, and then cushions. But we have constraints that limit how many games and cushions we can buy based on the number of books.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to express everything in terms of \\( b \\), then express \\( g \\) and \\( c \\) in terms of \\( b \\) based on the constraints, and then find the value of \\( b \\) that allows the total items to be as large as possible without exceeding the budget.\n\nSo, let's proceed.\n\nFrom the cushion constraint: \\( c \\geq \\frac{b}{4} \\). Let's take \\( c = \\frac{b}{4} \\) (rounded up to the nearest whole number if necessary).\n\nFrom the book constraint: \\( g \\leq \\frac{b}{2} \\). Let's take \\( g = \\frac{b}{2} \\) (rounded down to the nearest whole number if necessary).\n\nBut wait, since \\( b \\), \\( g \\), and \\( c \\) must all be integers, we'll have to consider integer values. So perhaps it's better to express \\( g \\) as \\( g = \\lfloor \\frac{b}{2} \\rfloor \\) and \\( c = \\lceil \\frac{b}{4} \\rceil \\).\n\nHowever, this might complicate things. Maybe a better approach is to express \\( g \\) and \\( c \\) in terms of \\( b \\) and then substitute into the cost equation.\n\nSo, let's define:\n\n- \\( g \\leq \\frac{b}{2} \\)\n- \\( c \\geq \\frac{b}{4} \\)\n\nBut to maximize the total items, we need to minimize the amount spent on games and cushions. So, to spend as little as possible on games and cushions, we should set \\( g \\) as small as possible and \\( c \\) as small as possible, which would be \\( g = 0 \\) and \\( c = 0 \\), but we have constraints that require \\( g \\) to be at least 0, but also that \\( c \\) is at least \\( \\frac{b}{4} \\).\n\nWait, no. The constraints are:\n\n- \\( b \\geq 2g \\) \u21d2 \\( g \\leq \\frac{b}{2} \\)\n- \\( c \\geq \\frac{b}{4} \\)\n\nSo, the more books you have, the more games and cushions you can have, but the constraints require that \\( g \\) is at most half of \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) is at least a quarter of \\( b \\).\n\nBut since we want to maximize the total items \\( b + g + c \\), we need to find the combination where \\( g \\) is as large as possible (given \\( b \\)) and \\( c \\) is as large as possible (given \\( b \\)), but within the budget.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best way is to express \\( g \\) and \\( c \\) in terms of \\( b \\) and substitute into the budget equation.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nFrom the budget equation:\n\n\\[ b + 2g + 3c = 60 \\]\n\nFrom the constraints:\n\n1. \\( g \\leq \\frac{b}{2} \\)\n2. \\( c \\geq \\frac{b}{4} \\)\n\nTo maximize \\( b + g + c \\), we can express \\( g \\) as \\( g = \\frac{b}{2} \\) (since increasing \\( g \\) would increase the total items) and \\( c = \\frac{b}{4} \\) (since increasing \\( c \\) would also increase the total items). However, we must ensure that these values satisfy the budget equation.\n\nSo, substituting \\( g = \\frac{b}{2} \\) and \\( c = \\frac{b}{4} \\) into the budget equation:\n\n\\[ b + 2\\left(\\frac{b}{2}\\right) + 3\\left(\\frac{b}{4}\\right) = 60 \\]\n\nSimplify each term:\n\n- \\( b \\) remains as is.\n- \\( 2 \\times \\frac{b}{2} = b \\)\n- \\( 3 \\times \\frac{b}{4} = \\frac{3b}{4} \\)\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ b + b + \\frac{3b}{4} = 60 \\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\[ 2b + \\frac{3b}{4} = 60 \\]\n\nConvert to a common denominator:\n\n\\[ \\frac{8b}{4} + \\frac{3b}{4} = 60 \\]\n\nCombine:\n\n\\[ \\frac{11b}{4} = 60 \\]\n\nMultiply both sides by 4:\n\n\\[ 11b = 240 \\]\n\nDivide by 11:\n\n\\[ b = \\frac{240}{11} \\approx 21.818 \\]\n\nBut \\( b \\) must be an integer, so we check \\( b = 21 \\) and \\( b = 22 \\).\n\nFirst, \\( b = 21 \\):\n\n- \\( g = \\frac{21}{2} = 10.5 \\). Since \\( g \\) must be an integer, we take \\( g = 10 \\).\n- \\( c = \\frac{21}{4} = 5.25 \\). Since \\( c \\) must be an integer, we take \\( c = 6 \\) (rounded up).\n\nNow, check the budget:\n\n\\[ 20 \\times 21 + 40 \\times 10 + 60 \\times 6 = 420 + 400 + 360 = 1180 \\]\n\nBut $1,180 is within the $1,200 budget, leaving $20 unused. However, we might be able to reallocate that $20 to get more items.\n\nAlternatively, let's check \\( b = 22 \\):\n\n- \\( g = \\frac{22}{2} = 11 \\)\n- \\( c = \\frac{22}{4} = 5.5 \\), so \\( c = 6 \\)\n\nCheck the budget:\n\n\\[ 20 \\times 22 + 40 \\times 11 + 60 \\times 6 = 440 + 440 + 360 = 1,240 \\]\n\nThat's over the budget by $40. So, \\( b = 22 \\) is too much.\n\nTherefore, \\( b = 21 \\) is the maximum possible number of books, with \\( g = 10 \\) and \\( c = 6 \\), totaling 21 + 10 + 6 = 37 items, and spending $1,180. However, we have $20 left. Can we use that $20 to buy more items without violating the constraints?\n\nLet me think. If we have $20 left, perhaps we can buy more books, games, or cushions. Since books are the cheapest, buying more books would allow us to maximize the number of items.\n\nEach additional book costs $20, so with $20, we can buy 1 more book, making \\( b = 22 \\). But earlier, when \\( b = 22 \\), the total cost was $1,240, which is over the budget. So, perhaps we can adjust the number of games or cushions to stay within the budget.\n\nWait, maybe instead of buying an extra book, we can buy a combination of a book and something else. But let's see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can reduce the number of cushions to free up some money to buy more books or games.\n\nWait, let's try this. If we have $20 left, maybe we can buy 1 more book, but then we have to adjust the cushions or games.\n\nSo, if \\( b = 22 \\), \\( g = 11 \\), and \\( c = 5 \\) (instead of 6), then the total cost would be:\n\n\\[ 20 \\times 22 + 40 \\times 11 + 60 \\times 5 = 440 + 440 + 300 = 1,180 \\]\n\nWhich is within budget. But does this satisfy the constraints?\n\n- \\( b = 22 \\), \\( g = 11 \\): 22 \u2265 2\u00d711 \u21d2 22 \u2265 22 \u21d2 yes.\n- \\( c = 5 \\): 5 \u2265 22/4 = 5.5 \u21d2 5 \u2265 5.5 \u21d2 no. So this violates the cushion requirement.\n\nTherefore, we can't reduce cushions to 5 because it's less than 5.5, which is the required number.\n\nAlternatively, if we leave \\( c = 6 \\), we have:\n\nTotal cost: 440 + 440 + 360 = 1,240, which is over by $40.\n\nBut maybe we can reduce the number of games or adjust both.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe instead of increasing \\( b \\) to 22, we can buy more games or cushions with the remaining $20.\n\nWait, let's go back. With \\( b = 21 \\), \\( g = 10 \\), \\( c = 6 \\), total cost is $1,180. We have $20 left. Let's see what else we can buy.\n\nWe can either buy more books, games, or cushions. Let's see:\n\n- Buying 1 more book: +$20, total books=22, but then we have to adjust games or cushions.\n\n- Buying 1 more game: $40, which would take us over the budget by $20, so that's not possible.\n\n- Buying 1/3 of a cushion: $20 isn't enough for a cushion since they cost $60 each.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can buy a combination, like 1 book and 1 game, but that would cost $60, which is over the remaining $20.\n\nWait, no. The remaining money is $20, so we can't buy a cushion because they're $60 each. We can't buy a game because they're $40 each, which is more than $20. So, the only thing we can buy is 1 more book for $20, making \\( b = 22 \\), but then we have to adjust the other items to stay within the budget.\n\nSo, if \\( b = 22 \\), \\( g = 11 \\), and \\( c = 6 \\), the total cost is $1,240, which is over by $40. To fix this, we need to reduce the total cost by $40.\n\nHow can we do that? We can either reduce the number of games or cushions or both.\n\nLet's see. Each game costs $40, so reducing one game would save $40. That would bring the total cost down to $1,200 exactly.\n\nSo, if we set \\( b = 22 \\), \\( g = 10 \\), and \\( c = 6 \\), the total cost would be:\n\n\\[ 20 \\times 22 + 40 \\times 10 + 60 \\times 6 = 440 + 400 + 360 = 1,200 \\]\n\nYes, that works. Now, check the constraints:\n\n- \\( b = 22 \\), \\( g = 10 \\): 22 \u2265 2\u00d710 \u21d2 22 \u2265 20 \u21d2 yes.\n- \\( c = 6 \\): 6 \u2265 22/4 = 5.5 \u21d2 yes, since 6 \u2265 5.5.\n\nSo, this allocation satisfies all the constraints and uses the entire $1,200 budget.\n\nTherefore, the total number of items is 22 + 10 + 6 = 38 items.\n\nWait a minute, earlier when I set \\( b = 21 \\), \\( g = 10 \\), \\( c = 6 \\), I had 37 items, but by increasing \\( b \\) to 22 and decreasing \\( g \\) to 10 (from 11), I can get 38 items, which is more. So that's better.\n\nIs there a way to get even more items? Let's see.\n\nIf we set \\( b = 22 \\), \\( g = 10 \\), \\( c = 6 \\), total items = 38.\n\nIs there a way to increase \\( c \\) while decreasing \\( g \\) or \\( b \\) to get more items?\n\nWait, if we try to increase \\( c \\), that would require more money, which we don't have because we're already at the budget limit. Alternatively, maybe by adjusting \\( g \\) and \\( c \\) differently.\n\nAlternatively, let's try another approach. Let's express everything in terms of \\( b \\), and see what's the maximum \\( b \\) can be.\n\nFrom the budget equation:\n\n\\[ b + 2g + 3c = 60 \\]\n\nFrom the constraints:\n\n\\[ g \\leq \\frac{b}{2} \\]\n\\[ c \\geq \\frac{b}{4} \\]\n\nLet's express \\( g \\) as \\( g = \\frac{b}{2} - x \\), where \\( x \\geq 0 \\), and \\( c = \\frac{b}{4} + y \\), where \\( y \\geq 0 \\).\n\nSubstituting into the budget equation:\n\n\\[ b + 2\\left(\\frac{b}{2} - x\\right) + 3\\left(\\frac{b}{4} + y\\right) = 60 \\]\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\[ b + b - 2x + \\frac{3b}{4} + 3y = 60 \\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\[ b + b + \\frac{3b}{4} - 2x + 3y = 60 \\]\n\\[ (2 + 1 + 0.75)b - 2x + 3y = 60 \\]\n\\[ 3.75b - 2x + 3y = 60 \\]\n\nBut this might not be the most straightforward way. Maybe it's better to express \\( g \\) and \\( c \\) in terms of \\( b \\) and then see how much money is left.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that to maximize the total items, we need to maximize \\( b + g + c \\). Given that \\( b \\) is the cheapest, we should prioritize buying as many books as possible, then games, then cushions.\n\nBut the constraints tie \\( g \\) and \\( c \\) to \\( b \\). So, perhaps the optimal solution is when we have \\( g \\) as large as possible (i.e., \\( g = \\frac{b}{2} \\)) and \\( c \\) as small as possible (i.e., \\( c = \\frac{b}{4} \\)), but adjusted to fit the budget.\n\nWait, earlier when I tried \\( b = 22 \\), \\( g = 10 \\), \\( c = 6 \\), that worked and gave 38 items. Let's see if we can get a higher \\( b \\).\n\nSuppose \\( b = 24 \\):\n\n- \\( g = "

End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: A small neighborhood library has received a donation of $1,200 to improve its children's section. The librarian needs to decide how to allocate this money among three options: new books ($20 each), educational games ($40 each), and comfortable seating cushions ($60 each). Based on feedback from patrons, the library should have at least twice as many books as games, and at least one cushion for every four books. What is the maximum number of total items (books, games, and cushions combined) that the library can purchase while staying within budget and meeting all requirements? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this problem about a small neighborhood library that received $1,200 to improve its children's section. The librarian needs to decide how to allocate this money among three options: new books at $20 each, educational games at $40 each, and comfortable seating cushions at $60 each. The requirements are that the library should have at least twice as many books as games, and at least one cushion for every four books. The goal is to find the maximum number of total items (books, games, and cushions combined) that the library can purchase while staying within budget and meeting all these requirements.\n\nOkay, let me start by breaking down the problem. We have three variables here: the number of books, games, and cushions. Let's denote them as B, G, and C respectively. \n\nFirst, the budget is $1,200. So, the total cost for books, games, and cushions should not exceed $1,200. The cost for each item is given, so I can write an equation for the total cost:\n\n20B + 40G + 60C \u2264 1200\n\nNext, the librarian needs to ensure that there are at least twice as many books as games. That translates to:\n\nB \u2265 2G\n\nAlso, there needs to be at least one cushion for every four books. So, the number of cushions should be at least C \u2265 (1/4)B. Since the number of cushions has to be a whole number, I think that means C should be at least the ceiling of (1/4)B. But maybe I can represent it as C \u2265 (B/4). I'll keep that in mind.\n\nSo, summarizing the constraints:\n\n1. 20B + 40G + 60C \u2264 1200\n2. B \u2265 2G\n3. C \u2265 (B/4)\n\nAnd all variables B, G, C are non-negative integers.\n\nThe objective is to maximize the total number of items, which is:\n\nTotal = B + G + C\n\nSo, I need to find the maximum possible value of B + G + C given the constraints above.\n\nHmm, okay, so how do I approach this? Maybe I can express everything in terms of one variable and then find the maximum.\n\nLet me try to express G and C in terms of B. From the second constraint, B \u2265 2G, which means G \u2264 B/2. Since G has to be an integer, G can be at most floor(B/2). But maybe it's better to express G as a function of B, so G = k, where k \u2264 B/2.\n\nSimilarly, from the third constraint, C \u2265 B/4. So, C can be expressed as C = m, where m \u2265 B/4.\n\nBut maybe I can substitute these into the budget equation. Let's try that.\n\nFrom the second constraint, G \u2264 B/2. Let's let G = t, where t \u2264 B/2. Similarly, from the third constraint, C \u2265 B/4, so let's let C = s, where s \u2265 B/4.\n\nWait, but I need to express everything in terms of B to maximize the total. Alternatively, maybe I can find a way to express the total in terms of B and then find the optimal B.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can set up inequalities to express G and C in terms of B and then substitute into the budget constraint.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nFrom B \u2265 2G, we can write G \u2264 B/2.\n\nFrom C \u2265 B/4, we can write C \u2265 B/4.\n\nSo, to minimize the number of items, we can set G as small as possible and C as small as possible. But since we want to maximize the total number of items, we need to maximize B, G, and C, but within the budget. Hmm, but the constraints might limit how much we can spend on each.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to express the budget in terms of B and then express G and C in terms of B, and then find the maximum B such that the total cost doesn't exceed $1,200, and then maximize the total items.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nLet's let B be as large as possible, then G would be as large as possible given B, and C as large as possible given B.\n\nWait, but the problem is that increasing B might require more money, so we need to find a balance where B is large enough to satisfy the constraints but not so large that the budget is exceeded.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express G and C in terms of B and substitute into the budget equation.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nFrom B \u2265 2G, let's let G = B/2 (since we want to maximize G for a given B, because higher G would mean more items). Similarly, from C \u2265 B/4, let's let C = B/4.\n\nBut wait, if I set G = B/2 and C = B/4, then I can substitute these into the budget equation.\n\nSo, the total cost would be:\n\n20B + 40*(B/2) + 60*(B/4) \u2264 1200\n\nLet me compute that.\n\n20B + 40*(B/2) = 20B + 20B = 40B\n\n60*(B/4) = 15B\n\nSo total cost = 40B + 15B = 55B\n\nSo, 55B \u2264 1200\n\nTherefore, B \u2264 1200 / 55 \u2248 21.818\n\nSince B must be an integer, the maximum possible B is 21.\n\nWait, but let me check that. If B=21, then G=21/2=10.5, but G must be an integer, so G=10.\n\nSimilarly, C=21/4=5.25, so C=5.\n\nWait, but if B=21, G=10, and C=5, let's compute the total cost:\n\n20*21 + 40*10 + 60*5 = 420 + 400 + 300 = 1120\n\nThat's within the budget. So, the total items would be 21+10+5=36.\n\nBut wait, is this the maximum possible? Because if B=21, G=10, C=5, total items 36.\n\nBut perhaps we can get a higher total by having a lower B but higher G and C.\n\nWait, because the total items depend on B, G, and C. So, maybe if we reduce B a bit, we can increase G and C more, leading to a higher total.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can find a better allocation where B is a multiple of 4, so that C can be an integer.\n\nWait, let me think again.\n\nIf B is 24, which is a multiple of 4, then C=6, and G=12 (since G must be at least half of B, but wait, if B=24, G can be up to 12.\n\nWait, but 24*20 + 12*40 + 6*60 = 480 + 480 + 360 = 1320, which is over the budget.\n\nSo, that's too much.\n\nSo, B=24 is too much.\n\nWhat about B=20?\n\nThen G can be up to 10, and C can be 5.\n\nTotal cost: 20*20 + 40*10 + 60*5 = 400 + 400 + 300 = 1100.\n\nTotal items: 20+10+5=35.\n\nBut when B=21, G=10, C=5, total items=36, which is better.\n\nWait, but when B=21, G=10, C=5, total cost=1120, which is under 1200.\n\nSo, perhaps we can use the remaining $80 (1200-1120=80) to buy more items.\n\nBut how?\n\nBecause the librarian can allocate the money to buy more of any item, as long as the constraints are met.\n\nSo, perhaps we can increase G or C beyond the minimal required.\n\nWait, but the constraints are:\n\n- B \u2265 2G\n\n- C \u2265 B/4\n\nSo, if B=21, G can be up to 10 (since 21/2=10.5, so G=10), and C can be at least 5.25, so C=5.\n\nBut if we have $80 left, perhaps we can buy more G or C.\n\nBut we have to make sure that B \u2265 2G and C \u2265 B/4.\n\nSo, let's see.\n\nWe have B=21, G=10, C=5, total cost=1120.\n\nRemaining budget=1200-1120=80.\n\nWe can try to buy more G or C.\n\nLet me see.\n\nIf we buy more G:\n\nEach G costs $40, so with $80, we can buy 2 more G, making G=12.\n\nBut check if B \u2265 2G.\n\nB=21, 2G=24, which is more than 21, so that violates the constraint. So, we cannot buy more G beyond 10 when B=21.\n\nAlternatively, we can buy more C.\n\nEach C costs $60, so with $80, we can buy 1 more C, making C=6.\n\nCheck if C \u2265 B/4.\n\nB=21, B/4=5.25, so C=6 \u22655.25, which is okay.\n\nSo, with B=21, G=10, C=6, total cost=20*21 +40*10 +60*6=420+400+360=1180, which is still under budget.\n\nTotal items=21+10+6=37.\n\nThat's better.\n\nCan we do more? Let's see.\n\nWe have $20 left now (1200-1180=20).\n\nCan we buy more?\n\nIf we buy another C, that would cost $60, which is over the budget. So, no.\n\nAlternatively, buy more G, but as before, G=11 would require B=22, which would violate B \u22652G (22 \u226522), but B=21, so G=10.5, but G must be integer, so G=10.\n\nWait, no, B=21, so G can be up to 10. If we try to increase G beyond 10, say to 11, then B would need to be at least 22, which we don't have.\n\nSo, we can't increase G further.\n\nAlternatively, can we increase B beyond 21?\n\nWait, when B=21, we have total cost=1180, which leaves $20.\n\nIf we increase B by 1, to 22, then G can be up to 11, and C can be at least 5.5, so C=6.\n\nCompute the cost:\n\n20*22 +40*11 +60*6=440+440+360=1240, which is over the budget.\n\nSo, that's too much.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can adjust G and C differently.\n\nWait, let's think differently.\n\nLet me set up equations.\n\nLet me let B be the number of books, G the number of games, and C the number of cushions.\n\nWe have the constraints:\n\n1. B \u2265 2G \u21d2 G \u2264 B/2\n\n2. C \u2265 B/4\n\n3. 20B +40G +60C \u22641200\n\nOur goal is to maximize B + G + C.\n\nLet me express everything in terms of B.\n\nFrom constraint 1, G \u2264 B/2.\n\nFrom constraint 2, C \u2265 B/4.\n\nTo maximize the total, we want G as large as possible and C as large as possible, given B.\n\nSo, let's set G = floor(B/2) and C = ceil(B/4).\n\nBut since B must be an integer, and G and C as well, perhaps it's better to express G and C in terms of B.\n\nAlternatively, let's express G and C as multiples of B.\n\nWait, but perhaps a better approach is to write G = (B - x)/2, where x is some non-negative integer such that B -x is even, but this might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write G = B/2 - k, where k is some integer \u22650, but that might not be straightforward.\n\nWait, maybe I can consider that for a given B, the maximum G is floor(B/2), and the maximum C is ceil(B/4).\n\nBut perhaps I can think in terms of B being a multiple of 4, to make C an integer.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nLet me let B =4m, where m is an integer \u22651.\n\nThen, C \u2265 B/4 = m, so C = m.\n\nAlso, G \u2264 B/2 =2m.\n\nTo maximize the total, we can set G=2m.\n\nSo, total cost would be:\n\n20*(4m) +40*(2m) +60*(m) =80m +80m +60m=220m\n\nWe have 220m \u22641200 \u21d2 m \u22641200/220\u22485.454, so m=5.\n\nSo, B=20, G=10, C=5.\n\nTotal items=35.\n\nBut earlier, when B=21, G=10, C=6, total items=37, which is better.\n\nWait, but B=21 is not a multiple of 4, so C=ceil(21/4)=6.\n\nHmm, so perhaps letting B not be a multiple of 4 can give a better total.\n\nSo, perhaps I should consider B as any integer, not necessarily a multiple of 4.\n\nSo, let's proceed differently.\n\nLet me express G and C in terms of B.\n\nFrom constraint 1: G \u2264 B/2.\n\nFrom constraint 2: C \u2265 B/4.\n\nTo maximize the total items, we should maximize G and C, so set G= floor(B/2) and C=ceil(B/4).\n\nBut since B can be any integer, perhaps I can express G and C in terms of B.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model this as an integer linear programming problem, but since I'm doing this manually, let's try to find the optimal B.\n\nLet me try different values of B and see what gives the maximum total.\n\nStart with B=20.\n\nThen G can be up to 10, C at least 5.\n\nTotal cost=20*20 +40*10 +60*5=400+400+300=1100.\n\nTotal items=35.\n\nWith remaining $100, perhaps we can buy more.\n\nWait, but how? Because we have already allocated the minimal required for G and C.\n\nWait, no, the constraints are that G must be \u226410 and C must be \u22655.\n\nBut we can choose to buy more G or C beyond that, as long as the budget allows.\n\nSo, let's see.\n\nWith B=20, G=10, C=5, total cost=1100.\n\nRemaining budget=100.\n\nWe can try to buy more G or C.\n\nEach G costs $40, so with $100, we can buy 2 more G, making G=12.\n\nBut check if B \u22652G: 20 \u226524? No, that's not possible. So, we can't buy more G beyond 10.\n\nAlternatively, buy more C: each C costs $60, so with $100, we can buy 1 more C, making C=6.\n\nCheck if C=6 \u226520/4=5, which is okay.\n\nSo, total items=20+12+6=38? Wait, no, wait: if B=20, G=12, C=6, but B must be \u22652G, which is 20\u226524? No, that's not true. So, that's invalid.\n\nWait, so if B=20, G cannot be more than 10. So, G=12 is invalid because 20<24.\n\nTherefore, we can't buy more G beyond 10 when B=20.\n\nSo, with B=20, G=10, C=6, total cost=20*20 +40*10 +60*6=400+400+360=1160.\n\nTotal items=20+10+6=36.\n\nThat's better than 35.\n\nAlternatively, with B=20, G=10, C=5, total items=35, but we can spend the remaining $100 on C, making C=5+1=6, so total items=36.\n\nSo, 36 items.\n\nBut earlier, when B=21, G=10, C=6, total items=37, which is better.\n\nSo, let's try B=21.\n\nThen, G can be up to 10 (since 21/2=10.5, so G=10).\n\nC must be at least 21/4=5.25, so C=6.\n\nTotal cost=20*21 +40*10 +60*6=420+400+360=1180.\n\nTotal items=21+10+6=37.\n\nRemaining budget=20.\n\nCan we buy more?\n\nWe can try to buy more C: each C is $60, so with $20, we can't buy another C.\n\nAlternatively, buy more G: each G is $40, so with $20, we can't buy another G.\n\nSo, total remains at 37.\n\nAlternatively, can we increase B beyond 21?\n\nLet's try B=22.\n\nThen, G can be up to 11 (since 22/2=11).\n\nC must be at least 22/4=5.5, so C=6.\n\nTotal cost=20*22 +40*11 +60*6=440+440+360=1240, which is over the budget.\n\nSo, that's not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, can we have B=22, G=11, C=5 (since 22/4=5.5, so C=6).\n\nBut total cost=440+440+360=1240>1200.\n\nSo, no.\n\nAlternatively, reduce C to 5, but then 5 <5.5? No, because 5<5.5, so that violates the constraint.\n\nSo, C must be at least 6.\n\nTherefore, B=22 is too expensive.\n\nWhat about B=21, G=10, C=6, total cost=1180, remaining=20.\n\nAs before, can't buy more.\n\nAlternatively, let's try B=19.\n\nThen, G can be up to 9 (since 19/2=9.5, so G=9).\n\nC must be at least 19/4=4.75, so C=5.\n\nTotal cost=20*19 +40*9 +60*5=380+360+300=1040.\n\nRemaining budget=160.\n\nWe can try to buy more G and C.\n\nEach G is $40, so 160/40=4, so G=9+4=13.\n\nBut check if B=19 \u22652G=26? No, that's not true. So, can't increase G beyond 9.\n\nAlternatively, buy more C: each C is $60, so 160/60\u22482.666, so we can buy 2 more C, making C=5+2=7"

Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's define the variables:\n\n- Let \\( b \\) be the number of new books.\n- Let \\( g \\) be the number of educational games.\n- Let \\( c \\) be the number of comfortable seating cushions.\n\nEach book costs $20, each game costs $40, and each cushion costs $60. So, the total cost can be represented by the equation:\n\n\\[ 20b + 40g + 60c \\leq 1200 \\]\n\nNow, the library has some constraints based on the feedback:\n\n1. **At least twice as many books as games**: This means the number of books is at least two times the number of games.\n\n   Mathematically, this can be written as:\n   \n   \\[ b \\geq 2g \\]\n\n2. **At least one cushion for every four books**: For every four books, there should be at least one cushion. This means the number of cushions is at least one-fourth of the number of books.\n\n   So, the constraint is:\n   \n   \\[ c \\geq \\frac{b}{4} \\]\n\nOur goal is to maximize the total number of items, which is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total Items} = b + g + c \\]\n\nTo maximize this, we need to express \\( c \\) in terms of \\( b \\) and \\( g \\) using the constraints and substitute back into the budget equation. Let's start by expressing \\( c \\) in terms of \\( b \\).\n\nFrom the second constraint:\n\n\\[ c \\geq \\frac{b}{4} \\]\n\nTo find the maximum \\( c \\) without exceeding the budget, we'll use the minimum required \\( c \\) to free up more money for books and games. So, let's set \\( c = \\frac{b}{4} \\).\n\nNow, substitute \\( c = \\frac{b}{4} \\) into the budget equation:\n\n\\[ 20b + 40g + 60\\left(\\frac{b}{4}\\right) \\leq 1200 \\]\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\nFirst, calculate \\( 60 \\times \\frac{b}{4} \\):\n\\[ 60 \\times \\frac{b}{4} = 15b \\]\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 20b + 40g + 15b \\leq 1200 \\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n\\[ 35b + 40g \\leq 1200 \\]\n\nNow, from the first constraint \\( b \\geq 2g \\), we can express \\( g \\) in terms of \\( b \\):\n\n\\[ g \\leq \\frac{b}{2} \\]\n\nLet's substitute \\( g \\) with \\( \\frac{b}{2} \\) in the budget equation to find the maximum \\( b \\) possible.\n\nSo, substituting \\( g = \\frac{b}{2} \\):\n\n\\[ 35b + 40\\left(\\frac{b}{2}\\right) \\leq 1200 \\]\n\nSimplify:\n\nFirst, calculate \\( 40 \\times \\frac{b}{2} \\):\n\\[ 40 \\times \\frac{b}{2} = 20b \\]\n\nNow, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 35b + 20b \\leq 1200 \\]\n\\[ 55b \\leq 1200 \\]\n\nSolving for \\( b \\):\n\n\\[ b \\leq \\frac{1200}{55} \\]\n\\[ b \\leq 21.\\overline{81} \\]\n\nSince the number of books must be a whole number, we take the integer part:\n\n\\[ b \\leq 21 \\]\n\nWait a second, let me double-check that calculation because 55 times 21 is 1155, which is less than 1200. Let me see how much money is left after buying 21 books.\n\nCalculate the total cost for 21 books:\n\n\\[ 21 \\times 20 = 420 \\]\n\nThen, \\( c = \\frac{21}{4} = 5.25 \\), but since we can't have a fraction of a cushion, we need to round up to 6 cushions. However, if we do that, the total cost might exceed the budget. Let me verify.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake here. Earlier, I substituted \\( g = \\frac{b}{2} \\) into the budget equation, but perhaps I should consider that \\( g \\) could be less than \\( \\frac{b}{2} \\) to allow more money for books and cushions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should express \\( g \\) in terms of \\( b \\) and substitute accordingly.\n\nLet me try another approach. Let's express \\( g \\) as \\( g = \\frac{b}{2} - x \\), where \\( x \\) is a non-negative integer. This way, \\( g \\) is less than or equal to \\( \\frac{b}{2} \\). But this might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, let's express \\( g \\) in terms of \\( b \\) and substitute into the budget equation.\n\nFrom \\( b \\geq 2g \\), we can write \\( g \\leq \\frac{b}{2} \\). So, to maximize the number of items, we should take \\( g \\) as large as possible, which is \\( g = \\frac{b}{2} \\). Therefore, substituting \\( g = \\frac{b}{2} \\) is correct.\n\nSo, going back to the equation:\n\n\\[ 35b + 40g \\leq 1200 \\]\n\nSubstituting \\( g = \\frac{b}{2} \\):\n\n\\[ 35b + 40 \\times \\frac{b}{2} \\leq 1200 \\]\n\\[ 35b + 20b \\leq 1200 \\]\n\\[ 55b \\leq 1200 \\]\n\\[ b \\leq \\frac{1200}{55} \\approx 21.81 \\]\n\nSince \\( b \\) must be an integer, \\( b = 21 \\).\n\nNow, calculate \\( g \\):\n\n\\[ g = \\frac{b}{2} = \\frac{21}{2} = 10.5 \\]\n\nBut \\( g \\) must be an integer. So, \\( g = 10 \\) because we can't have half a game. Wait, but if \\( b = 21 \\) and \\( g = 10 \\), does that satisfy \\( b \\geq 2g \\)?\n\nLet's check:\n\n\\[ 21 \\geq 2 \\times 10 \\]\n\\[ 21 \\geq 20 \\]\n\nYes, that's okay. So, \\( g = 10 \\).\n\nNow, calculate \\( c \\):\n\n\\[ c = \\frac{b}{4} = \\frac{21}{4} = 5.25 \\]\n\nAgain, \\( c \\) must be an integer, so we round up to 6 cushions.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total cost:\n\nBooks: 21 x $20 = $420\nGames: 10 x $40 = $400\nCushions: 6 x $60 = $360\nTotal: $420 + $400 + $360 = $1,180\n\nWe have $20 left unallocated, but since we can't buy more items without exceeding the budget, we'll have to stick with this.\n\nNow, let's check if we can increase \\( b \\) to 22.\n\nIf \\( b = 22 \\), then:\n\n\\[ g \\leq \\frac{22}{2} = 11 \\]\nSo, \\( g = 11 \\).\n\nCalculate the cost:\n\nBooks: 22 x $20 = $440\nGames: 11 x $40 = $440\nCushions: \\( c = \\frac{22}{4} = 5.5 \\), rounded up to 6.\n\nTotal cost: $440 + $440 + $360 = $1,240\n\nThat's over the budget by $40. So, we can't take \\( b = 22 \\).\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can reduce \\( g \\) to 10 and see if we can have \\( b = 22 \\) and \\( c = 5 \\).\n\nWait, but \\( c = 5 \\) would mean \\( 5 = \\frac{22}{4} = 5.5 \\), which is less than 5.5, so it's okay, but we need at least one cushion for every four books, so 5.5 would require 6 cushions. So, we can't have \\( c = 5 \\) if \\( b = 22 \\). Therefore, \\( c \\) must be at least 6 when \\( b = 22 \\).\n\nSo, with \\( b = 22 \\), \\( g = 11 \\), and \\( c = 6 \\), the total cost is $440 + $440 + $360 = $1,240, which is over by $40. So, we can't do that.\n\nWhat if we reduce \\( c \\) to 5? Then, the cost would be $440 + $440 + $300 = $1,180, which is within budget. But does that satisfy the constraint?\n\nWait, if \\( b = 22 \\), \\( c = 5 \\), then \\( c = \\frac{22}{4} = 5.5 \\), so 5 is less than 5.5, which violates the constraint of having at least one cushion for every four books. Therefore, \\( c \\) must be at least 6 when \\( b = 22 \\).\n\nSo, \\( b = 22 \\) is not possible without exceeding the budget.\n\nTherefore, the maximum \\( b \\) we can have is 21.\n\nBut let's check if \\( b = 21 \\) and \\( g = 10 \\), \\( c = 6 \\), as before, which gives a total of $1,180, leaving $20 unallocated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can adjust \\( g \\) and \\( c \\) differently to use up the remaining $20.\n\nFor example, if we take \\( b = 21 \\), \\( g = 10 \\), \\( c = 6 \\), total spent is $1,180. We have $20 left.\n\nCan we buy more items without violating the constraints?\n\nLet's see. To buy more books, we'd need to have \\( b = 21 + x \\), but that would require \\( g \\) to increase as well, which might not be possible without exceeding the budget.\n\nAlternatively, we can see if we can buy more cushions or games with the remaining $20.\n\nEach cushion is $60, so we can't buy more with $20. Each game is $40, so we can buy one more game for $40, which would exceed the budget. Alternatively, buy half a game, but that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can reduce the number of cushions to free up some money.\n\nIf we have \\( b = 21 \\), \\( g = 10 \\), \\( c = 6 \\), total cost is $1,180. Let's see if we can reduce \\( c \\) to 5 and use the saved $5 (since 6x60=360, 5x60=300, so saving $60) but then we can use that $60 to buy more books or games.\n\nWait, but reducing \\( c \\) to 5 would mean \\( c = 5 \\), which is less than \\( \\frac{21}{4} = 5.25 \\), so it violates the constraint. Therefore, \\( c \\) must be at least 6 when \\( b = 21 \\).\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can reduce \\( g \\) to 9, which would allow us to increase \\( c \\) to 6, but let's check:\n\nIf \\( g = 9 \\), then:\n\nTotal cost would be:\n\nBooks: 21x20=420\nGames: 9x40=360\nCushions: 6x60=360\nTotal: 420+360+360=1,140\n\nThen, we have $60 left. Can we use that to buy more books or games.\n\nEach book is $20, so 3 more books would cost $60, making \\( b = 24 \\), but then \\( g \\) needs to be at least 12 (since \\( b \\geq 2g \\)), so \\( g = 12 \\).\n\nCalculate cost:\n\nBooks: 24x20=480\nGames: 12x40=480\nCushions: 6x60=360\nTotal: 480+480+360=1,320 > 1,200\n\nThat's over the budget. So, can't do that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe buy 3 more books and 1 more game:\n\nBooks: 24x20=480\nGames: 10x40=400\nCushions: 6x60=360\nTotal: 480+400+360=1,240 >1,200\n\nStill over.\n\nAlternatively, buy 2 more books and 1 more game:\n\nBooks: 23x20=460\nGames: 11x40=440\nCushions: 6x60=360\nTotal: 460+440+360=1,260 >1,200\n\nStill over.\n\nAlternatively, buy 1 more book and 1 more game:\n\nBooks: 22x20=440\nGames: 11x40=440\nCushions: 6x60=360\nTotal: 440+440+360=1,240 >1,200\n\nStill over.\n\nSo, it seems that reducing \\( g \\) to 9 and increasing \\( b \\) to 24 is not possible without exceeding the budget.\n\nAlternatively, maybe reduce \\( g \\) to 10, \\( c \\) to 5, but that would violate the cushion constraint.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to express all variables in terms of \\( b \\) and then find the maximum \\( b \\) such that the total cost is within budget.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nWe have:\n\n\\[ c \\geq \\frac{b}{4} \\]\n\\[ g \\leq \\frac{b}{2} \\]\n\nSubstitute \\( g = \\frac{b}{2} \\) and \\( c = \\frac{b}{4} \\) into the budget equation:\n\n\\[ 20b + 40\\left(\\frac{b}{2}\\right) + 60\\left(\\frac{b}{4}\\right) \\leq 1200 \\]\n\\[ 20b + 20b + 15b \\leq 1200 \\]\n\\[ 55b \\leq 1200 \\]\n\\[ b \\leq \\frac{1200}{55} \\approx 21.81 \\]\n\nSo, \\( b = 21 \\) as before.\n\nThen, \\( g = 10 \\) and \\( c = 6 \\), total items = 21 + 10 + 6 = 37.\n\nBut wait, earlier when I tried \\( b = 21 \\), \\( g = 10 \\), \\( c = 6 \\), total cost was $1,180, leaving $20.\n\nIs there a way to use that $20 to get more items without violating constraints?\n\nSince each book is $20, we can buy 1 more book, making \\( b = 22 \\), but then \\( g \\) must be at least 11 (since \\( 22 \\geq 2 \\times 11 \\)). Let's see:\n\nBooks: 22x20=440\nGames: 11x40=440\nCushions: \\( c = \\frac{22}{4} = 5.5 \\), so 6.\n\nTotal cost: 440 + 440 + 360 = 1,240 >1,200.\n\nOver by $40. So, can't do that.\n\nAlternatively, if we reduce \\( c \\) to 5, which is less than 5.5, but violates the constraint. So, not allowed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe reduce \\( g \\) to 10 and \\( c \\) to 6, but then \\( b = 22 \\) and \\( g = 10 \\) would require \\( 22 \\geq 2 \\times 10 \\), which is okay, but \\( c = 6 \\) is less than 5.5, which is not allowed. So, \\( c \\) must be at least 6.\n\nTherefore, \\( b = 21 \\), \\( g = 10 \\), \\( c = 6 \\) is the maximum possible without exceeding the budget.\n\nBut let's check if there's another combination where \\( b \\) is less than 21 but allows more total items.\n\nSuppose \\( b = 20 \\), then \\( g \\leq 10 \\) and \\( c \\geq 5 \\).\n\nIf \\( b = 20 \\), \\( g = 10 \\), \\( c = 5 \\), total cost:\n\n20x20=400\n10x40=400\n5x60=300\nTotal=1,100\n\nLeaving $100 unallocated.

End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: A small neighborhood library has received a donation of $1,200 to improve its children's section. The librarian needs to decide how to allocate this money among three options: new books ($20 each), educational games ($40 each), and comfortable seating cushions ($60 each). Based on feedback from patrons, the library should have at least twice as many books as games, and at least one cushion for every four books. What is the maximum number of total items (books, games, and cushions combined) that the library can purchase while staying within budget and meeting all requirements? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I need to help the librarian figure out how to spend the $1,200 donation to maximize the number of items they can buy, given the constraints. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's list out the options and their costs:\n- New books: $20 each\n- Educational games: $40 each\n- Comfortable seating cushions: $60 each\n\nNow, the constraints are:\n1. The number of books must be at least twice the number of games.\n2. There needs to be at least one cushion for every four books.\n\nOur goal is to maximize the total number of items (books + games + cushions) without exceeding the budget.\n\nI think I should define variables for each item to make this easier:\n- Let B = number of books\n- Let G = number of games\n- Let C = number of cushions\n\nFrom the first constraint: B \u2265 2G. So, the number of books has to be at least double the number of games.\n\nFrom the second constraint: C \u2265 (1/4)B. That means for every four books, there should be at least one cushion. So, C needs to be at least B/4.\n\nNow, the total cost equation would be:\n20B + 40G + 60C \u2264 1200.\n\nOur objective is to maximize B + G + C.\n\nSince we're dealing with integers (you can't buy a fraction of a book or a cushion), I might need to use some algebra or maybe even set up a system of equations to solve this.\n\nLet me try expressing everything in terms of B, since B is related to G and C.\n\nFrom the first constraint: G \u2264 B/2.\n\nFrom the second constraint: C \u2265 B/4.\n\nSo, I can express G and C in terms of B.\n\nLet me define G in terms of B. Let's say G = (B/2) - x, where x is some non-negative integer (since we can't have more games than allowed by the constraint). Wait, actually, to maximize G, we should set G as high as possible without violating B \u2265 2G. So, G = floor(B/2), but since B and G are integers, G can be at most B/2 if B is even, or (B-1)/2 if B is odd.\n\nSimilarly, for C, since C must be at least B/4, we can set C = B/4 + y, where y is a non-negative integer. But since C has to be an integer, B/4 might not be an integer, so we need to round up if necessary.\n\nThis might get a bit complicated. Maybe I should try to express G and C in terms of B and then find the combination that fits within the budget.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express the total cost in terms of B, G, and C, and then find the maximum B + G + C.\n\nWait, let's try substituting the constraints into the cost equation.\n\nFrom B \u2265 2G, we can say G \u2264 B/2.\n\nFrom C \u2265 B/4, we can say C = B/4 + k, where k is a non-negative integer (since C has to be at least B/4, so k \u2265 0).\n\nSimilarly, G can be expressed as G = B/2 - m, where m is a non-negative integer (since G can't exceed B/2, so m \u2265 0).\n\nBut I think this might not be the most straightforward way. Maybe I should try to find possible values of B, G, and C that satisfy the constraints and see which combination gives the highest total items without exceeding $1,200.\n\nLet me consider that to maximize the number of items, we want to buy as many books as possible because they are the cheapest per item. But we also need to satisfy the cushion requirement.\n\nLet me try to express everything in terms of B.\n\nGiven that C \u2265 B/4, and the cost of C is $60 each, so the minimum cost for C is (B/4)*60.\n\nSimilarly, G can be up to B/2, so the maximum cost for G is (B/2)*40.\n\nSo, the total cost would be:\n\n20B + 40*(B/2) + 60*(B/4) \u2264 1200.\n\nWait, that's if we buy exactly the minimum C and maximum G. But we might need to adjust because B, G, and C have to be integers, and also because we can't exceed the budget.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n20B + 40*(B/2) + 60*(B/4) = 20B + 20B + 15B = 55B.\n\nSo, 55B \u2264 1200 \u2192 B \u2264 1200/55 \u2248 21.818. So B can be at most 21.\n\nWait, but if B is 21, then C = 21/4 = 5.25, which we need to round up to 6 cushions.\n\nSimilarly, G would be B/2 = 10.5, which would be 10 games.\n\nSo, let's check the total cost:\n\nBooks: 21 * 20 = $420\n\nGames: 10 * 40 = $400\n\nCushions: 6 * 60 = $360\n\nTotal cost: 420 + 400 + 360 = $1,180, which is within budget.\n\nTotal items: 21 + 10 + 6 = 37.\n\nIs this the maximum?\n\nWait, let's see if we can have a higher B.\n\nIf B = 22, then C = 22/4 = 5.5 \u2192 6 cushions.\n\nG = 22/2 = 11.\n\nCompute total cost:\n\n22*20 = $440\n\n11*40 = $440\n\n6*60 = $360\n\nTotal: 440 + 440 + 360 = $1,240, which exceeds the budget.\n\nSo, B=22 is too much.\n\nWhat about B=21, but maybe buying more games or cushions?\n\nWait, if B=21, G can be up to 10 (since G \u2264 B/2=10.5, so 10 games).\n\nC needs to be at least 5.25, so 6 cushions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can reduce the number of games to buy more cushions or something else.\n\nBut wait, the total cost is already $1,180, which leaves $20 remaining. Maybe we can use that $20 to buy more items.\n\nBut the cheapest items are books at $20 each. So, with $20, we can buy one more book, making B=22, but that would require increasing G and C as well, which might exceed the budget.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use the remaining $20 to buy one more book, but then we have to adjust G and C accordingly.\n\nWait, if we have B=21, and we have $20 left, maybe we can buy an extra book, making B=22. Then, G would have to be 11 (since G \u2264 22/2=11), and C would have to be at least 22/4=5.5, so 6.\n\nSo, total cost would be:\n\n22*20=440\n\n11*40=440\n\n6*60=360\n\nTotal=440+440+360=1,240, which is over the budget.\n\nSo, that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can buy 5 more books with the $20, but that would require adjusting G and C.\n\nWait, no, $20 is the cost of one book. So, we can only buy one more book.\n\nBut that would push B to 22, which as we saw, makes the total cost exceed $1,200.\n\nSo, maybe B=21 is the maximum possible.\n\nBut let's check if B=21 is indeed the best, or if there's a way to have a higher total number of items with a lower B but more G and C.\n\nWait, for example, maybe B=20.\n\nThen, C \u2265 20/4=5.\n\nG \u2264 20/2=10.\n\nTotal cost:\n\n20*20=400\n\n10*40=400\n\n5*60=300\n\nTotal=400+400+300=1,100, which is under budget.\n\nTotal items=20+10+5=35, which is less than 37.\n\nSo, worse than B=21.\n\nWhat about B=18.\n\nC \u226518/4=4.5\u21925.\n\nG \u226418/2=9.\n\nTotal cost:\n\n18*20=360\n\n9*40=360\n\n5*60=300\n\nTotal=360+360+300=1,020.\n\nTotal items=18+9+5=32.\n\nStill less than 37.\n\nWhat about B=19.\n\nC\u226519/4=4.75\u21925.\n\nG\u226419/2=9.5\u21929.\n\nTotal cost:\n\n19*20=380\n\n9*40=360\n\n5*60=300\n\nTotal=380+360+300=1,040.\n\nTotal items=19+9+5=33.\n\nStill less than 37.\n\nB=20: 35\n\nB=21:37\n\nB=22: over budget.\n\nSo, B=21 seems better.\n\nBut let's see if there's another combination where B is less, but we can have more G and C, leading to more total items.\n\nFor example, suppose B=20.\n\nThen, C=5, G=10.\n\nTotal items=35.\n\nBut maybe if we reduce B a bit, we can increase G and C more.\n\nWait, let's think differently.\n\nSuppose we set B to a value where the remaining money can be used to buy more G and C.\n\nLet me consider the budget: 1200.\n\nIf I buy B books, then the remaining money is 1200 - 20B.\n\nThis remaining money must be used to buy G and C, with G \u2264 B/2 and C \u2265 B/4.\n\nSo, let's denote:\n\nTotal cost for G and C: 40G + 60C.\n\nWe have:\n\n40G + 60C \u2264 1200 - 20B.\n\nAlso, G \u2264 B/2 and C \u2265 B/4.\n\nOur goal is to maximize B + G + C.\n\nLet me try to express G and C in terms of B.\n\nLet me denote G = x, C = y.\n\nWe have:\n\nx \u2264 B/2\n\ny \u2265 B/4\n\nSo, to maximize x + y, we need to set x as high as possible and y as high as possible.\n\nBut y is constrained by both B and the budget.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express y in terms of B and x.\n\nFrom the budget:\n\n40x + 60y \u2264 1200 - 20B.\n\nAlso, y \u2265 B/4.\n\nSo, let's substitute y = B/4 + z, where z \u2265 0.\n\nThen:\n\n40x + 60(B/4 + z) \u2264 1200 - 20B.\n\nSimplify:\n\n40x + 15B + 60z \u2264 1200 - 20B.\n\nBring like terms together:\n\n40x + 60z \u2264 1200 - 20B - 15B \u2192 40x + 60z \u2264 1200 - 35B.\n\nOur goal is to maximize x + (B/4 + z) = x + B/4 + z.\n\nSo, the total items would be B + x + y = B + x + (B/4 + z) = (5B/4) + x + z.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Maybe I should try specific values of B.\n\nWe saw that B=21 gives total items=37, which is quite good.\n\nLet me check B=21:\n\nTotal cost for books: 21*20=420\n\nRemaining budget: 1200-420=780.\n\nNow, G can be up to 10 (since 21/2=10.5, so 10).\n\nC must be at least 21/4=5.25, so 6.\n\nSo, G=10, C=6.\n\nTotal cost for G and C: 10*40 +6*60=400+360=760.\n\nTotal cost: 420+760=1,180, which is within budget.\n\nTotal items:21+10+6=37.\n\nNow, let's see if we can increase G or C without increasing B beyond 21.\n\nWait, if B=21, and we have $20 left, maybe we can buy more items.\n\nBut the remaining budget after B=21 is 1200-420=780.\n\nWe have already allocated 760 to G and C, leaving $20.\n\nBut G and C are already at their maximum allowed by the constraints (G=10, C=6). So, we can't buy more without exceeding the budget.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can reduce G or C to buy more of something else.\n\nWait, for example, if we reduce G by 1, we free up $40, which can be used to buy more C.\n\nSo, G=9, which would allow C to be higher.\n\nLet's see:\n\nG=9, C=?\n\nTotal cost for G and C: 9*40 + C*60 \u2264780.\n\nSo, 360 +60C \u2264780 \u219260C \u2264420 \u2192C \u22647.\n\nBut C must be at least 21/4=5.25, so C=7.\n\nTotal cost: 360+420=780.\n\nTotal items:21+9+7=37.\n\nSame as before.\n\nAlternatively, if we reduce G by 2, to 8:\n\nG=8, C=?\n\nTotal cost:8*40=320\n\nSo, 780-320=460 for C.\n\nC=460/60\u22487.666, so C=8.\n\nBut C must be at least 5.25, so 8 is fine.\n\nTotal cost:320+480=800, which exceeds the remaining budget of 780.\n\nSo, can't do that.\n\nSo, G=9, C=7 is better.\n\nTotal items=37.\n\nSame as before.\n\nAlternatively, if we reduce C to 5, which is the minimum, then we can buy more G.\n\nBut C must be at least 5.25, so 5 is below that. So, not allowed.\n\nSo, C must be at least 6.\n\nWait, no, 21/4=5.25, so C must be at least 6 because you can't have half a cushion.\n\nSo, C=6 is the minimum.\n\nSo, if B=21, G can be up to 10, C=6.\n\nTotal items=37.\n\nAlternatively, if we set B=21, G=10, C=6.\n\nIs there a way to have B=21, but more items by adjusting G and C?\n\nNo, because G and C are already at their maximum allowed by the constraints.\n\nAlternatively, maybe B=21, G=10, C=6 is optimal.\n\nBut let's check another B value.\n\nSuppose B=20.\n\nThen, C=5, G=10.\n\nTotal cost:20*20=400\n\nG=10*40=400\n\nC=5*60=300\n\nTotal=400+400+300=1,100.\n\nTotal items=20+10+5=35.\n\nLess than 37.\n\nAlternatively, with B=20, can we have more G or C?\n\nIf we set B=20, then G can be up to 10.\n\nC must be at least 5.\n\nSo, if we set G=10, C=5.\n\nTotal items=35.\n\nAlternatively, if we reduce G to 9, we can have more C.\n\nG=9, C=?\n\nTotal cost for G and C:9*40 + C*60 \u2264780.\n\nSo, 360 +60C \u2264780 \u219260C \u2264420 \u2192C=7.\n\nTotal cost=360+420=780.\n\nTotal items=20+9+7=36.\n\nBetter than 35.\n\nSimilarly, if we set G=8, C=8.\n\nTotal cost=8*40 +8*60=320+480=800>780.\n\nToo much.\n\nSo, G=9, C=7 is better.\n\nTotal items=36.\n\nStill less than 37.\n\nSo, B=21 is better.\n\nWhat about B=19.\n\nC=5, G=9.\n\nTotal cost=19*20=380\n\nG=9*40=360\n\nC=5*60=300\n\nTotal=380+360+300=1,040.\n\nTotal items=19+9+5=33.\n\nAlternatively, with B=19, can we have more G or C?\n\nIf G=9, C=5.\n\nIf we set G=9, C=5.\n\nAlternatively, reduce G to 8, C=6.\n\nTotal cost=8*40 +6*60=320+360=680.\n\nTotal items=19+8+6=33.\n\nSame as before.\n\nAlternatively, G=10, but B=19, so G can be up to 9 (since 19/2=9.5\u21929).\n\nSo, no gain.\n\nThus, B=21 seems better.\n\nNow, let's try B=24, just to see.\n\nWait, B=24, C=6 (since 24/4=6), G=12 (since 24/2=12).\n\nTotal cost=24*20=480\n\nG=12*40=480\n\nC=6*60=360\n\nTotal=480+480+360=1,320>1200.\n\nToo much.\n\nAlternatively, reduce G or C.\n\nBut even if we reduce G to 11, C=6.\n\nTotal cost=24*20=480\n\nG=11*40=440\n\nC=6*60=360\n\nTotal=480+440+360=1,280>1200.\n\nStill too much.\n\nAlternatively, reduce C to 5, which is less than required.\n\nBut C must be at least 6, so not allowed.\n\nThus, B=24 is too much.\n\nWhat about B=21, G=10, C=6.\n\nTotal items=37.\n\nIs there a way to have more items?\n\nSuppose we reduce B to 20, but increase G and C.\n\nWait, B=20, G=10, C=5: total=35.\n\nAlternatively, B=20, G=9, C=7: total=36.\n\nStill less than 37.\n\nAlternatively, B=21, G=10, C=6:37.\n\nAlternatively, what if we set B=21, G=10, C=6, and use the remaining $20 to buy more books.\n\nWait, but B=21 already uses $420, and the remaining is $780.\n\nIf we buy more books, we'd have to adjust G and C.\n\nBut as we saw earlier, B=22 would require G=11 and C=6, which exceeds the budget.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can buy one more book, making B=22, but then G=11 and C=6.\n\nTotal cost=22*20=440\n\nG=11*40=440\n\nC=6*60=360\n\nTotal=440+440+360=1,240>1200.\n\nNo good.\n\nAlternatively, maybe buy one more"
