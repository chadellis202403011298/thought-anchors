  "question": "A local ornithologist is trying to understand the feeding patterns of hummingbirds in the city park. She observes that the hummingbirds seem to visit red flowers more frequently than flowers of other colors. She decides to test this by placing four feeders in the park: a red one, a blue one, a yellow one, and a green one. All feeders contain the same sugar solution. After one week, she counts the number of visits to each feeder:\n\nRed feeder: 152 visits\nBlue feeder: 58 visits\nYellow feeder: 89 visits\nGreen feeder: 45 visits\n\nBased on this data, the ornithologist builds a simple model: 'Hummingbirds in this park prefer red feeders, followed by yellow, then blue, and finally green.'\n\nWhat is a significant limitation of this model, and what modification to the experimental design would help address this limitation?",
  "answer": "The significant limitation of the model is that it doesn't account for potential confounding variables, particularly the location of each feeder within the park.\n\nStep 1: Identify the problem with the current model. The model simply states a preference order based on the number of visits, but doesn't consider that the feeders' positions might affect visitation rates. Hummingbirds might visit the red feeder more frequently not because of its color, but because it happens to be placed in a more favorable location (e.g., near nesting sites, away from predators, or in a less disturbed area).\n\nStep 2: Consider how this confounding variable could impact the results. If the red feeder was placed in a location that hummingbirds naturally frequent more often, the higher visit count might be due to location rather than color preference.\n\nStep 3: Propose a modification to address this limitation. The ornithologist should use a rotating design where each feeder is moved to each of the four locations for equal periods of time. For example, each feeder could spend two days at each location over an eight-day period. This would help control for location effects and provide more reliable data on color preferences.\n\nStep 4: Consider how the modified design would improve the model. By controlling for location, any persistent differences in visitation rates across colors would provide stronger evidence for actual color preferences. This would make the model more robust and scientifically valid.\n\nThis modification exemplifies a key principle in scientific model building: identifying and controlling for potential confounding variables to strengthen the validity of conclusions."
