  "question": "A traveler arrives at a fork in the road. One path leads to a village of truth-tellers who always tell the truth, and the other path leads to a village of liars who always lie. At the fork stands a single villager, but the traveler doesn't know which village the person is from. What single question can the traveler ask to determine which path leads to the village of truth-tellers?",
  "answer": "The traveler should ask: 'If I were to ask you which path leads to your village, which path would you point to?'\n\nHere's why this works:\n\n1. If the villager is a truth-teller:\n   - They would truthfully point to their own village (the truth-teller village)\n   - When asked what they would say if asked which path leads to their village, they would truthfully report that they would point to the truth-teller village\n\n2. If the villager is a liar:\n   - They would normally lie and point to the wrong path (not toward their village of liars)\n   - When asked what they would say if asked which path leads to their village, they would lie about what they would say\n   - They would normally point away from their village, but they'll lie about this and say they would point toward their village\n\nTherefore, regardless of whether the villager is a truth-teller or a liar, they will point to the path that leads to the truth-tellers' village in response to this indirect question. This approach bypasses the direct problem by using a question within a question structure, forcing even a liar to give reliable information."
