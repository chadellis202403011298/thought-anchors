  "question": "A neighborhood bookstore runs a weekly raffle where customers have an equal chance of winning one of three prizes: a $10 gift card, a $25 gift card, or a $50 gift card. If you enter this raffle once each week for 12 consecutive weeks, what is the probability that the total value of your winnings will be exactly $120? Assume each weekly drawing is independent.",
  "answer": "To solve this problem, I need to find the probability that my winnings over 12 weeks will sum to exactly $120.\n\nStep 1: Understand the random variable for a single week.\nIn any given week, I can win:\n- $10 with probability 1/3\n- $25 with probability 1/3\n- $50 with probability 1/3\n\nStep 2: Identify the ways to get a sum of $120 over 12 weeks.\nI need to find the different combinations of prizes that sum to $120. Let's denote:\n- a = number of $10 wins\n- b = number of $25 wins\n- c = number of $50 wins\n\nI need combinations where:\n- 10a + 25b + 50c = 120\n- a + b + c = 12 (total number of weeks)\n\nSolving these equations:\nFrom the second equation: a = 12 - b - c\nSubstituting into the first: 10(12 - b - c) + 25b + 50c = 120\n120 - 10b - 10c + 25b + 50c = 120\n15b + 40c = 0\n3b + 8c = 0\n\nSince b and c must be non-negative integers, and 3b = -8c, the only solution is b = c = 0, which means a = 12.\n\nThis means I must win the $10 prize all 12 weeks to get exactly $120.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the probability.\nThe probability of winning the $10 prize in a given week is 1/3.\nThe probability of winning the $10 prize for all 12 weeks is (1/3)^12.\n\nStep 4: Compute the final answer.\n(1/3)^12 = 1/531,441 \u2248 0.0000019\n\nTherefore, the probability of winning exactly $120 over 12 weeks is 1/531,441."
