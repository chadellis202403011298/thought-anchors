End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: A neighborhood bookstore runs a weekly raffle where customers have an equal chance of winning one of three prizes: a $10 gift card, a $25 gift card, or a $50 gift card. If you enter this raffle once each week for 12 consecutive weeks, what is the probability that the total value of your winnings will be exactly $120? Assume each weekly drawing is independent. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I've got this probability problem here about a neighborhood bookstore's weekly raffle. Let me try to break it down and figure out how to solve it.\n\nFirst, the problem says that each week, customers have an equal chance of winning one of three prizes: a $10 gift card, a $25 gift card, or a $50 gift card. I'm entering this raffle once each week for 12 consecutive weeks. I need to find the probability that the total value of my winnings will be exactly $120. Also, it mentions that each weekly drawing is independent, so that should help in setting up the probabilities.\n\nOkay, so let's start by understanding what's being asked. I'm entering 12 times, and each time I have a chance to win one of three prizes. The prizes are $10, $25, and $50. I need the total of all my winnings over 12 weeks to be exactly $120. So, I need to calculate the probability that the sum of these 12 winnings equals $120.\n\nSince each week's drawing is independent, the outcome of one week doesn't affect the others. That means each week, the probability of winning $10, $25, or $50 is the same, right? So, each prize has a probability of 1/3 each week.\n\nNow, to model this, I think I need to consider all possible combinations of prizes over 12 weeks that add up to $120. Then, for each of these combinations, I can calculate the probability and sum them up to get the total probability.\n\nLet me denote the number of weeks I win a $10 gift card as \\( x \\), the number of weeks I win a $25 gift card as \\( y \\), and the number of weeks I win a $50 gift card as \\( z \\). Since I'm entering 12 weeks, the sum of \\( x \\), \\( y \\), and \\( z \\) should be 12. So, \\( x + y + z = 12 \\).\n\nThe total amount of money I win would then be \\( 10x + 25y + 50z \\). We want this total to be exactly $120. So, the equation is:\n\n\\[ 10x + 25y + 50z = 120 \\]\n\nAnd we also have:\n\n\\[ x + y + z = 12 \\]\n\nI need to find all non-negative integer solutions (x, y, z) to these two equations.\n\nLet me try to simplify the first equation. I can factor out a 5:\n\n\\[ 5(2x + 5y + 10z) = 120 \\]\n\nDivide both sides by 5:\n\n\\[ 2x + 5y + 10z = 24 \\]\n\nHmm, maybe I can express this in terms of the second equation. Since \\( x = 12 - y - z \\), I can substitute that into the first equation.\n\nSo, substituting \\( x = 12 - y - z \\) into \\( 2x + 5y + 10z = 24 \\):\n\n\\[ 2(12 - y - z) + 5y + 10z = 24 \\]\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n\\[ 24 - 2y - 2z + 5y + 10z = 24 \\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n- For y: (-2y + 5y) = 3y\n- For z: (-2z + 10z) = 8z\n- Constants: 24\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[ 24 + 3y + 8z = 24 \\]\n\nSubtract 24 from both sides:\n\n\\[ 3y + 8z = 0 \\]\n\nHmm, that's interesting. So, \\( 3y + 8z = 0 \\). Since y and z are non-negative integers (they can't be negative since they represent the number of weeks), the only solution here is \\( y = 0 \\) and \\( z = 0 \\).\n\nWait, does that mean that the only way to get a total of $120 is to have y=0 and z=0? Let me check that.\n\nIf y=0 and z=0, then from the second equation \\( x + y + z = 12 \\), we get x=12.\n\nSo, if I win the $10 gift card every week for 12 weeks, the total would be 12 * $10 = $120. That makes sense.\n\nBut wait, could there be other combinations where I win some combination of $25 and $50 gift cards over the 12 weeks that also add up to $120?\n\nLet me think. Suppose I win one $25 gift card and some $50 gift cards. Let's see:\n\nIf I have one week where I win $25, that's $25. Then, the remaining 11 weeks need to add up to $95, because 120 - 25 = 95.\n\nBut 95 divided by 50 is 1.9, which isn't an integer. So, I can't have 1.9 weeks, so that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe two weeks of $50: 2*50=100. Then, 120 - 100 = 20. So, I need 20 from the remaining 10 weeks. But 20 can't be made with $10 and $25s because 20 isn't a multiple of 5 beyond 10. Wait, 20 is 2*10, but let's see.\n\nWait, if I have two $50s, that's 100, and then I need 20 more from the remaining 10 weeks. So, 20 can be made by two $10s. So, that would be x=2, y=0, z=2. Wait, but let's check the equations.\n\nWait, if I have x=2, y=0, z=2, then x + y + z = 4, which is way less than 12. So that's not possible because I have to have 12 weeks. So, that approach doesn't work because the number of weeks won would only be 4, but I need to have 12 weeks.\n\nWait, maybe I need to have more weeks. Let me try another approach.\n\nLet me think again. The total amount is $120, and each week I can win $10, $25, or $50. Let me think about how many $50s I can have.\n\nIf I have z weeks of $50, then the remaining amount would be 120 - 50z, and I have 12 - z weeks left to reach that amount with $10 and $25.\n\nSo, let's denote that:\n\nFor each possible z (number of $50s), I can compute the remaining amount and see if it can be achieved with x $10s and y $25s in (12 - z) weeks.\n\nSo, let's try z=0: Then, the remaining amount is $120, and I have 12 weeks to reach it with $10 and $25.\n\nSo, 10x + 25y = 120, with x + y =12.\n\nWait, that's the same as the original problem, but with z=0. Let me solve this.\n\nFrom x + y =12, x=12 - y.\n\nSubstitute into 10x +25y=120:\n\n10*(12 - y) +25y =120\n\n120 -10y +25y =120\n\n120 +15y =120\n\n15y=0 => y=0.\n\nSo, y=0, then x=12. So, that's the same as before: 12 weeks of $10 each.\n\nSo, z=0 gives only one solution: x=12, y=0, z=0.\n\nNow, z=1: 1 week of $50, so remaining amount is 120 -50=70, and I have 11 weeks left.\n\nSo, 10x +25y =70, with x + y=11.\n\nExpress x=11 - y.\n\nSubstitute:\n\n10*(11 - y) +25y=70\n\n110 -10y +25y=70\n\n110 +15y=70\n\n15y= -40\n\ny= -40/15= -8/3, which is negative. Not possible. So, z=1 is invalid.\n\nNext, z=2: 2 weeks of $50, so remaining amount is 120 -100=20, and 10 weeks left.\n\nSo, 10x +25y=20, with x + y=10.\n\nExpress x=10 - y.\n\nSubstitute:\n\n10*(10 - y) +25y=20\n\n100 -10y +25y=20\n\n100 +15y=20\n\n15y= -80\n\ny= -80/15= -16/3, which is negative. Not possible.\n\nz=3: 3 weeks of $50, so 150, which is more than 120, so that's already over. So, no solution for z>=1.\n\nWait, but wait, when z=2, the remaining amount is $20, which needs to be achieved in 10 weeks. But since each week I can only get $10 or $25, and $25 is more than $20, I can't get $20 by using $25s. So, I have to use only $10s, but 10 weeks * $10 = $100, which is more than $20. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, wait: 10 weeks of $10s is $100, but I only need $20. That's not possible. So, z=2 is invalid.\n\nSimilarly, z=1: I have 11 weeks to make $70. Let me see, if I use $25s, how many can I have? Let's say I have y weeks of $25, then 25y <=70, so y<=2 (since 3*25=75>70). So, y=0,1,2.\n\ny=0: x=11, total money=11*10=110, which is less than 70. Wait, no, wait: Wait, no, wait, 11 weeks of $10 is $110, but I need $70. So that's not possible. Wait, perhaps I'm confused.\n\nWait, no: If z=1, I have 11 weeks left, and I need to make $70 from those 11 weeks. So, 10x +25y=70, with x + y=11.\n\nWait, earlier I tried substituting and got y=-8/3, which is negative, so no solution. So, z=1 is impossible.\n\nSimilarly, z=2: 10 weeks to make $20. Since each week is at least $10, 10 weeks would be at least $100, which is way more than $20. So, impossible.\n\nz=3: 9 weeks to make $120 - 150= -30, which is negative. So, impossible.\n\nSo, the only possible solution is z=0, y=0, x=12.\n\nWait, but let me think again: Is there a way to have some $25s and some $50s that add up to $120 in 12 weeks?\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let's try a different approach.\n\nLet me think about how much money I need to make up beyond $10 per week. Since $10 is the smallest prize, each week I can get at least $10. So, over 12 weeks, the minimum total is 12*10=120. So, the only way to get exactly $120 is to win exactly $10 each week for all 12 weeks. Because if I win any higher prize, the total would exceed $120.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because if I win a $25 or a $50 in any week, that week's contribution is more than $10, so the total would go over $120.\n\nWait, but let me check that. Suppose I win one $25 and one $50 in two weeks, and the rest $10. So, 2 weeks of higher prizes and 10 weeks of $10.\n\nThen, total would be 2*25 + 2*50 + 10*10 = 50 + 100 + 100 = 250, which is way over 120. So, that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe if I have one $25 and 11 weeks of $10: 25 + 11*10=25+110=135>120.\n\nSimilarly, one $50 and 11 weeks of $10: 50+110=160>120.\n\nSo, any week where I don't get $10 would cause the total to go over $120. Therefore, the only way to get exactly $120 is to win $10 every week for 12 weeks.\n\nTherefore, the number of favorable outcomes is 1: winning $10 each week.\n\nThe total number of possible outcomes is 3^12, since each week there are 3 possible prizes, and each week is independent.\n\nSo, the probability is 1 / 3^12.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that there are no other combinations that could add up to $120.\n\nLet me try to see if it's possible to have some weeks with $25 and some with $50 and still have the total be $120.\n\nSuppose I have y weeks of $25 and z weeks of $50, and x weeks of $10. So, x + y + z=12, and 10x +25y +50z=120.\n\nI need to find non-negative integers x, y, z such that these equations hold.\n\nLet me try z=1: Then, 50 +10x +25y=120 =>10x +25y=70.\n\nAlso, x + y=11.\n\nSo, from x=11 - y, substitute into 10x +25y=70:\n\n10*(11 - y) +25y=70 =>110 -10y +25y=70 =>110 +15y=70 =>15y= -40 => y= -8/3, which is not possible.\n\nz=2: 100 +10x +25y=120 =>10x +25y=20.\n\nx + y=10.\n\nFrom x=10 - y, substitute:\n\n10*(10 - y) +25y=20 =>100 -10y +25y=20 =>100 +15y=20 =>15y= -80 => y= -16/3, which is not possible.\n\nz=0: Then, 10x +25y=120, and x + y=12.\n\nFrom x=12 - y, substitute:\n\n10*(12 - y) +25y=120 =>120 -10y +25y=120 =>120 +15y=120 =>15y=0 =>y=0.\n\nSo, y=0, x=12.\n\nThus, the only solution is x=12, y=0, z=0.\n\nTherefore, the only way to get exactly $120 is to win $10 each week for all 12 weeks.\n\nSo, the number of favorable outcomes is 1 (since there's only one way to win $10 each week).\n\nThe total number of possible outcomes is 3^12, since each week has 3 possibilities and there are 12 weeks.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 1 / 3^12.\n\nLet me compute 3^12 to get the denominator.\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\n3^11=177147\n\n3^12=531441\n\nSo, the probability is 1 / 531441.\n\nWait, but let me think again: Is there any other way to get $120? Maybe by having some weeks with $25 and some with $50 in a way that the total adds up to $120.\n\nWait, for example, suppose I have 4 weeks of $25 and 1 week of $50, and the rest $10.\n\nSo, 4*25 +1*50 +7*10 =100 +50 +70=220>120. So, that's over.\n\nAlternatively, 1 week of $25 and 2 weeks of $50: 25 +100=125, which is over.\n\nAlternatively, 0 weeks of $25 and 2 weeks of $50: 100, then the rest 10 weeks would need to make $20, which as before, isn't possible because 10 weeks can't make $20 with $10 and $25.\n\nWait, 10 weeks at $10 would be $100, which is more than $20. So, no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 3 weeks of $25 and 1 week of $50: 75 +50=125, which is over.\n\nWait, perhaps I can have negative weeks, but that doesn't make sense because you can't have negative weeks.\n\nSo, no, it seems like the only way is to have all 12 weeks as $10.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 1 / 3^12 = 1 / 531441.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any other combinations. Maybe I can have some weeks with $25 and some with $50 that add up to $120.\n\nLet me set up the equations again:\n\nx + y + z =12\n\n10x +25y +50z=120\n\nWe can try to find all non-negative integer solutions.\n\nLet me try to express z in terms of y.\n\nFrom the second equation:\n\n10x +25y +50z=120\n\nDivide by 5:\n\n2x +5y +10z=24\n\nFrom the first equation, x=12 - y - z.\n\nSubstitute into 2x +5y +10z=24:\n\n2*(12 - y - z) +5y +10z=24\n\n24 -2y -2z +5y +10z=24\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n( -2y +5y ) + ( -2z +10z ) +24=24\n\n3y +8z=0\n\nSo, 3y +8z=0\n\nSince y and z are non-negative integers, the only solution is y=0 and z=0.\n\nThus, x=12.\n\nTherefore, the only solution is x=12, y=0, z=0.\n\nSo, the probability is indeed 1 / 3^12.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 1 divided by 531,441.\n\nSo, the final answer is 1/531441.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the probability that the total value of winnings will be exactly $120 after entering the raffle 12 times, we analyze the possible outcomes.\n\nEach week, the probability of winning a $10, $25, or $50 gift card is 1/3. We need the sum of winnings over 12 weeks to be $120.\n\nLet \\( x \\) be the number of weeks winning a $10 gift card, \\( y \\) the number of weeks winning a $25 gift card, and \\( z \\) the number of weeks winning a $"

If you enter this raffle once each week for 12 consecutive weeks, what is the probability that the total value of your winnings will be exactly $120? Assume each weekly drawing is independent. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I've got this problem here about a raffle at a neighborhood bookstore. Let me try to understand it step by step. \n\nOkay, the raffle works like this: each week, customers have an equal chance of winning one of three prizes: a $10 gift card, a $25 gift card, or a $50 gift card. I enter this raffle once each week for 12 consecutive weeks. The question is asking for the probability that the total value of my winnings will be exactly $120. They also mention that each weekly drawing is independent.\n\nHmm, so I need to find the probability that after 12 weeks, the total amount I've won is exactly $120. Since each week's raffle is independent, the outcome of one week doesn't affect the others. That means each week, I have three possible outcomes, each with equal probability.\n\nFirst, let me figure out the probability of winning each prize each week. Since there are three prizes, each has a 1/3 chance. So, the probability of winning $10 is 1/3, $25 is 1/3, and $50 is 1/3.\n\nNow, I'm doing this 12 times, and I want the total to be exactly $120. Let me think about how to model this. It sounds like a problem that involves probability and combinatorics, maybe something with combinations or permutations. Since each week is independent, maybe I can use the multiplication rule for independent events.\n\nLet me define some variables to make this clearer. Let me denote:\n\n- \\( W_{10} \\) as the number of weeks I win a $10 gift card.\n- \\( W_{25} \\) as the number of weeks I win a $25 gift card.\n- \\( W_{50} \\) as the number of weeks I win a $50 gift card.\n\nSince I enter the raffle 12 times, the sum of these should be 12:\n\n\\( W_{10} + W_{25} + W_{50} = 12 \\)\n\nAnd the total value I win is:\n\nTotal = \\( 10W_{10} + 25W_{25} + 50W_{50} \\)\n\nAnd I want this total to be exactly $120. So:\n\n\\( 10W_{10} + 25W_{25} + 50W_{50} = 120 \\)\n\nNow, I need to find all possible non-negative integer solutions to these equations, considering that \\( W_{10} \\), \\( W_{25} \\), and \\( W_{50} \\) are non-negative integers (since you can't win a negative number of weeks).\n\nLet me try to simplify this equation. Maybe I can divide everything by 5 to make the numbers smaller:\n\nTotal = \\( 10W_{10} + 25W_{25} + 50W_{50} = 120 \\)\n\nDivide by 5:\n\n\\( 2W_{10} + 5W_{25} + 10W_{50} = 24 \\)\n\nHmm, that might be easier to work with.\n\nNow, I need to find all triples \\( (W_{10}, W_{25}, W_{50}) \\) such that \\( 2W_{10} + 5W_{25} + 10W_{50} = 24 \\), and \\( W_{10} + W_{25} + W_{50} = 12 \\).\n\nThis seems like a system of linear Diophantine equations. I remember that for two variables, we can find solutions using substitution, but with three variables, it might get a bit more complex. Maybe I can express one variable in terms of the others.\n\nLet me try to express \\( W_{10} \\) from the first equation:\n\n\\( 2W_{10} = 24 - 5W_{25} - 10W_{50} \\)\n\nSo,\n\n\\( W_{10} = (24 - 5W_{25} - 10W_{50}) / 2 \\)\n\nSince \\( W_{10} \\) must be an integer, the numerator must be even. So, \\( 24 - 5W_{25} - 10W_{50} \\) must be even.\n\nLet me note that 5W_{25} and 10W_{50} are multiples of 5. 24 is even, so subtracting multiples of 5 from it must result in an even number. Since 5 is odd, each term 5W_{25} and 10W_{50} will have different parity depending on W_{25} and W_{50}.\n\nWait, 10W_{50} is always even because 10 is even, so 10W_{50} is even regardless of W_{50}. Similarly, 5W_{25}: since 5 is odd, 5W_{25} is even if W_{25} is even, and odd if W_{25} is odd.\n\nSo, 24 (even) minus 5W_{25} (which can be even or odd) minus 10W_{50} (even) must be even.\n\nSo, 24 - 5W_{25} - 10W_{50} must be even.\n\nSince 10W_{50} is even, we can write:\n\n24 - 5W_{25} must be even.\n\nSo, 5W_{25} must have the same parity as 24, which is even. Therefore, 5W_{25} must be even.\n\nBut 5 is odd, so for 5W_{25} to be even, W_{25} must be even. So, W_{25} must be even.\n\nLet me denote W_{25} as 2k, where k is an integer.\n\nSo, W_{25} = 2k.\n\nSimilarly, I can express W_{10} as:\n\n\\( W_{10} = (24 - 5*(2k) - 10W_{50}) / 2 \\)\n= \\( (24 - 10k - 10W_{50}) / 2 \\)\n= \\( 12 - 5k - 5W_{50} \\)\n\nSo, W_{10} = 12 - 5k - 5W_{50}\n\nNow, since W_{10} must be non-negative, let's write:\n\n12 - 5k - 5W_{50} \u2265 0\n=> 5k + 5W_{50} \u2264 12\n=> k + W_{50} \u2264 12/5\n=> k + W_{50} \u2264 2.4\n\nBut k and W_{50} are non-negative integers, so the maximum value k + W_{50} can take is 2.\n\nSo, possible values of k and W_{50} are such that k + W_{50} \u2264 2.\n\nLet me list the possible combinations:\n\nCase 1: k + W_{50} = 0\nThen, k=0, W_{50}=0\n\nCase 2: k + W_{50} = 1\nPossible subcases:\n- k=0, W_{50}=1\n- k=1, W_{50}=0\n\nCase 3: k + W_{50} = 2\nPossible subcases:\n- k=0, W_{50}=2\n- k=1, W_{50}=1\n- k=2, W_{50}=0\n\nWait, but since k is W_{25}/2, and W_{25} must be \u226412 because W_{25} + W_{10} + W_{50}=12, but with k being an integer, and W_{25}=2k, k can be up to 6 because 2*6=12.\n\nBut from the earlier equation, k + W_{50} \u22642, so k can be 0,1,2.\n\nWait, let me double-check that.\n\nFrom W_{10} =12 -5k -5W_{50} \u22650\n\nSo, 12 -5(k + W_{50}) \u22650\n=> 5(k + W_{50}) \u226412\n=> k + W_{50} \u226412/5=2.4\n\nSince k and W_{50} are integers, their sum must be \u22642.\n\nSo, possible values are:\n\nk=0, W_{50}=0,1,2\n\nk=1, W_{50}=0,1\n\nk=2, W_{50}=0\n\nBecause if k=3, then W_{50} would have to be \u2264-1, which isn't possible.\n\nSo, let me list all possible (k, W_{50}) pairs:\n\n1. k=0, W_{50}=0\n2. k=0, W_{50}=1\n3. k=0, W_{50}=2\n4. k=1, W_{50}=0\n5. k=1, W_{50}=1\n6. k=2, W_{50}=0\n\nNow, for each of these, I can compute W_{10} and check if all W's are non-negative integers and satisfy the total weeks equation.\n\nLet's go through each case:\n\nCase 1: k=0, W_{50}=0\n\nThen,\n\nW_{25}=2k=0\n\nW_{10}=12 -5*0 -5*0=12\n\nNow, check if W_{10} + W_{25} + W_{50}=12+0+0=12, which is correct.\n\nTotal value: 10*12 +25*0 +50*0=120+0+0=120. So this is a valid case.\n\nCase 2: k=0, W_{50}=1\n\nThen,\n\nW_{25}=2*0=0\n\nW_{10}=12 -5*0 -5*1=12-0-5=7\n\nCheck total weeks: 7+0+1=8\u226012. Wait, that's a problem.\n\nWait, no, I think I made a mistake here. Because W_{10}=7, W_{25}=0, W_{50}=1. So total weeks=7+0+1=8, which is less than 12. That can't be, because I entered 12 times. So this case is invalid because the total weeks don't add up to 12.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that k + W_{50} \u22642, but perhaps I missed that W_{10} + W_{25} + W_{50}=12, so in this case, W_{10}=7, W_{25}=0, W_{50}=1. 7+0+1=8\u226012. So this case is not valid. Therefore, this combination is invalid.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Maybe I made a mistake in the substitution.\n\nWait, W_{10}=12 -5k -5W_{50}\n\nSo, in case 2: k=0, W_{50}=1\n\nW_{10}=12 -0 -5*1=7\n\nBut then total weeks=7+0+1=8, which is not 12. So this is invalid.\n\nSimilarly, let's check case 3:\n\nCase 3: k=0, W_{50}=2\n\nThen,\n\nW_{25}=0\n\nW_{10}=12 -0 -5*2=12-10=2\n\nTotal weeks:2+0+2=4\u226012. So invalid.\n\nCase 4: k=1, W_{50}=0\n\nW_{25}=2*1=2\n\nW_{10}=12 -5*1 -0=12-5=7\n\nTotal weeks:7+2+0=9\u226012. Invalid.\n\nCase 5: k=1, W_{50}=1\n\nW_{25}=2\n\nW_{10}=12 -5*1 -5*1=12-10=2\n\nTotal weeks:2+2+1=5\u226012. Invalid.\n\nCase 6: k=2, W_{50}=0\n\nW_{25}=4\n\nW_{10}=12 -5*2 -0=12-10=2\n\nTotal weeks:2+4+0=6\u226012. Invalid.\n\nWait, so all these cases except case 1 result in total weeks less than 12. That can't be right because I entered 12 times, so the sum of W_{10}+W_{25}+W_{50} must be 12.\n\nSo, I must have made a mistake in my approach. Maybe I should try a different method.\n\nAlternative approach: Let me think of the total value equation and the total weeks equation together.\n\nI have:\n\n1. \\( W_{10} + W_{25} + W_{50} =12 \\)\n2. \\( 10W_{10} +25W_{25} +50W_{50}=120 \\)\n\nLet me try to express this as a linear system.\n\nLet me subtract 2.5 times equation 1 from equation 2:\n\nEquation 2: \\( 10W_{10} +25W_{25} +50W_{50}=120 \\)\n\n2.5 times equation 1: \\( 2.5W_{10} + 2.5W_{25} +2.5W_{50}=30 \\)\n\nSubtracting:\n\n\\( (10W_{10} -2.5W_{10}) + (25W_{25} -2.5W_{25}) + (50W_{50} -2.5W_{50}) =120 -30 \\)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n\\( 7.5W_{10} +22.5W_{25} +47.5W_{50}=90 \\)\n\nHmm, that's not very helpful because of the decimals. Maybe a better approach is to manipulate the equations differently.\n\nLet me try to express equation 2 in terms of equation 1.\n\nFrom equation 1: \\( W_{10} + W_{25} + W_{50}=12 \\)\n\nLet me multiply equation 1 by 10:\n\n10W_{10} +10W_{25} +10W_{50}=120\n\nNow, subtract this from equation 2:\n\n(10W_{10} +25W_{25} +50W_{50}) - (10W_{10} +10W_{25} +10W_{50}) =120 -120\n\nWhich gives:\n\n15W_{25} +40W_{50}=0\n\nSo, 15W_{25} +40W_{50}=0\n\nSince W_{25} and W_{50} are non-negative integers, the only solution is W_{25}=0 and W_{50}=0.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, from this, W_{25}=0 and W_{50}=0.\n\nThen, from equation 1: W_{10}=12.\n\nSo, the only solution is W_{10}=12, W_{25}=0, W_{50}=0.\n\nBut wait, that would mean I won the $10 gift card 12 times, which seems possible, but let me check if that adds up to $120.\n\nYes, 12*10=120.\n\nBut is this the only solution?\n\nWait, but earlier when I tried the substitution method, I found that only W_{25}=0 and W_{50}=0 gives W_{10}=12, which satisfies both equations. So, perhaps that's the only solution.\n\nBut that seems a bit restrictive. Let me check again.\n\nFrom equation 2: 10W_{10} +25W_{25} +50W_{50}=120\n\nFrom equation 1: W_{10}=12 - W_{25} - W_{50}\n\nSubstitute into equation 2:\n\n10*(12 - W_{25} - W_{50}) +25W_{25} +50W_{50}=120\n\nExpanding:\n\n120 -10W_{25} -10W_{50} +25W_{25} +50W_{50}=120\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n120 + ( -10W_{25} +25W_{25}) + (-10W_{50} +50W_{50})=120\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n120 +15W_{25} +40W_{50}=120\n\nSubtract 120 from both sides:\n\n15W_{25} +40W_{50}=0\n\nWhich again gives W_{25}=0 and W_{50}=0.\n\nSo, indeed, the only solution is W_{10}=12, W_{25}=0, W_{50}=0.\n\nWait, but that seems to suggest that the only way to get exactly $120 is to win the $10 gift card 12 times. Is that possible?\n\nBecause 12 weeks * $10 = $120, and any other combination would either give less than $120 or more than $120.\n\nWait, let me check that. For example, if I won a $25 gift card once, that's $25, and then I have 11 weeks left. If I won $10 in the remaining 11 weeks, that would be 11*10 +25=115, which is less than 120. If I won $50 once, that's 50 +11*10=50+110=160, which is more than 120.\n\nSimilarly, if I won two $25 gift cards, that's 50, and then 10 weeks left. 10*10=100, total 150, which is more than 120.\n\nAlternatively, if I won one $25 and one $50, that's 75, and 10 weeks left: 10*10=100, total 175, which is way more.\n\nSo, indeed, the only way to get exactly $120 is to win the $10 gift card 12 times.\n\nTherefore, the probability is the probability of winning $10 gift card 12 times in 12 weeks.\n\nSince each week is independent, the probability of winning $10 each week is (1/3)^12.\n\nSo, the probability is (1/3)^12.\n\nCalculating that, (1/3)^12 = 1 / 531441 \u2248 0.00000188.\n\nBut let me confirm that there are no other possible combinations that could sum to $120.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed something. Let me think differently.\n\nSuppose I have W_{10}, W_{25}, W_{50} such that 10W_{10} +25W_{25} +50W_{50}=120.\n\nI can write this as 2W_{10} +5W_{25} +10W_{50}=24, as I did before.\n\nLet me try to find all non-negative integer solutions to this equation.\n\nLet me consider W_{50} first. Since 10W_{50} \u226424, W_{50} can be 0,1,2.\n\nCase 1: W_{50}=0\n\nThen, equation becomes 2W_{10} +5W_{25}=24.\n\nWe can write this as 2W_{10}=24 -5W_{25}.\n\nSo, 24 -5W_{25} must be even and non-negative.\n\nSince 5W_{25} must be \u226424 and even, W_{25} must be even because 5 is odd, so 5W_{25} is even only if W_{25} is even.\n\n"

    "solution": "Solve this problem step by step. End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: A neighborhood bookstore runs a weekly raffle where customers have an equal chance of winning one of three prizes: a $10 gift card, a $25 gift card, or a $50 gift card. If you enter this raffle once each week for 12 consecutive weeks, what is the probability that the total value of your winnings will be exactly $120? Assume each weekly drawing is independent. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out the probability that after entering this raffle 12 weeks in a row, the total value of my winnings is exactly $120. The store gives out three prizes each week: $10, $25, and $50 gift cards. Each week, each prize has an equal chance, so that means each prize has a 1/3 chance of being won each week.\n\nFirst, I should understand what the problem is asking. I'm going to enter the raffle once every week for 12 weeks. Each time, I can win one of the three prizes, and I want the total of all these prizes over 12 weeks to be exactly $120. I need to find the probability of that happening.\n\nHmm, okay. So, each week, I can win $10, $25, or $50. So, over 12 weeks, the total winnings would be the sum of 12 such amounts. I need the sum to be exactly $120. So, I need to find all the possible combinations of 10s, 25s, and 50s that add up to 120 over 12 weeks, and then calculate the probability based on how many such combinations there are and the probability of each combination occurring.\n\nWait, but since each week's outcome is independent, the total probability is the sum of the probabilities of each possible combination that sums to 120. So, I need to find all the sequences of 12 prizes (each being 10, 25, or 50) that add up to 120, and then add up the probabilities of each of these sequences.\n\nBut that seems like a lot of work. Maybe there's a smarter way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model this as a generating function problem. Generating functions can help find the number of ways to achieve a certain total. Let me think about that.\n\nEach week, the possible winnings can be represented by a polynomial where the exponent represents the dollar amount. Since each week I can get $10, $25, or $50, the generating function for one week is:\n\nG(x) = x^10 + x^25 + x^50\n\nSince each week is independent, the generating function for 12 weeks would be G(x)^12. So, the coefficient of x^120 in G(x)^12 would give the number of ways to win exactly $120 over 12 weeks. Then, the probability would be that coefficient multiplied by (1/3)^12, since each prize has a 1/3 chance each week.\n\nBut wait, how do I compute G(x)^12? That might be complicated, but maybe I can find a smarter way or look for a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of dynamic programming. Let me consider the possible total winnings after each week and build up the solution week by week.\n\nLet's define DP[i][j] as the number of ways to have a total of j dollars after i weeks. Our goal is DP[12][120].\n\nThe base case is DP[0][0] = 1, since there's one way to have 0 dollars after 0 weeks.\n\nFor each week from 1 to 12, and for each possible total j, we can compute DP[i][j] by adding the number of ways to reach j - 10, j - 25, and j - 50 from the previous week, provided those amounts are non-negative.\n\nBut doing this manually for 12 weeks and up to $120 would be time-consuming, but maybe manageable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a mathematical approach. Let's think about it.\n\nEach week, I can win 10, 25, or 50. Let me consider the total winnings over 12 weeks as the sum of 12 variables, each of which can be 10, 25, or 50. Let me denote the number of weeks I won $10 as x, the number of weeks I won $25 as y, and the number of weeks I won $50 as z. Then, x + y + z = 12, and the total winnings would be 10x + 25y + 50z = 120.\n\nSo, I need to find all non-negative integer solutions (x, y, z) to the system:\n\nx + y + z = 12\n\n10x + 25y + 50z = 120\n\nThen, for each solution, the number of sequences is 12! / (x! y! z!), and the probability is [12! / (x! y! z!)] * (1/3)^12.\n\nSo, the total probability would be the sum over all valid (x, y, z) of [12! / (x! y! z!)] * (1/3)^12.\n\nTherefore, my task reduces to finding all possible (x, y, z) that satisfy the above equations.\n\nLet me try to find all possible (x, y, z):\n\nFrom the first equation, z = 12 - x - y.\n\nSubstituting into the second equation:\n\n10x + 25y + 50(12 - x - y) = 120\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n10x + 25y + 600 - 50x - 50y = 120\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(10x - 50x) + (25y - 50y) + 600 = 120\n\n-40x -25y + 600 = 120\n\nNow, subtract 600 from both sides:\n\n-40x -25y = -480\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\n40x + 25y = 480\n\nSimplify the equation by dividing both sides by 5:\n\n8x + 5y = 96\n\nSo, 8x + 5y = 96, with x and y non-negative integers.\n\nI need to find all (x, y) such that 8x + 5y = 96.\n\nLet me solve for y in terms of x:\n\n5y = 96 - 8x\n\ny = (96 - 8x)/5\n\nSince y must be an integer, (96 - 8x) must be divisible by 5.\n\nSo, 96 - 8x \u2261 0 mod 5\n\nCompute 96 mod 5: 96 \u00f75=19*5=95, remainder 1. So, 96 \u22611 mod5\n\nSimilarly, 8x mod5: 8\u22613 mod5, so 8x \u22613x mod5\n\nSo, 1 -3x \u22610 mod5 => 3x \u22611 mod5\n\nWe need to solve 3x \u22611 mod5.\n\nMultiplicative inverse of 3 mod5 is 2, since 3*2=6\u22611 mod5.\n\nSo, x \u22612*1=2 mod5.\n\nThus, x \u22612 mod5.\n\nSo, x can be written as x=5k +2, where k is a non-negative integer.\n\nNow, since x must be such that y=(96 -8x)/5 is non-negative, let's find the possible values of x.\n\nx=5k +2\n\nSo, plug into y:\n\ny=(96 -8*(5k +2))/5 = (96 -40k -16)/5 = (80 -40k)/5=16 -8k\n\nSince y must be \u22650, 16 -8k \u22650 => 8k \u226416 => k \u22642.\n\nAlso, since x=5k +2 must be \u22650, and since k is non-negative, k can be 0,1,2.\n\nSo, k=0:\n\nx=2, y=16\n\nCheck: 8*2 +5*16=16 +80=96. Yes.\n\nk=1:\n\nx=7, y=8\n\nCheck:8*7 +5*8=56+40=96. Yes.\n\nk=2:\n\nx=12, y=0\n\nCheck:8*12 +5*0=96+0=96. Yes.\n\nk=3 would give x=17, but y=16-24=-8, which is negative, so invalid.\n\nThus, the possible solutions are:\n\n(2,16, z=12 -2 -16= -6) Wait, that can't be. Wait, z=12 -x -y.\n\nWait, x + y + z=12, so z=12 -x -y.\n\nWait, when k=0: x=2, y=16, so z=12 -2 -16= -6. That's negative, which is impossible. So, that's invalid.\n\nWait, that's a problem. So, my earlier approach has a mistake.\n\nWait, when k=0, x=2, y=16. But x + y =18, which is more than 12. So, z would be negative, which is impossible. So, that solution is invalid.\n\nSimilarly, k=1: x=7, y=8. x + y=15, which is more than 12. z=12 -15= -3. Again, negative. Invalid.\n\nk=2: x=12, y=0. x + y=12, so z=0. That's valid.\n\nWait, so only k=2 gives a valid solution where z=0.\n\nBut that seems odd. Let me check my earlier steps.\n\nWait, when I substituted z=12 -x -y into the total winnings equation, I got 8x +5y=96.\n\nBut if x + y + z=12, then z=12 -x -y, so when x and y are such that x + y \u226412, z is non-negative.\n\nBut in the solutions I found, for k=0 and k=1, x + y exceeds 12, making z negative, which is invalid. So, only k=2 gives a valid solution where x=12, y=0, z=0.\n\nWait, that seems to suggest that the only way to get exactly $120 over 12 weeks is to win $50 twelve times, but that can't be right because 12*$50=600, which is way more than 120.\n\nWait, I must have made a mistake in my equations.\n\nWait, let me go back.\n\nTotal winnings:10x +25y +50z=120\n\nAnd x + y + z=12\n\nSo, substituting z=12 -x -y into the total winnings:\n\n10x +25y +50*(12 -x -y)=120\n\nCompute that:\n\n10x +25y +600 -50x -50y=120\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(10x -50x) + (25y -50y) +600=120\n\n-40x -25y +600=120\n\nThen, subtract 600:\n\n-40x -25y= -480\n\nMultiply by -1:\n\n40x +25y=480\n\nDivide by 5:\n\n8x +5y=96\n\nSo that part is correct.\n\nThen, solving 8x +5y=96, with x and y non-negative integers.\n\nEarlier, I tried solving for y in terms of x:\n\ny=(96 -8x)/5\n\nWhich requires that 96 -8x is divisible by 5.\n\nSo, 96 mod5=1, 8x mod5=3x mod5.\n\nSo, 1 -3x \u22610 mod5 => 3x \u22611 mod5.\n\nThe inverse of 3 mod5 is 2, since 3*2=6\u22611 mod5.\n\nThus, x\u22612 mod5.\n\nSo, x=5k +2, where k is a non-negative integer.\n\nThen, y=(96 -8*(5k +2))/5=(96 -40k -16)/5=(80 -40k)/5=16 -8k.\n\nSo, y=16 -8k.\n\nNow, since y must be \u22650, 16 -8k \u22650 => k \u22642.\n\nSimilarly, x=5k +2 must be \u22650, which is true for k\u22650.\n\nSo, possible k=0,1,2.\n\nFor k=0:\n\nx=2, y=16\n\nBut x + y=18 >12, so z=12 -18= -6. Invalid.\n\nFor k=1:\n\nx=7, y=8\n\nx + y=15>12, z=12 -15= -3. Invalid.\n\nFor k=2:\n\nx=12, y=0\n\nx + y=12, z=0. Valid.\n\nWait, so the only valid solution is x=12, y=0, z=0.\n\nBut that would mean I won $50 twelve times, which gives total winnings of 12*50=600, which is way more than 120. That doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, I must have messed up the problem somewhere.\n\nWait, the total winnings are 10x +25y +50z=120, and x + y + z=12.\n\nSo, if x=12, y=0, z=0, then total winnings would be 12*10=120. That works.\n\nWait, but earlier substitution gave x=12, y=0, z=0.\n\nWait, let me check that again.\n\nWhen k=2:\n\nx=12, y=0.\n\nThen, z=12 -12 -0=0.\n\nSo, total winnings:12*10 +0*25 +0*50=120.\n\nYes, that works.\n\nSimilarly, for k=1:\n\nx=7, y=8.\n\nz=12 -7 -8= -3. Invalid.\n\nk=0: x=2, y=16, z= -6. Invalid.\n\nSo, the only valid solution is x=12, y=0, z=0.\n\nWait, but that would mean I won the $10 prize 12 times, which adds up to $120, which is exactly what I need.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that each week, the prizes are $10, $25, or $50. So, it's possible that I could win the $10 prize multiple times, but is there any other way to get exactly $120 over 12 weeks?\n\nWait, let me think. Maybe I can have some combination of $10, $25, and $50 that adds up to 120 over 12 weeks.\n\nFor example, suppose I won one $50, one $25, and the rest $10s.\n\nLet me check:\n\n50 +25 +10x=120\n\nSo, 75 +10x=120 =>10x=45 =>x=4.5, which is not an integer. So, that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, two $25s and the rest $10s:\n\n25*2 +10x=120 =>50 +10x=120 =>10x=70 =>x=7.\n\nSo, x=7, y=2, z=3? Wait, no, wait. Wait, x + y + z=12.\n\nWait, if y=2, then z=12 -x -y=12 -7 -2=3.\n\nSo, total winnings:7*10 +2*25 +3*50=70 +50 +150=270, which is more than 120.\n\nWait, that's not correct.\n\nWait, no, I think I'm confusing variables.\n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\nLet me denote:\n\nx = number of weeks with $10\n\ny = number of weeks with $25\n\nz = number of weeks with $50\n\nSo, x + y + z=12\n\nTotal winnings:10x +25y +50z=120\n\nWe need to find all non-negative integers x,y,z that satisfy these equations.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nLet me suppose that I won some number of $50s, say z.\n\nEach $50 contributes 50 to the total, so the remaining amount after accounting for z would be 120 -50z.\n\nThis remaining amount must come from x and y, where x + y=12 -z.\n\nAnd the remaining amount is 10x +25y=120 -50z.\n\nSo, for each possible z, I can check if 120 -50z is divisible by 5 and whether the equation 10x +25y=120 -50z can be solved with x + y=12 -z.\n\nLet me try z=0:\n\nThen, 10x +25y=120, and x + y=12.\n\nDivide the first equation by 5: 2x +5y=24.\n\nSo, 2x +5y=24, and x + y=12.\n\nSubtract the second equation from the first: (2x +5y) - (x + y)=24 -12 =>x +4y=12.\n\nSo, x=12 -4y.\n\nSince x \u22650, 12 -4y \u22650 => y \u22643.\n\nAlso, y must be an integer \u22650.\n\nSo, possible y=0,1,2,3.\n\nFor each y:\n\ny=0: x=12. So, z=0, x=12, y=0. That works.\n\ny=1: x=12 -4=8. So, x=8, y=1, z=0.\n\nCheck total winnings:8*10 +1*25 +0*50=80 +25=105\u2260120. Wait, that's not 120. So, that's invalid.\n\nWait, but according to the equations, it should add up to 120. Wait, no, because when z=0, the total winnings should be 10x +25y=120.\n\nWait, for y=1, x=8:\n\n10*8 +25*1=80 +25=105\u2260120. So, that's not a solution. So, this approach is not working.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the substitution.\n\nWait, when z=0, the total winnings equation is 10x +25y=120, and x + y=12.\n\nSo, from x + y=12, x=12 -y.\n\nSubstitute into 10x +25y=120:\n\n10*(12 -y) +25y=120\n\n120 -10y +25y=120\n\n120 +15y=120\n\n15y=0 => y=0.\n\nThus, y=0, x=12.\n\nSo, only solution when z=0 is x=12, y=0, z=0.\n\nSimilarly, try z=1:\n\nThen, 50*1=50, so remaining=120 -50=70.\n\nAnd x + y=12 -1=11.\n\nSo, 10x +25y=70.\n\nDivide by 5: 2x +5y=14.\n\nAnd x + y=11.\n\nSubtract: (2x +5y) - (x + y)=14 -11 =>x +4y=3.\n\nSo, x=3 -4y.\n\nSince x \u22650, 3 -4y \u22650 => y \u22640.75, so y=0.\n\nThus, y=0, x=3.\n\nCheck: x=3, y=0, z=1.\n\nTotal winnings:3*10 +0*25 +1*50=30 +0 +50"

End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: A neighborhood bookstore runs a weekly raffle where customers have an equal chance of winning one of three prizes: a $10 gift card, a $25 gift card, or a $50 gift card. If you enter this raffle once each week for 12 consecutive weeks, what is the probability that the total value of your winnings will be exactly $120? Assume each weekly drawing is independent. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this problem about a raffle at a neighborhood bookstore. They run a weekly raffle where customers have an equal chance of winning one of three prizes: a $10 gift card, a $25 gift card, or a $50 gift card. I'm entering this raffle once each week for 12 consecutive weeks. I need to find the probability that the total value of my winnings will be exactly $120. Each weekly drawing is independent.\n\nOkay, first, I should understand the problem. There are three prizes each week: $10, $25, and $50. Each has an equal chance, so each prize has a probability of 1/3. I'm entering 12 times, so I have 12 independent opportunities to win one of these prizes.\n\nI need the total winnings to be exactly $120. So, I need to figure out all the possible combinations of these prizes over 12 weeks that add up to $120 and then calculate the probability for each combination and sum them up.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. This seems like a problem that involves combinations with repetition because each week I can win any of the three prizes, and the order might matter in terms of the total amount.\n\nWait, no, actually, the order might not matter because each week is independent, so the total is just the sum of each individual prize. Hmm, but I need the sum to be exactly $120.\n\nSo, each week I can get $10, $25, or $50. Over 12 weeks, the minimum I can win is 12*$10 = $120, and the maximum is 12*$50 = $600. So, $120 is actually the minimum possible total. So, the only way to get exactly $120 is if I win the $10 prize every week for 12 weeks.\n\nWait, is that the case? Let me check.\n\nIf I win $10 each week, that's 12*$10 = $120. If I win any higher prize in any week, the total would exceed $120, right? Because even if I replace one $10 with a $25, the total becomes $125, which is more than $120. Similarly, replacing with a $50 would make it even higher.\n\nTherefore, the only way to have a total of exactly $120 is to win the $10 prize every single week for all 12 weeks.\n\nSo, the probability is the probability of winning $10 each week for 12 weeks.\n\nSince each week is independent, the probability is (1/3)^12.\n\nWait, let me verify that. Each week, the chance of winning $10 is 1/3, and since each week is independent, we multiply the probabilities.\n\nYes, so (1/3) multiplied by itself 12 times, which is (1/3)^12.\n\nLet me compute that. 3^12 is... Hmm, 3^1 is 3, 3^2 is 9, 3^3 is 27, 3^4 is 81, 3^5 is 243, 3^6 is 729, 3^7 is 2187, 3^8 is 6561, 3^9 is 19683, 3^10 is 59049, 3^11 is 177147, 3^12 is 531441.\n\nSo, (1/3)^12 is 1/531441.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 1/531441.\n\nWait, that seems very low, but considering that the only way to get exactly $120 is to win $10 each week, and each week has a 1/3 chance, over 12 weeks, it's (1/3)^12.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as the number of ways to get exactly $120 divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nThe total number of possible outcomes is 3^12, since each week has 3 possibilities, and there are 12 weeks.\n\nThe number of favorable outcomes is the number of ways to have all 12 prizes be $10. There's only 1 such outcome, because you have to win $10 each week.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 1 / 3^12, which is 1 / 531441.\n\nSo, that seems to be the answer. But let me double-check if there's any other way to get exactly $120.\n\nSuppose I try to mix in a $25 or a $50, would that ever result in $120?\n\nLet's see. Suppose I have 11 weeks of $10 and one week of $25. Then the total would be 11*10 + 25 = 110 +25= $135, which is more than $120.\n\nSimilarly, if I have 11 weeks of $10 and one week of $50, that's 110 +50= $160, which is way over.\n\nWhat if I have 10 weeks of $10 and two weeks of $25? That would be 10*10 + 2*25=100+50= $150.\n\nStill over.\n\nWhat if I have 12 weeks of $10, that's 120, which is exactly what we need.\n\nAlternatively, is there any combination where the total is $120, but not all $10s?\n\nLet me think. Suppose I have 11 weeks of $10 and one week of $0. But there's no $0 prize, so that's impossible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe negative weeks? No, that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, can I have fractions of weeks? No, because each week is an independent event, so each week you have to win one of the three prizes.\n\nTherefore, the only way to reach exactly $120 is to have all 12 weeks be $10.\n\nSo, the probability is indeed (1/3)^12, which is 1/531441.\n\nSo, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, just to be thorough, let me consider another approach. Maybe using generating functions.\n\nThe generating function for each week is f(x) = x^10 + x^25 + x^50, since each week, the possible winnings are 10,25,50.\n\nThen, for 12 weeks, the generating function would be [f(x)]^12 = (x^10 + x^25 + x^50)^12.\n\nWe need the coefficient of x^120 in this expansion, multiplied by (1/3)^12.\n\nSo, let's find the coefficient of x^120 in (x^10 + x^25 + x^50)^12.\n\nThis coefficient would represent the number of ways to get a total of 120 dollars over 12 weeks.\n\nBut as I thought earlier, the only way to get 120 is by getting 12 weeks of $10, which is x^10^12 = x^120.\n\nSo, the coefficient is 1, because it's only one way: all 12 prizes are $10.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 1 * (1/3)^12 = 1/531441.\n\nSo, that confirms my earlier conclusion.\n\nAlternatively, I can think in terms of multinomial coefficients, but since all the prizes are the same each week, and we're looking for a specific combination, the multinomial approach might complicate things, but let's see.\n\nThe multinomial distribution gives the probability of having a certain number of each outcome. In this case, each week, the prize can be 10,25,50. So, over 12 weeks, let me define variables:\n\nLet a = number of weeks with $10,\n\nb = number of weeks with $25,\n\nc = number of weeks with $50.\n\nWe have a + b + c =12.\n\nAnd the total winnings would be 10a +25b +50c =120.\n\nWe need to find all non-negative integer solutions (a,b,c) to these equations.\n\nFrom the first equation, c=12 -a -b.\n\nSubstitute into the second equation:\n\n10a +25b +50(12 -a -b)=120\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n10a +25b +600 -50a -50b =120\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(10a -50a) + (25b -50b) +600 =120\n\n-40a -25b +600 =120\n\nNow, subtract 600 from both sides:\n\n-40a -25b = -480\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\n40a +25b =480\n\nWe can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by 5:\n\n8a +5b =96\n\nNow, we need to find non-negative integers a and b such that 8a +5b=96, and a +b <=12 because c=12 -a -b must be non-negative.\n\nSo, let's solve for b:\n\n5b=96 -8a\n\nb=(96 -8a)/5\n\nSince b must be an integer, 96 -8a must be divisible by 5.\n\nSo, 96 -8a \u22610 mod5\n\nCompute 96 mod5: 96 /5=19*5=95, so 96\u22611 mod5\n\nSimilarly, 8a mod5: 8\u22613 mod5, so 8a\u22613a mod5\n\nSo, 1 -3a \u22610 mod5\n\nWhich implies:\n\n-3a \u2261-1 mod5 => 3a \u22611 mod5\n\nMultiplicative inverse of 3 mod5 is 2, because 3*2=6\u22611 mod5.\n\nSo, multiply both sides by 2:\n\na\u22612 mod5\n\nTherefore, a=5k +2, where k is a non-negative integer.\n\nNow, since a +b <=12, and a=5k+2, let's find possible k.\n\nStart with k=0:\n\na=2\n\nThen, b=(96 -8*2)/5=(96-16)/5=80/5=16\n\nBut a +b=2 +16=18>12, which is not allowed.\n\nNext, k=1:\n\na=5*1+2=7\n\nb=(96 -8*7)/5=(96-56)/5=40/5=8\n\na +b=7+8=15>12, still too big.\n\nk=2:\n\na=5*2+2=12\n\nb=(96 -8*12)/5=(96-96)/5=0/5=0\n\na +b=12+0=12<=12, which is allowed.\n\nk=3:\n\na=5*3+2=17, which is already more than 12, so invalid.\n\nSo, the only possible value is k=2, leading to a=12, b=0, c=0.\n\nTherefore, the only solution is a=12, b=0, c=0.\n\nSo, the number of ways is the multinomial coefficient:\n\n12! / (12! 0! 0!) =1.\n\nTherefore, there is only one way to achieve this, which is winning $10 each week.\n\nHence, the probability is 1 /3^12=1/531441.\n\nSo, that's consistent with my earlier conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 1/531441.\n</think>\n\nThe only way to win exactly $120 over 12 weeks is to win the $10 prize each week. The probability of this happening is (1/3)^12, which equals 1/531,441.\n\nDONE."

If you enter this raffle once each week for 12 consecutive weeks, what is the probability that the total value of your winnings will be exactly $120? Assume each weekly drawing is independent. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this probability problem to solve, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to understand the problem first.\n\nThe problem says that a neighborhood bookstore runs a weekly raffle where customers have an equal chance of winning one of three prizes: a $10 gift card, a $25 gift card, or a $50 gift card. I enter this raffle once each week for 12 consecutive weeks. I need to find the probability that the total value of my winnings will be exactly $120. Each weekly drawing is independent.\n\nHmm, okay. So, each week, I have a 1/3 chance of winning $10, a 1/3 chance of winning $25, and a 1/3 chance of winning $50. I do this for 12 weeks, and I want the total winnings to add up exactly to $120.\n\nFirst, let me think about what this means. I'm looking for the probability that, over 12 weeks, the sum of the gift cards I win is $120. Since each week's outcome is independent, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nWait, but calculating this directly might be complicated because there are a lot of possibilities. Maybe I can model this as a problem of finding the number of ways to get exactly $120 over 12 weeks, considering the different prize values.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- Let \\( x \\) be the number of weeks I win a $10 gift card.\n- Let \\( y \\) be the number of weeks I win a $25 gift card.\n- Let \\( z \\) be the number of weeks I win a $50 gift card.\n\nSince I enter the raffle once each week for 12 weeks, the total number of weeks is 12. So, I have:\n\n\\( x + y + z = 12 \\).\n\nAnd the total value of the winnings is:\n\n\\( 10x + 25y + 50z = 120 \\).\n\nI need to find the number of non-negative integer solutions (x, y, z) to these equations.\n\nOkay, so I have two equations:\n\n1. \\( x + y + z = 12 \\)\n2. \\( 10x + 25y + 50z = 120 \\)\n\nI can try to solve these equations to find possible values of x, y, z.\n\nLet me simplify the second equation. Maybe I can divide everything by 5 to make it easier.\n\nDividing equation 2 by 5:\n\n\\( 2x + 5y + 10z = 24 \\).\n\nNow, I have:\n\n1. \\( x + y + z = 12 \\)\n2. \\( 2x + 5y + 10z = 24 \\)\n\nHmm, maybe I can express one variable in terms of the others using equation 1 and substitute into equation 2.\n\nLet me solve equation 1 for x:\n\n\\( x = 12 - y - z \\).\n\nNow, substitute x into equation 2:\n\n\\( 2(12 - y - z) + 5y + 10z = 24 \\)\n\nLet me expand this:\n\n\\( 24 - 2y - 2z + 5y + 10z = 24 \\)\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n24 + (5y - 2y) + (10z - 2z) = 24\n\nSo:\n\n24 + 3y + 8z = 24\n\nSubtract 24 from both sides:\n\n3y + 8z = 0\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, 3y + 8z = 0.\n\nBut y and z are non-negative integers because they represent the number of times I won each prize.\n\nThe only solution to 3y + 8z = 0 is y = 0 and z = 0.\n\nSo, from this, y = 0 and z = 0.\n\nThen, from equation 1, x = 12 - y - z = 12 - 0 - 0 = 12.\n\nSo, the only solution is x = 12, y = 0, z = 0.\n\nThat means I won the $10 gift card every week for 12 weeks, and didn't win any $25 or $50 gift cards.\n\nWait, but let me check if this makes sense. If I won $10 twelve times, the total would be 12 * 10 = $120, which matches the desired total.\n\nIs this the only possible way? Let me think.\n\nSuppose I try to see if there are other solutions. Let's go back to 3y + 8z = 0.\n\nSince y and z are non-negative integers, the only solution is y=0 and z=0.\n\nBecause 8z must be zero, so z=0, and then 3y=0, so y=0.\n\nTherefore, the only possible way is to have y=0 and z=0, leading to x=12.\n\nSo, the number of favorable outcomes is the number of ways to have x=12, y=0, z=0.\n\nBut wait, in this case, it's just one specific outcome: winning $10 twelve times.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a possibility of having other combinations?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in simplifying. Let me double-check the equations.\n\nOriginal equations:\n\n1. \\( x + y + z = 12 \\)\n2. \\( 10x + 25y + 50z = 120 \\)\n\nI divided equation 2 by 5:\n\n\\( 2x + 5y + 10z = 24 \\)\n\nThen, substituted x = 12 - y - z into equation 2:\n\n\\( 2*(12 - y - z) + 5y + 10z = 24 \\)\n\nWhich becomes:\n\n24 - 2y - 2z + 5y + 10z = 24\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n24 + 3y + 8z = 24\n\nSo, 3y + 8z = 0.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the only solution is y=0 and z=0.\n\nTherefore, the only way to get exactly $120 is to win $10 twelve times.\n\nTherefore, the number of favorable outcomes is 1 (since all 12 weeks must be $10).\n\nNow, the total number of possible outcomes is the number of ways to win over 12 weeks, considering each week's prize.\n\nEach week, there are 3 possible outcomes, and since each week is independent, the total number of possible outcomes is \\( 3^{12} \\).\n\nSo, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nNumber of favorable outcomes: 1 (since only one way to win $10 twelve times).\n\nTotal number of possible outcomes: \\( 3^{12} \\).\n\nSo, the probability is \\( \\frac{1}{3^{12}} \\).\n\nWait, but let me check if I didn't miss any other solutions. Maybe I can think differently.\n\nSuppose I try to find all possible triples (x, y, z) such that:\n\nx + y + z = 12\n\nand\n\n10x + 25y + 50z = 120\n\nLet me see if there are other solutions.\n\nLet me try to express the equations again.\n\nFrom the first equation: x = 12 - y - z.\n\nSubstitute into the second equation:\n\n10*(12 - y - z) + 25y + 50z = 120\n\nCalculate:\n\n120 - 10y - 10z + 25y + 50z = 120\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n120 + 15y + 40z = 120\n\nSubtract 120:\n\n15y + 40z = 0\n\nAgain, 15y + 40z = 0.\n\nSince y and z are non-negative integers, the only solution is y=0 and z=0.\n\nSo, x=12.\n\nTherefore, the only solution is x=12, y=0, z=0.\n\nSo, yes, the probability is 1 divided by 3^12.\n\nLet me compute 3^12 to get the exact probability.\n\n3^1 = 3\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n3^3 = 27\n\n3^4 = 81\n\n3^5 = 243\n\n3^6 = 729\n\n3^7 = 2187\n\n3^8 = 6561\n\n3^9 = 19683\n\n3^10 = 59049\n\n3^11 = 177147\n\n3^12 = 531441\n\nSo, 3^12 is 531,441.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 1/531,441.\n\nWait, but that seems very low, but considering the high number of possible outcomes, it makes sense.\n\nBut let me think again: is there another way to reach $120?\n\nSuppose, for example, that I won a $50 gift card once. Let's see:\n\nIf I won a $50 gift card once, then the remaining 11 weeks need to sum up to 120 - 50 = 70.\n\nSo, 10x +25y +50z =70, with x + y + z =11.\n\nLet me see if this is possible.\n\nAgain, let me express x=11 - y - z.\n\nSubstitute into the total value equation:\n\n10*(11 - y - z) +25y +50z =70\n\nCalculate:\n\n110 -10y -10z +25y +50z =70\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n110 +15y +40z =70\n\nSubtract 110:\n\n15y +40z = -40\n\nThis is impossible because y and z are non-negative, so 15y +40z cannot be negative. Therefore, no solution in this case.\n\nSimilarly, if I try to win a $25 gift card once, then the remaining 11 weeks need to sum up to 120 -25=95.\n\nSo, 10x +25y +50z=95, with x+y+z=11.\n\nExpress x=11 - y - z.\n\nSubstitute:\n\n10*(11 - y - z) +25y +50z=95\n\nCalculate:\n\n110 -10y -10z +25y +50z=95\n\nCombine:\n\n110 +15y +40z=95\n\nSubtract 110:\n\n15y +40z= -15\n\nAgain, impossible because left side is non-negative and right side is negative.\n\nSimilarly, if I try to win a $50 gift card twice, then remaining 10 weeks need to sum to 120 -100=20.\n\nSo, 10x +25y +50z=20, with x+y+z=10.\n\nExpress x=10 - y - z.\n\nSubstitute:\n\n10*(10 - y - z) +25y +50z=20\n\nCalculate:\n\n100 -10y -10z +25y +50z=20\n\nCombine:\n\n100 +15y +40z=20\n\nSubtract 100:\n\n15y +40z= -80\n\nImpossible again.\n\nSimilarly, if I try to win a $25 gift card twice, then the remaining 10 weeks need to sum to 120 -50=70.\n\nWait, no, 25*2=50, so 120-50=70.\n\nWait, no, wait: 25*2=50, so 120 -50=70.\n\nWait, that's the same as earlier. So, 10x +25y +50z=70, with x+y+z=10.\n\nAgain, x=10 - y - z.\n\nSubstitute:\n\n10*(10 - y - z) +25y +50z=70\n\nCalculate:\n\n100 -10y -10z +25y +50z=70\n\nCombine:\n\n100 +15y +40z=70\n\nSubtract 100:\n\n15y +40z= -30\n\nImpossible.\n\nSimilarly, if I try to win a $50 gift card three times, then the remaining 9 weeks need to sum to 120 -150= -30, which is impossible.\n\nSo, in all cases where I win a $25 or $50 gift card, I end up with a negative total, which is impossible. Therefore, the only possible way is to win the $10 gift card every week.\n\nTherefore, the number of favorable outcomes is 1, and the total number of possible outcomes is 3^12=531,441.\n\nHence, the probability is 1/531,441.\n\nWait, but let me think again: is there another way to reach exactly $120?\n\nSuppose I won a $25 gift card once and a $50 gift card once. Then, the total from these two weeks is 25 +50=75. Then, the remaining 10 weeks need to sum to 120 -75=45.\n\nSo, 10x +25y +50z=45, with x+y+z=10.\n\nLet me see if this is possible.\n\nExpress x=10 - y - z.\n\nSubstitute:\n\n10*(10 - y - z) +25y +50z=45\n\nCalculate:\n\n100 -10y -10z +25y +50z=45\n\nCombine:\n\n100 +15y +40z=45\n\nSubtract 100:\n\n15y +40z= -55\n\nImpossible, as before.\n\nSimilarly, if I try to win a $50 gift card once and two $25 gift cards: total from these is 50 +25 +25=100. Remaining 9 weeks need to sum to 20.\n\nSo, 10x +25y +50z=20, with x+y+z=9.\n\nExpress x=9 - y - z.\n\nSubstitute:\n\n10*(9 - y - z) +25y +50z=20\n\nCalculate:\n\n90 -10y -10z +25y +50z=20\n\nCombine:\n\n90 +15y +40z=20\n\nSubtract 90:\n\n15y +40z= -70\n\nImpossible.\n\nTherefore, any inclusion of a $25 or $50 gift card leads to a negative required sum, which is impossible. Hence, the only solution is to win $10 twelve times.\n\nTherefore, the probability is indeed 1 divided by 3^12, which is 1/531,441.\n\nSo, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe probability is 1 divided by 3 raised to the power of 12, which is 1/531,441.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Define Variables:**\n   Let \\( x \\) = number of weeks winning $10,\n   \\( y \\) = number of weeks winning $25,\n   \\( z \\) = number of weeks winning $50.\n\n2. **Equations:**\n   - Total weeks: \\( x + y + z = 12 \\)\n   - Total winnings: \\( 10x + 25y + 50z = 120 \\)\n\n3. **Simplify the Winnings Equation:**\n   Divide by 5: \\( 2x + 5y + 10z = 24 \\)\n\n4. **Express \\( x \\) in Terms of \\( y \\) and \\( z \\):**\n   From \\( x + y + z = 12 \\), we get \\( x = 12 - y - z \\).\n\n5. **Substitute \\( x \\) into the Simplified Winnings Equation:**\n   \\( 2(12 - y - z) + 5y + 10z = 24 \\)\n   Simplify: \\( 24 + 3y + 8z = 24 \\)\n   Thus, \\( 3y + 8z = 0 \\)\n\n6. **Solve for \\( y \\) and \\( z \\):**\n   The only non-negative integer solution is \\( y = 0 \\) and \\( z = 0 \\).\n\n7. **Find \\( x \\):**\n   \\( x = 12 - 0 - 0 = 12 \\)\n\n8. **Calculate the Number of Favorable Outcomes:**\n   Only one way: winning $10 each week for 12 weeks.\n\n9. **Total Possible Outcomes:**\n   Each week has 3 outcomes, so \\( 3^{12} = 531,441 \\).\n\n10. **Probability:**\n    \\( \\frac{1}{531,441} \\)\n\n**Answer:** The probability is \\( \\frac{1}{531441} \\).\n\nDONE."

End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: A neighborhood bookstore runs a weekly raffle where customers have an equal chance of winning one of three prizes: a $10 gift card, a $25 gift card, or a $50 gift card. If you enter this raffle once each week for 12 consecutive weeks, what is the probability that the total value of your winnings will be exactly $120? Assume each weekly drawing is independent. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem about a neighborhood bookstore's raffle. They have a weekly raffle where customers can win one of three prizes: a $10 gift card, a $25 gift card, or a $50 gift card. Each week, you enter once, and you do this for 12 consecutive weeks. I need to find the probability that the total value of my winnings will be exactly $120. Each weekly drawing is independent, so I can assume that the outcome of one week doesn't affect the others.\n\nFirst, I should understand the problem clearly. Each week, there are three possible prizes with equal chance. So, each prize has a probability of 1/3. I'm entering 12 times, so we're dealing with 12 independent trials. The total winnings after 12 weeks need to be exactly $120. \n\nHmm, so I need to find all possible combinations of the three prizes over 12 weeks that add up to $120. Then, for each of those combinations, calculate the probability and sum them up.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. Since each prize is won with equal probability, this is a multinomial distribution problem. The probability of getting a certain number of each prize can be calculated using the formula for multinomial coefficients. But before diving into that, maybe I can break it down into simpler steps.\n\nFirst, let's denote the number of times I win each prize:\n\n- Let x be the number of $10 gift cards.\n- Let y be the number of $25 gift cards.\n- Let z be the number of $50 gift cards.\n\nSo, we have x + y + z = 12, since I enter 12 times.\n\nThe total winnings would be 10x + 25y + 50z = 120.\n\nSo, I need to find all non-negative integer solutions (x, y, z) to the system:\n\n1. x + y + z = 12\n2. 10x + 25y + 50z = 120\n\nOnce I find all possible (x, y, z) triplets that satisfy both equations, I can compute the probability for each triplet and sum them up.\n\nLet me start by simplifying the second equation. If I divide the entire equation by 5, it becomes:\n\n2x + 5y + 10z = 24\n\nNow, the system is:\n\n1. x + y + z = 12\n2. 2x + 5y + 10z = 24\n\nI can use substitution or elimination to solve this. Let me try elimination.\n\nFrom the first equation, x = 12 - y - z.\n\nSubstitute this into the second equation:\n\n2*(12 - y - z) + 5y + 10z = 24\n\nCalculate that:\n\n24 - 2y - 2z + 5y + 10z = 24\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n24 + (5y - 2y) + (10z - 2z) = 24\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n24 + 3y + 8z = 24\n\nSubtract 24 from both sides:\n\n3y + 8z = 0\n\nHmm, that's interesting. 3y + 8z = 0. Since y and z are non-negative integers, the only solution is y = 0 and z = 0.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me double-check my substitution.\n\nOriginal substitution: x = 12 - y - z.\n\nPlugging into the second equation:\n\n2*(12 - y - z) + 5y + 10z = 24\n\nWhich is 24 - 2y - 2z + 5y + 10z = 24\n\nSo, combining terms: 24 + 3y + 8z = 24\n\nYes, that's correct. So, 3y + 8z = 0.\n\nSince y and z are non-negative integers, the only solution is y=0 and z=0.\n\nSo, that would mean x = 12 - y - z = 12 - 0 - 0 = 12.\n\nSo, the only solution is x=12, y=0, z=0.\n\nWait, but that seems odd. If I only won $10 gift cards all 12 weeks, that would give me 12 * $10 = $120, which matches the total. But are there any other combinations?\n\nLet me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in simplifying.\n\nWait, the original winnings equation is 10x + 25y + 50z = 120.\n\nIf I factor out 5, it becomes 2x + 5y + 10z = 24.\n\nThen, from x + y + z = 12, I can express x = 12 - y - z.\n\nSubstituting into 2x + 5y + 10z = 24 gives:\n\n2*(12 - y - z) + 5y + 10z = 24\n\nWhich is 24 - 2y - 2z + 5y + 10z = 24\n\nSimplify: 24 + 3y + 8z = 24\n\nSo, 3y + 8z = 0.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the only solution is y=0, z=0.\n\nTherefore, the only way to get exactly $120 is to win a $10 gift card each week for 12 weeks.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's another way. Suppose I won a $50 gift card once. Then, I would need 120 - 50 = $70 from 11 weeks.\n\nBut 70 can't be achieved by $10 and $25, because 70 is not a multiple of 5? Wait, no, 70 is a multiple of 5. Let me see.\n\nWait, 70 is 10x + 25y = 70.\n\nWhich can be written as 2x + 5y = 14.\n\nAnd since x + y = 11, because if I have one $50, then x + y = 11.\n\nSo, we have:\n\nx + y = 11\n\n2x + 5y = 14\n\nLet me solve this system.\n\nFrom the first equation, x = 11 - y.\n\nSubstitute into the second equation:\n\n2*(11 - y) + 5y = 14\n\n22 - 2y + 5y = 14\n\n22 + 3y = 14\n\n3y = -8\n\ny = -8/3\n\nThat's not possible because y can't be negative. So, no solution here.\n\nSimilarly, if I try to have two $50 gift cards, that would be 100, leaving 20 to be made from 10 weeks.\n\n20 = 10x + 25y.\n\nDivide by 5: 4 = 2x + 5y.\n\nAnd x + y = 10.\n\nSo, x = 10 - y.\n\nSubstitute:\n\n2*(10 - y) + 5y = 4\n\n20 - 2y + 5y = 4\n\n20 + 3y = 4\n\n3y = -16\n\nAgain, y negative. Not possible.\n\nSimilarly, three $50s would give 150, which is more than 120, so that's out.\n\nWhat if I tried to have one $25 and see if that works?\n\nSo, suppose I have one $25. Then, 120 -25 = 95 from 11 weeks.\n\n95 needs to be made from 10s and 50s.\n\nWait, 95 is 10x + 50z.\n\nSo, 10x + 50z = 95\n\nDivide by 5: 2x + 10z = 19\n\nBut 2x +10z = 19. Left side is even, right side is odd. So, no solution.\n\nSimilarly, if I have two $25s: 120 -50 =70 from 10 weeks.\n\n70 =10x +25y.\n\nDivide by 5: 14 = 2x +5y.\n\nAnd x + y =10.\n\nSo, x=10 - y.\n\nSubstitute:\n\n2*(10 - y) +5y =14\n\n20 -2y +5y=14\n\n20 +3y=14\n\n3y= -6\n\ny=-2. Not possible.\n\nSimilarly, three $25s would be 75, leaving 45 from 9 weeks.\n\n45=10x +25y.\n\nDivide by5:9=2x +5y.\n\nAnd x + y=9.\n\nx=9 - y.\n\nSubstitute:\n\n2*(9 - y) +5y=9\n\n18 -2y +5y=9\n\n18 +3y=9\n\n3y= -9\n\ny= -3. Not possible.\n\nSo, it seems that having any $25 or $50 gift cards doesn't work because it leads to negative numbers of prizes, which isn't possible.\n\nSimilarly, what if I tried to have some $25s and $50s?\n\nWait, let's try with one $25 and one $50.\n\nThen, 25 +50=75, leaving 45 from 10 weeks.\n\n45=10x +25y.\n\nDivide by5:9=2x +5y.\n\nAnd x + y=10.\n\nSo, x=10 - y.\n\nSubstitute:\n\n2*(10 - y) +5y=9\n\n20 -2y +5y=9\n\n20 +3y=9\n\n3y= -11\n\ny= -11/3. Not possible.\n\nSame issue.\n\nSimilarly, two $25s and one $50: 25*2 +50=100, leaving 20 from 9 weeks.\n\n20=10x +25y.\n\nDivide by5:4=2x +5y.\n\nAnd x + y=9.\n\nx=9 - y.\n\nSubstitute:\n\n2*(9 - y) +5y=4\n\n18 -2y +5y=4\n\n18 +3y=4\n\n3y= -14\n\ny= -14/3. Not possible.\n\nSame problem.\n\nAlternatively, what if I have more $25s?\n\nWait, but the more $25s I have, the higher the total would be, but we need exactly $120.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this differently. Since the only solution from the equations was x=12, y=0, z=0, maybe that's the only way to get exactly $120.\n\nBut let me think again. Maybe I missed something.\n\nSuppose I have some combination of $10, $25, and $50 that adds up to $120 in 12 weeks.\n\nLet me consider that each week, the possible winnings are $10, $25, or $50.\n\nOver 12 weeks, the total is $120.\n\nBut if I have any $25 or $50, the total would exceed $120 or require negative prizes, which isn't possible.\n\nWait, let's test with one $25 and the rest $10s.\n\nSo, 1*25 +11*10=25 +110=135>120. So, that's too much.\n\nSimilarly, one $50 and 11 $10s=50+110=160>120.\n\nWhat about one $25 and 11 weeks: 25 +11*10=135>120.\n\nAlternatively, one $50 and 11 weeks: 50 +110=160>120.\n\nSo, having any $25 or $50 would make the total exceed $120.\n\nAlternatively, having no $25 or $50, all $10s: 12*10=120, which works.\n\nAlternatively, is there a way to have some $25s and $50s that would sum to 120 without exceeding?\n\nWait, let's think differently. Let me try to see if 120 can be expressed as 10x +25y +50z, with x+y+z=12.\n\nWe can think of this as a linear Diophantine equation in three variables.\n\nLet me set up the equations:\n\n10x +25y +50z =120\n\nx + y + z =12\n\nLet me divide the first equation by 5:\n\n2x +5y +10z=24\n\nAnd the second equation remains x + y + z=12.\n\nNow, let me subtract 2 times the second equation from the first equation:\n\n(2x +5y +10z) - 2*(x + y + z) =24 -2*12\n\nWhich is 2x +5y +10z -2x -2y -2z=24-24\n\nSimplify: 3y +8z=0\n\nSo, 3y +8z=0.\n\nSince y and z are non-negative integers, the only solution is y=0 and z=0.\n\nTherefore, x=12.\n\nSo, the only solution is x=12, y=0, z=0.\n\nThat means the only way to have exactly $120 is to win a $10 gift card each week for 12 weeks.\n\nTherefore, the probability is the probability of winning $10 gift card 12 times in a row, with each week independent.\n\nSince each prize has a probability of 1/3, the probability of winning $10 each week is (1/3)^12.\n\nBut wait, is that the only way? Because in the equations, we only get that solution. So, yes, the only way to get exactly $120 is to win $10 twelve times.\n\nTherefore, the probability is (1/3)^12.\n\nCalculating that:\n\n(1/3)^12 = 1 / 531441 \u2248 0.00000188.\n\nBut let me confirm once more. Is there any other combination that could give exactly $120?\n\nSuppose I have one $25 and 11 weeks: 25 + 11*10=135>120.\n\nAlternatively, one $50 and 11 weeks:50 +11*10=160>120.\n\nWhat about two $25s and 10 weeks: 50 +10*10=110<120.\n\nBut then I need 10 more, but I only have 10 weeks. Wait, no, if I have two $25s, that's 2 weeks, and 10 weeks left.\n\nBut 2*25=50, and 10*10=100, total 150>120.\n\nAlternatively, two $25s and 10 weeks: 2*25 +10*10=50+100=150>120.\n\nAlternatively, one $25, one $50, and 10 weeks:25+50=75, and 10*10=100, total 175>120.\n\nAlternatively, three $25s and 9 weeks:75 +90=165>120.\n\nAlternatively, one $25, two $50s:25+100=125>120.\n\nAlternatively, two $25s and two $50s:50+100=150>120.\n\nAlternatively, four $25s:100 + 8*10=140>120.\n\nAlternatively, five $25s:125>120.\n\nSo, all these combinations either exceed $120 or require negative weeks.\n\nAlternatively, what about using $50s and $25s to get exactly $120.\n\nSuppose I have two $50s:100, and then I need 20 more from 10 weeks.\n\n20 can be made by two $10s:20=2*10.\n\nSo, that would be x=2, y=0, z=2.\n\nWait, let's check that.\n\nx=2, y=0, z=2.\n\nSo, total weeks:2+0+2=4, but we need 12 weeks.\n\nWait, no, that's only 4 weeks.

End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: A neighborhood bookstore runs a weekly raffle where customers have an equal chance of winning one of three prizes: a $10 gift card, a $25 gift card, or a $50 gift card. If you enter this raffle once each week for 12 consecutive weeks, what is the probability that the total value of your winnings will be exactly $120? Assume each weekly drawing is independent. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this probability problem to solve, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to understand what the question is asking. \n\nThe problem is about a neighborhood bookstore that runs a weekly raffle. Each week, customers have an equal chance of winning one of three prizes: a $10 gift card, a $25 gift card, or a $50 gift card. I enter this raffle once each week for 12 consecutive weeks. I need to find the probability that the total value of my winnings will be exactly $120. Also, it's mentioned that each weekly drawing is independent.\n\nOkay, so to rephrase, I'm buying a raffle ticket every week for 12 weeks, and each time I have an equal chance of winning $10, $25, or $50. I want to calculate the probability that the sum of all my winnings over these 12 weeks is exactly $120.\n\nFirst, let me note down what I know:\n\n1. Each week, I win one of three prizes: $10, $25, or $50. The probability of winning each prize is equal, so each has a probability of 1/3.\n\n2. I participate in this raffle for 12 weeks, so I have 12 independent trials.\n\n3. I want the total winnings over these 12 weeks to add up exactly to $120.\n\nSo, I need to model this scenario as a probability problem where each week contributes a certain amount to the total, and I need the sum of these contributions to be exactly $120.\n\nThis sounds like a problem that can be approached using probability theory, specifically using the concept of expected value and maybe generating functions or combinatorics. Since the winnings each week are independent and identically distributed, it might be useful to model this as a sum of independent random variables.\n\nLet me think about how to model the total winnings.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- \\( X_i \\) as the amount won in the \\( i^{th} \\) week, where \\( i = 1, 2, ..., 12 \\).\n\nEach \\( X_i \\) can take values 10, 25, or 50, each with probability 1/3.\n\nSo, the total winnings after 12 weeks, \\( S = X_1 + X_2 + \\dots + X_{12} \\).\n\nWe need to find \\( P(S = 120) \\).\n\nSince each \\( X_i \\) is independent, the probability distribution of \\( S \\) is the convolution of the distributions of each \\( X_i \\).\n\nHowever, calculating this directly might be complicated because the number of possible combinations could be large.\n\nAnother approach is to consider the generating function for the weekly winnings.\n\nThe generating function for a single week's winnings is:\n\n\\( G(x) = \\frac{1}{3}x^{10} + \\frac{1}{3}x^{25} + \\frac{1}{3}x^{50} \\).\n\nThen, the generating function for the total winnings over 12 weeks is \\( [G(x)]^{12} \\).\n\nThe coefficient of \\( x^{120} \\) in this expansion will give the probability \\( P(S = 120) \\).\n\nBut expanding \\( [G(x)]^{12} \\) manually is not feasible. Maybe there's a smarter way or perhaps using multinomial coefficients.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to model this as a problem of finding the number of sequences of 12 winnings (each being 10, 25, or 50) that add up to 120, multiplied by the probability of each such sequence.\n\nSo, let's denote:\n\nLet \\( n_{10} \\) be the number of weeks where I won $10.\n\nSimilarly, \\( n_{25} \\) for $25, and \\( n_{50} \\) for $50.\n\nSince I participated for 12 weeks, \\( n_{10} + n_{25} + n_{50} = 12 \\).\n\nThe total winnings can be expressed as:\n\n\\( 10n_{10} + 25n_{25} + 50n_{50} = 120 \\).\n\nSo, we need to find all non-negative integer solutions to the system:\n\n1. \\( n_{10} + n_{25} + n_{50} = 12 \\)\n\n2. \\( 10n_{10} + 25n_{25} + 50n_{50} = 120 \\)\n\nEach solution corresponds to a combination of weeks where I won each prize. For each such solution, the number of sequences is \\( \\frac{12!}{n_{10}!n_{25}!n_{50}!} \\), and each sequence has a probability of \\( \\left( \\frac{1}{3} \\right)^{12} \\).\n\nSo, the probability \\( P \\) is:\n\n\\( P = \\left( \\frac{1}{3} \\right)^{12} \\times \\sum \\frac{12!}{n_{10}!n_{25}!n_{50}!} \\)\n\nWhere the sum is over all valid triples \\( (n_{10}, n_{25}, n_{50}) \\) that satisfy both equations above.\n\nTherefore, my task reduces to finding all valid triples \\( (n_{10}, n_{25}, n_{50}) \\) that satisfy the two equations, compute the multinomial coefficients for each, sum them up, and then multiply by \\( \\left( \\frac{1}{3} \\right)^{12} \\) to get the probability.\n\nSo, first, let's solve the system of equations.\n\nLet me write the two equations again:\n\n1. \\( n_{10} + n_{25} + n_{50} = 12 \\)\n\n2. \\( 10n_{10} + 25n_{25} + 50n_{50} = 120 \\)\n\nLet me try to manipulate these equations to find possible values of \\( n_{10}, n_{25}, n_{50} \\).\n\nFirst, let's divide the second equation by 5 to simplify:\n\n\\( 2n_{10} + 5n_{25} + 10n_{50} = 24 \\).\n\nNow, let's write equation 1 as:\n\n\\( n_{10} + n_{25} + n_{50} = 12 \\).\n\nLet me denote equation 1 as E1 and the modified equation 2 as E2.\n\nSo, E1: \\( n_{10} + n_{25} + n_{50} = 12 \\)\n\nE2: \\( 2n_{10} + 5n_{25} + 10n_{50} = 24 \\)\n\nLet me subtract 2*E1 from E2:\n\nE2 - 2*E1:\n\n\\( (2n_{10} + 5n_{25} + 10n_{50}) - 2*(n_{10} + n_{25} + n_{50})) = 24 - 2*12 \\)\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\( 2n_{10} + 5n_{25} + 10n_{50} - 2n_{10} - 2n_{25} - 2n_{50} = 24 - 24 \\)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n\\( 3n_{25} + 8n_{50} = 0 \\)\n\nWait, that can't be right. Let me check my calculations.\n\nWait, 24 - 2*12 is 0, correct.\n\nSo, E2 - 2*E1:\n\n2n10 +5n25 +10n50 - 2n10 - 2n25 - 2n50 = 0\n\nSo, (2n10 - 2n10) + (5n25 - 2n25) + (10n50 - 2n50) = 0\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n0 + 3n25 + 8n50 = 0\n\nSo, 3n25 + 8n50 = 0\n\nHmm, since n25 and n50 are non-negative integers, the only solution is n25 = 0 and n50 = 0.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because if both n25 and n50 are zero, then from E1, n10 = 12.\n\nLet me check that.\n\nIf n25 = 0 and n50 = 0, then from E1, n10 = 12.\n\nThen, total winnings would be 10*12 = 120, which matches the target.\n\nSo, that's one solution: n10=12, n25=0, n50=0.\n\nBut wait, are there any other solutions?\n\nBecause 3n25 + 8n50 = 0, and since n25 and n50 are non-negative integers, the only solution is n25=0 and n50=0.\n\nTherefore, the only possible combination is when I won $10 every week for 12 weeks.\n\nBut that seems counterintuitive because I could also have won some combination of $25 and $50s and still sum up to 120.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the equations.\n\nLet me double-check.\n\nOriginal winnings: 10n10 +25n25 +50n50 =120\n\nNumber of weeks: n10 +n25 +n50=12\n\nSo, let me write equation E2 as 2n10 +5n25 +10n50=24, correct.\n\nThen, E2 -2*E1:\n\n(2n10 +5n25 +10n50) -2*(n10 +n25 +n50)=24 -24=0\n\nWhich gives 3n25 +8n50=0, which indeed implies n25=0 and n50=0.\n\nTherefore, the only solution is n10=12, n25=0, n50=0.\n\nSo, that means the only way to get a total of $120 is to win $10 every week for 12 weeks.\n\nIs that correct?\n\nWait, let's think differently. Maybe I can have a combination of $25 and $50s that also sum up to 120 over 12 weeks.\n\nBut according to the equations, it's not possible because 3n25 +8n50 must equal zero, which only happens when both n25 and n50 are zero.\n\nTherefore, the only way to reach exactly $120 is to win $10 each week for 12 weeks.\n\nBut let me verify this by considering an example.\n\nSuppose I win $25 once and $50 once, then the total would be 25 +50=75, and the rest 11 weeks would need to make up 45 more to reach 120.\n\nBut wait, each week I can only win one prize, so if I have 2 weeks where I won $25 and $50, that's 2 weeks, and the remaining 10 weeks must sum to 120 -75=45.\n\nBut 45 over 10 weeks, each week winning at least $10, so 10 weeks * $10 = $100, which is more than 45, so that's not possible.\n\nWait, that can't be. Wait, no, 45 over 10 weeks, but each week you can only win $10, $25, or $50.\n\nBut let's see: 45 can be achieved by, say, 9 weeks of $10 and 1 week of $15, but we don't have a $15 prize. So, that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 3 weeks of $25 and 7 weeks of $10: 3*25=75, 7*10=70, total 145, which is more than 120.\n\nAlternatively, 1 week of $25, 1 week of $50, and 10 weeks of $10: 25+50+10*10=75+100=175>120.\n\nWait, but 120 is less than 12*10=120, so if I win $10 every week, that's exactly 120. If I try to replace some $10s with higher prizes, the total will exceed 120 because $25 and $50 are both higher than $10.\n\nTherefore, it's impossible to have a combination of $25 and $50s without increasing the total beyond 120.\n\nWait, but what if I have negative weeks? No, that's not possible since we can't have negative prizes.\n\nTherefore, the only way to reach exactly 120 is to win $10 every week.\n\nSo, the number of sequences is the number of ways to choose 12 weeks, all with $10, which is just 1.\n\nTherefore, the probability is the probability of winning $10 every week for 12 weeks.\n\nSince each week is independent, the probability is (1/3)^12.\n\nSo, the probability is 1/(3^12).\n\nBut wait, let me confirm again.\n\nIf I try to have any other combination, like one $25 and the rest $10s, how much would that be?\n\nSuppose n25=1, then n10=11, n50=0.\n\nTotal winnings=25 + 11*10=25+110=135>120.\n\nToo much.\n\nSimilarly, n25=2, n10=10, total=50+100=150>120.\n\nn25=3, n10=9, total=75+90=165>120.\n\nSimilarly, n50=1, n10=11, total=50+110=160>120.\n\nn50=2, n10=10, total=100+100=200>120.\n\nn50=3, n10=9, total=150+90=240>120.\n\nWait, but what if I have more weeks with $25 and $50, but that would require more weeks, but I only have 12 weeks.\n\nWait, but even if I have n25=0, n50=1, n10=11, total=50+110=160>120.\n\nSimilarly, n50=2, n10=10, total=100+100=200>120.\n\nSo, any inclusion of a $25 or $50 prize increases the total beyond 120, given that the rest are $10s.\n\nTherefore, it's impossible to have a total of exactly 120 unless all 12 prizes are $10.\n\nTherefore, the only possible combination is n10=12, n25=0, n50=0.\n\nTherefore, the number of such sequences is 1, and the probability is (1/3)^12.\n\nCalculating that:\n\n(1/3)^12 = 1 / 531441.\n\nSo, the probability is 1/531441.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there any other way to reach 120?\n\nSuppose I have n25=1, n50=1, then n10=10.\n\nTotal winnings=25+50+10*10=75+100=175>120.\n\nNo good.\n\nAlternatively, n25=4, n50=0, then n10=8.\n\nTotal=4*25 +8*10=100+80=180>120.\n\nStill too much.\n\nn25=5, n10=7: 125+70=195>120.\n\nSimilarly, n50=1, n10=11: 50+110=160>120.\n\nWait, what if I have n50= -something? No, that's impossible.\n\nAlternatively, is there a way to have more $25s and fewer $50s?\n\nWait, but each $25 is 25, which is more than $10, so adding any $25s will increase the total beyond 120 unless compensated by more $10s, but since the total number of weeks is fixed at 12, adding more $25s requires reducing the number of $10s, which would lower the total. Wait, but $25 is more than $10, so replacing a $10 with a $25 increases the total by $15.\n\nSimilarly, replacing a $10 with a $50 increases the total by $40.\n\nBut since we need to reach exactly $120, which is the same as 12*$10, any replacement would either increase or decrease the total.\n\nWait, but we can't decrease the total below 120 because the minimum per week is $10.\n\nSo, if I have any $25s or $50s, the total would be higher than 120, which we don't want.\n\nTherefore, the only way to have the total be exactly 120 is to have all 12 prizes be $10.\n\nTherefore, the number of favorable outcomes is 1, and the probability is (1/3)^12.\n\nSo, the probability is 1/531441.\n\nBut let me think again if there's a way to have some $25s and $50s without exceeding 120.\n\nWait, suppose I have 12 weeks, and I want the total to be 120.\n\nEach week, I can only win 10,25, or50.\n\nIf I have k weeks of $25 and m weeks of $50, then the remaining (12 -k -m) weeks are $10.\n\nSo, total winnings:\n\n10*(12 -k -m) +25k +50m =120.\n\nSimplify:\n\n120 -10k -10m +25k +50m =120\n\nSo, 120 +15k +40m =120\n\nTherefore, 15k +40m=0\n\nSince k and m are non-negative integers, the only solution is k=0 and m=0.\n\nTherefore, the only solution is k=0, m=0, which means all 12 weeks are $10.\n\nTherefore, indeed, the only way to reach exactly 120 is to win $10 every week.\n\nTherefore, the probability is (1/3)^12 = 1/531441.\n\nSo, the final answer is 1/531441.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm this once more.\n\nSuppose I have 12 weeks, and I want the total to be 120.\n\nEach week, I can only win 10,25,50.\n\nIf I have any week where I won more than 10, say 25 or 50, then the total would be more than 120 because 25 >10 and 50>10.\n\nTherefore, the only way to have the total be exactly 120 is to have all 12 weeks be 10.\n\nHence, the probability is (1/3)^12.\n\nCalculating 3^12:\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\n3^11=177147\n\n3^12=531441\n\nYes, so 3^12=531441.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 1/531441.\n\nSo, the final answer is 1/531441.\n\nDONE.\n</think>\n\nThe probability that the total value of your winnings will be exactly $120 is \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{531441}}. \n\nDONE."

If you enter this raffle once each week for 12 consecutive weeks, what is the probability that the total value of your winnings will be exactly $120? Assume each weekly drawing is independent. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this probability problem to solve, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and make sure I understand what's being asked.\n\nThe problem says: A neighborhood bookstore runs a weekly raffle where customers have an equal chance of winning one of three prizes: a $10 gift card, a $25 gift card, or a $50 gift card. If I enter this raffle once each week for 12 consecutive weeks, what is the probability that the total value of my winnings will be exactly $120? They also mention that each weekly drawing is independent.\n\nOkay, so I need to find the probability that, over 12 weeks, the total amount I win is exactly $120. Each week, I can win $10, $25, or $50, each with equal chance. Since it's independent each week, the outcome of one week doesn't affect the others.\n\nFirst, let me break down what I know:\n\n- There are 12 independent trials (weeks).\n- Each trial has three possible outcomes: $10, $25, or $50.\n- Each outcome is equally likely, so the probability of winning each prize each week is 1/3.\n\nSo, each week, the probability of winning $10 is 1/3, same for $25 and $50.\n\nI need the total winnings over 12 weeks to be exactly $120. So, I'm looking for the probability that the sum of 12 independent variables, each taking values 10, 25, or 50 with equal probability, equals 120.\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be approached using probability theory, specifically with generating functions or maybe the multinomial distribution. Alternatively, dynamic programming could be used, but since it's a small number of weeks (12), perhaps a combinatorial approach is feasible.\n\nLet me consider the generating function approach because it can handle the sum of independent variables nicely.\n\nFor each week, the generating function (GF) representing the possible winnings is:\n\nGF_week = (x^10) + (x^25) + (x^50)\n\nSince each week is independent, the generating function for 12 weeks is [GF_week]^12.\n\nSo, the total generating function is:\n\nGF_total = (x^10 + x^25 + x^50)^12\n\nThe coefficient of x^120 in this expansion will give the number of ways to achieve a total of $120. Then, to find the probability, I need to divide that coefficient by the total number of possible outcomes, which is 3^12, since each week has 3 possible outcomes.\n\nTherefore, the probability P is:\n\nP = (coefficient of x^120 in (x^10 + x^25 + x^50)^12) / 3^12\n\nNow, I need to find that coefficient. Calculating this directly might be complicated, but perhaps there's a smarter way.\n\nAlternatively, I can model this as a problem of finding the number of integer solutions to the equation:\n\n10a + 25b + 50c = 120\n\nWhere a, b, c are non-negative integers, and a + b + c = 12 (since I have 12 weeks, and each week I win one prize).\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because in each week, I have to choose one prize, so a + b + c should equal 12, but each prize has a different value, so the total value is 10a + 25b + 50c.\n\nSo, I need to find all possible triples (a, b, c) where a + b + c = 12 and 10a + 25b + 50c = 120.\n\nThen, for each such triple, the number of ways is the multinomial coefficient: 12! / (a! b! c!)\n\nSo, the total number of favorable outcomes is the sum over all valid (a, b, c) of 12! / (a! b! c!), and the probability is that sum divided by 3^12.\n\nTherefore, my task reduces to finding all non-negative integer solutions (a, b, c) to the system:\n\na + b + c = 12\n\n10a + 25b + 50c = 120\n\nThen, for each solution, compute the multinomial coefficient and sum them up.\n\nThis seems manageable. Let me try to solve this system.\n\nFirst, from the first equation, a = 12 - b - c.\n\nSubstitute this into the second equation:\n\n10*(12 - b - c) + 25b + 50c = 120\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n120 - 10b - 10c + 25b + 50c = 120\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n120 + (25b -10b) + (50c -10c) = 120\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n120 + 15b + 40c = 120\n\nSubtract 120 from both sides:\n\n15b + 40c = 0\n\nNow, since b and c are non-negative integers, the only solution is b=0 and c=0.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, 15b + 40c = 0 implies that both b and c must be zero.\n\nBut then, a = 12 - b - c = 12.\n\nSo, the only solution is a=12, b=0, c=0.\n\nIs that possible? Let me check.\n\nIf a=12, then total winnings would be 10*12 = $120, which matches.\n\nSo, the only way to reach exactly $120 is to win the $10 prize every week for 12 weeks.\n\nTherefore, the number of favorable outcomes is the number of ways to choose 12 weeks, each time winning the $10 prize.\n\nThe number of such outcomes is 1 (since each week, you have to win the same prize), but wait, no. Actually, each week, the chance is 1/3, and since they are independent, the probability is (1/3)^12.\n\nWait, but according to the earlier approach, the number of favorable outcomes is 12! / (12! 0! 0!) = 1, and the total number of outcomes is 3^12.\n\nThus, the probability is 1 / 3^12.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Is that the only solution? Because 15b +40c=0 only when b=0 and c=0. So, yes, that's the only solution.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me double-check.\n\nFrom a + b + c =12, so a=12 -b -c.\n\nPlug into the value equation:\n\n10*(12 - b - c) +25b +50c =120\n\nCompute:\n\n120 -10b -10c +25b +50c =120\n\nCombine terms:\n\n120 + (25b -10b) + (50c -10c) =120\n\nWhich is 120 +15b +40c=120\n\nSo, 15b +40c=0\n\nYes, that's correct. Since 15 and 40 are positive, the only solution is b=0 and c=0.\n\nTherefore, a=12.\n\nSo, the only way to get exactly $120 is to win the $10 prize 12 times.\n\nTherefore, the number of favorable outcomes is 1 (since all 12 weeks must result in $10), and the total number of possible outcomes is 3^12.\n\nThus, the probability is 1 / 3^12.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is that accurate? Because in each week, you have 3 choices, so over 12 weeks, 3^12 total possible outcome combinations.\n\nBut in terms of sequences, each outcome is a sequence of 12 prizes, each being 10, 25, or 50.\n\nThe number of sequences where all 12 are 10s is just 1.\n\nTherefore, the probability is indeed 1 / 3^12.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as multinomial coefficients. The number of ways to have 12 weeks with 12 wins of $10, 0 wins of $25, and 0 wins of $50 is 12! / (12! 0! 0!) =1.\n\nHence, the probability is 1 / 3^12.\n\nWait, but 3^12 is a large number, so the probability is quite small.\n\nBut let me compute 3^12 to be precise.\n\n3^1=3\n\n3^2=9\n\n3^3=27\n\n3^4=81\n\n3^5=243\n\n3^6=729\n\n3^7=2187\n\n3^8=6561\n\n3^9=19683\n\n3^10=59049\n\n3^11=177147\n\n3^12=531441\n\nSo, 3^12=531,441.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 1/531,441 \u2248 0.00000188, which is about 0.000188%.\n\nThat seems extremely low, but given that each week you have only a 1/3 chance of winning $10, over 12 weeks, it's very unlikely to win $10 every single time.\n\nWait, but let me think again: is there any other way to reach $120?\n\nSuppose I try to see if there are other combinations.\n\nFor example, what if I win a $25 and a $50 in some weeks, but the rest are $10s.\n\nBut let's see: Let's suppose I have one week with $25 and one week with $50. Then, total would be 25 +50=75. The remaining 10 weeks would need to make up 120 -75=45, but 45 can't be achieved with $10s because 45 is not a multiple of 10. So that's impossible.\n\nAlternatively, if I have two weeks with $25: 25*2=50, and two weeks with $50: 50*2=100, total so far 150, which is more than 120. So that's too much.\n\nAlternatively, let's see if it's possible to have a combination of $25 and $50 that adds up to 120 when combined with $10s.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s say I have x weeks of $25, y weeks of $50, and z weeks of $10.\n\nWe have x + y + z =12\n\nAnd 25x +50y +10z=120\n\nWe can simplify the value equation by dividing by 5:\n\n5x +10y +2z=24\n\nSo, 5x +10y +2z=24\n\nWe can write this as:\n\n5x +10y +2z=24\n\nLet me try to find non-negative integers x, y, z such that this holds.\n\nWe can also note that 5x +10y must be even because 2z is even, and 24 is even.\n\nLooking at 5x +10y: 5x is a multiple of 5, and 10y is a multiple of 10, so 5x +10y is a multiple of 5.\n\nSo, 5x +10y must be a multiple of 5 and also contribute to 24 when added to 2z.\n\nWait, but 24 is not a multiple of 5, so 5x +10y must be less than 24, and 24 - (5x +10y) must be even.\n\nLet me consider possible values for y (number of $50 weeks).\n\nSince each $50 is 50, and we have 12 weeks, the maximum y can be is 2 because 50*3=150 >120.\n\nSo y can be 0,1,2.\n\nCase 1: y=0\n\nThen, 5x +10*0 +2z=24 \u2192 5x +2z=24\n\nWe need x and z non-negative integers.\n\nLet me express this as 5x +2z=24.\n\nWe can solve for z:\n\n2z=24 -5x\n\nSo, 24 -5x must be non-negative and even.\n\n5x \u226424 \u2192 x \u22644 (since 5*5=25>24)\n\nx can be 0,1,2,3,4.\n\nLet's check each x:\n\nx=0:\n\n2z=24 \u2192 z=12\n\nBut x=0, y=0, z=12: x+y+z=12, which satisfies the total weeks.\n\nSo, (x,y,z)=(0,0,12). But wait, 25*0 +50*0 +10*12=120. Yes, that's the case we had before.\n\nx=1:\n\n2z=24 -5=19 \u2192 z=9.5, which is not integer. So invalid.\n\nx=2:\n\n2z=24 -10=14 \u2192 z=7\n\nCheck x+y+z=2+0+7=9\u226012. Wait, no, wait: x+y+z=2+0+7=9, which is less than 12. But we have x+y+z=12 because each week you have to choose a prize. So, this is invalid because z=7, but x+y+z=9, which is less than 12. So, this doesn't satisfy both equations.\n\nWait, no, wait: x+y+z=12 is the total number of weeks, so in this case, if x=2, y=0, z=7, then x+y+z=9, which is less than 12. Therefore, this is impossible because we have only 12 weeks. So, we need x+y+z=12.\n\nWait, but in the value equation, when y=0, x=2, z=7: 2+0+7=9\u226012. So, this is invalid because we have only 12 weeks, and we need to account for all 12 weeks. Therefore, z=7, but then we have 12 - (x+y+z)=12 -9=3 weeks unaccounted for. Therefore, this is not a valid solution.\n\nWait, no, actually, I think I made a mistake here. Because in the value equation, when y=0, x=2, z=7, but x+y+z=9, which is less than 12. Therefore, we have 12 -9=3 weeks unaccounted for. But since each week must be assigned to either x, y, or z, we can't have some weeks unassigned. Therefore, this is not a valid solution because we have to have x+y+z=12.\n\nSo, the only way is if z=12 when x=0, y=0.\n\nSimilarly, let's check x=3:\n\n2z=24 -15=9 \u2192 z=4.5, which is not integer.\n\nx=4:\n\n2z=24 -20=4 \u2192 z=2\n\nNow, x=4, y=0, z=2: x+y+z=6\u226012. So, again, this is invalid because we have only 6 weeks accounted for, leaving 6 weeks unassigned. So, this is not a valid solution.\n\nTherefore, for y=0, the only solution is x=0, y=0, z=12.\n\nCase 2: y=1\n\nSo, y=1.\n\nThen, 5x +10*1 +2z=24 \u21925x +2z=14\n\nAgain, 5x +2z=14\n\nWe need x and z non-negative integers.\n\nExpress z:\n\n2z=14 -5x\n\nSo, 14 -5x must be even and non-negative.\n\n5x \u226414 \u2192x \u22642 (since 5*3=15>14)\n\nx=0:\n\n2z=14 \u2192z=7\n\nCheck x+y+z=0+1+7=8\u226012. So, invalid.\n\nx=1:\n\n2z=14 -5=9 \u2192z=4.5 invalid.\n\nx=2:\n\n2z=14 -10=4 \u2192z=2\n\nCheck x+y+z=2+1+2=5\u226012. So, invalid.\n\nTherefore, no solutions for y=1.\n\nCase3: y=2\n\nSo, y=2.\n\nThen, 5x +10*2 +2z=24 \u21925x +20 +2z=24 \u21925x +2z=4\n\nSo, 5x +2z=4\n\nAgain, x and z non-negative integers.\n\nExpress z:\n\n2z=4 -5x\n\nSo, 4 -5x must be even and non-negative.\n\n5x \u22644 \u2192x=0\n\nx=0:\n\n2z=4 \u2192z=2\n\nCheck x+y+z=0+2+2=4\u226012. So, invalid.\n\nTherefore, no solutions for y=2.\n\nThus, the only solution is when y=0, x=0, z=12.\n\nTherefore, the only way to reach exactly $120 is to win the $10 prize every week for 12 weeks.\n\nTherefore, the number of favorable outcomes is 1 (since all 12 weeks must be $10), and the total number of possible outcomes is 3^12=531,441.\n\nThus, the probability is 1/531,441.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Is there another way?\n\nSuppose I win some $25 and some $50, but then have the rest as $10s.\n\nWait, let's try with y=1, x=1, and z=?\n\nFrom the value equation:\n\n25*1 +50*1 +10z=75 +10z=120 \u219210z=45\u2192z=4.5, which is not integer.\n\nSimilarly, y=1, x=2: 25*2 +50*1=100, so 100 +10z=120\u219210z=20\u2192z=2. So, x=2, y=1, z=2.\n\nCheck total weeks:2+1+2=5\u226012. So, invalid.\n\nSimilarly, y=2, x=1: 25*1 +50*2=25+100=125, which is more than 120. So, no.\n\nWait, but perhaps I can have more weeks.\n\nLet me try y=1, x=3:\n\n25*3 +50*1=75+50=125>120. So, too much.\n\nSimilarly, y=1, x=4: 25*4=100+50=150>120.\n\nNo, that's too much.\n\nAlternatively, y=2, x=0: 50*2=100. Then, 100 +10z=120\u219210z=20\u2192z=2. So, x=0, y=2, z=2. Total weeks:0+2+2=4\u226012. So, invalid.\n\nSimilarly, y=3: 50*3=150>120, so not possible.\n\nWait, perhaps I can have a combination where some weeks have $25 and $50, but then have the remaining weeks as $10s to make up the total.\n\nBut let's see:\n\nSuppose I have x weeks of $25, y weeks of $50, and z weeks of $10.\n\nWe have"

    "solution": "Solve this problem step by step. End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: A neighborhood bookstore runs a weekly raffle where customers have an equal chance of winning one of three prizes: a $10 gift card, a $25 gift card, or a $50 gift card. If you enter this raffle once each week for 12 consecutive weeks, what is the probability that the total value of your winnings will be exactly $120? Assume each weekly drawing is independent. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out the probability that after entering this raffle 12 times, the total value of my winnings is exactly $120. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the problem. Each week, there are three prizes: $10, $25, and $50 gift cards. Each customer has an equal chance of winning one of these, right? So, the probability of winning each prize is the same each week. Since there are three prizes, each prize has a 1/3 chance of being won each week.\n\nI'm entering this raffle once each week for 12 consecutive weeks. So, that's 12 independent trials. Each trial (week) can result in one of three outcomes: $10, $25, or $50. I need to find the probability that the sum of these 12 prizes equals exactly $120.\n\nHmm, okay. So, this is a probability problem involving multiple trials, each with specific outcomes. It sounds like a problem that can be approached using combinatorics, specifically multinomial distributions because there are more than two possible outcomes each week.\n\nLet me recall the multinomial probability formula. The probability of having a specific combination of outcomes over n trials is given by:\n\nP = (n!)/(k1! * k2! * ... * km!) * (p1^k1 * p2^k2 * ... * pm^km)\n\nWhere:\n- n is the total number of trials.\n- ki is the number of times outcome i occurs.\n- pi is the probability of outcome i.\n\nIn this case, each week (trial) has three possible outcomes: 10, 25, or 50. So, m = 3. The probabilities for each outcome are p10 = 1/3, p25 = 1/3, and p50 = 1/3.\n\nI need to find all the possible combinations of 10s, 25s, and 50s over 12 weeks that add up to exactly $120. Then, for each valid combination, calculate the probability and sum them all up.\n\nFirst, let's express $120 in terms of the weekly prizes. Let me define variables:\n\nLet x = number of weeks I won a $10 gift card.\nLet y = number of weeks I won a $25 gift card.\nLet z = number of weeks I won a $50 gift card.\n\nSo, the total number of weeks is x + y + z = 12.\n\nThe total value from these winnings is 10x + 25y + 50z = 120.\n\nWe need to find all non-negative integer solutions (x, y, z) to these equations.\n\nLet me write the equations:\n\n1. x + y + z = 12\n2. 10x + 25y + 50z = 120\n\nI can try to simplify equation 2. Let me divide equation 2 by 5 to make the numbers smaller:\n\n(10x)/5 + (25y)/5 + (50z)/5 = 120/5\nWhich simplifies to:\n2x + 5y + 10z = 24\n\nSo, equation 2 becomes: 2x + 5y + 10z = 24\n\nNow, I can use equation 1 to substitute. Since x + y + z = 12, perhaps I can express x in terms of y and z.\n\nFrom equation 1: x = 12 - y - z\n\nSubstitute x into equation 2:\n\n2*(12 - y - z) + 5y + 10z = 24\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n24 - 2y - 2z + 5y + 10z = 24\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n24 + ( -2y + 5y ) + ( -2z + 10z ) = 24\nWhich is:\n\n24 + 3y + 8z = 24\n\nSubtract 24 from both sides:\n\n3y + 8z = 0\n\nHmm, 3y + 8z = 0. Since y and z are non-negative integers, the only solution is y = 0 and z = 0.\n\nBut wait, that can't be right. Because if y = 0 and z = 0, then from equation 1, x = 12 - 0 - 0 = 12.\n\nSo, x = 12, y = 0, z = 0.\n\nBut then, the total value would be 10*12 + 25*0 + 50*0 = 120, which is exactly what we want.\n\nBut that's only one solution. Is that the only possible combination?\n\nWait, let me double-check my algebra.\n\nStarting from equation 2:\n\n2x + 5y + 10z = 24\n\nAnd equation 1:\n\nx = 12 - y - z\n\nSubstituting:\n\n2*(12 - y - z) + 5y + 10z = 24\n24 - 2y - 2z + 5y + 10z = 24\n24 + 3y + 8z = 24\n\nSo, 3y + 8z = 0.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the only solution is y = 0 and z = 0. Therefore, the only way to get exactly $120 is to win the $10 prize every week for 12 weeks.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit counterintuitive. Let me think again.\n\nIf I won all $10s, that's 12 * 10 = $120. Alternatively, could I have a combination of $25s and $50s that also add up to $120 in 12 weeks?\n\nLet me check. Suppose I won some $25s and $50s, but also some $10s.\n\nWait, but according to the equations, the only solution is x=12, y=0, z=0. So, no, it's not possible to have any $25s or $50s.\n\nLet me see if that makes sense. Suppose I have, say, one $25 and the rest $10s.\n\nThen, total value would be 11*10 + 1*25 = 110 +25=135, which is more than 120.\n\nIf I have one $50, then 11*10 +1*50=110+50=160, which is way more than 120.\n\nIf I have two $25s, that would be 10*10 +2*25=100+50=150.\n\nStill more than 120.\n\nAlternatively, if I have some $50s and $25s but fewer $10s, but then the total weeks would still have to be 12.\n\nWait, but according to the equations, the only solution is y=0, z=0. So, it's not possible to have any $25s or $50s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in setting up the equations.\n\nLet me double-check.\n\nTotal value is 10x +25y +50z=120.\n\nTotal weeks: x+y+z=12.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, substituting x=12 - y - z into the total value:\n\n10*(12 - y - z) +25y +50z = 120\n\nWhich is:\n\n120 -10y -10z +25y +50z = 120\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n120 +15y +40z = 120\n\nSo, 15y +40z=0\n\nWhich simplifies to 3y +8z=0, same as before.\n\nSo, indeed, y=0 and z=0 is the only solution.\n\nTherefore, the only way to get exactly $120 is to win $10 each week for 12 weeks.\n\nBut wait, that seems a bit odd because $10 is the smallest prize, but maybe it's correct.\n\nAlternatively, let me think about it in another way.\n\nSuppose I try to have some $25s and $50s but compensate with fewer $10s.\n\nBut since each week I have to have a total of 12 weeks, the number of $10s, $25s, and $50s must add up to 12.\n\nLet me try to see if there's any other combination.\n\nSuppose I have one $25 and the rest $10s and one $50.\n\nWait, but that would require more than 12 weeks.\n\nWait, let me try:\n\nSuppose I have one $25, one $50, and the remaining 10 weeks with $10s.\n\nTotal weeks: 1+1+10=12.\n\nTotal value: 10*10 +25 +50=100+25+50=175, which is more than 120.\n\nAlternatively, suppose I have two $25s and one $50, and the rest $10s.\n\nTotal weeks:2+1+9=12.\n\nTotal value:10*9 +25*2 +50=90+50+50=190.\n\nStill more than 120.\n\nAlternatively, what if I have some $50s and some $25s, but also some $10s.\n\nWait, but according to the equations, it's impossible because 3y +8z=0 only allows y=0 and z=0.\n\nTherefore, the only way is to have all $10s.\n\nSo, the probability is the probability of winning $10 gift card every week for 12 weeks.\n\nSince each week is independent, the probability is (1/3)^12.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Because each week, the probability of winning $10 is 1/3, and since it's 12 independent weeks, the probability is (1/3)^12.\n\nBut wait, is that correct? Because the number of ways to win 12 times with $10s is just 1 way, since every week you have to win $10. So, the multinomial coefficient is 12! / (12! 0! 0!) =1.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 1 * (1/3)^12.\n\nSo, the probability is (1/3)^12.\n\nCalculating that: (1/3)^12 = 1 / 531441 \u2248 0.00000188.\n\nThat's a very small probability, which makes sense because it's very unlikely to win the same small prize every week.\n\nAlternatively, if I had other combinations, the probability would be higher, but since the only possible combination is all $10s, that's the only term in the probability sum.\n\nTherefore, the probability is (1/3)^12.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the probability is 1/531441.\n</think>\n\nThe only way to achieve a total of $120 is by winning the $10 prize each week for all 12 weeks. The probability of this happening is (1/3)^12.\n\nProbability = (1/3)^12 = 1/531441\n\nDONE."

Each week, I have an equal chance of winning one of these three, so each prize has a probability of 1/3. \n\nFirst, I should understand what the total winnings of $120 means in terms of how many of each prize I could have won over the 12 weeks. Let's denote:\n\n- Let x be the number of $10 prizes I win.\n- Let y be the number of $25 prizes I win.\n- Let z be the number of $50 prizes I win.\n\nSince I'm entering the raffle 12 times, the total number of prizes I win should add up to 12. So, I can write the equation:\n\nx + y + z = 12\n\nAnd the total value of the winnings would be:\n\n10x + 25y + 50z = 120\n\nSo, I need to find all possible non-negative integer solutions (x, y, z) to these two equations. Then, for each solution, I can calculate the probability and sum them up to get the total probability.\n\nLet me start by simplifying the total value equation. If I divide everything by 5, I get:\n\n2x + 5y + 10z = 24\n\nHmm, that might make things a bit easier. Now, I can try to find all combinations of x, y, z that satisfy both equations.\n\nSince x, y, z are non-negative integers, I can try to express x in terms of y and z from the first equation:\n\nx = 12 - y - z\n\nSubstituting into the value equation:\n\n2(12 - y - z) + 5y + 10z = 24\n\nLet me expand that:\n\n24 - 2y - 2z + 5y + 10z = 24\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n24 + (5y - 2y) + (10z - 2z) = 24\n24 + 3y + 8z = 24\n\nSubtract 24 from both sides:\n\n3y + 8z = 0\n\nHmm, 3y + 8z = 0. Since y and z are non-negative integers, the only solution here is y = 0 and z = 0.\n\nWait, that seems odd. So, substituting back, x = 12 - 0 - 0 = 12.\n\nSo, the only solution is x = 12, y = 0, z = 0.\n\nBut let me double-check that. Maybe I made a mistake in my substitution.\n\nOriginal equations:\n\nx + y + z = 12\n10x + 25y + 50z = 120\n\nExpress x as 12 - y - z, plug into the value equation:\n\n10(12 - y - z) + 25y + 50z = 120\n\nCalculating:\n\n120 - 10y - 10z + 25y + 50z = 120\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n120 + (25y - 10y) + (50z - 10z) = 120\n120 + 15y + 40z = 120\n\nSubtract 120 from both sides:\n\n15y + 40z = 0\n\nAgain, this leads to y = 0 and z = 0, so x = 12.\n\nWait, so the only way to get a total of $120 is to win 12 $10 prizes? Because 12 * $10 = $120.\n\nBut let me think about this. If I win more $25 or $50 prizes, the total would exceed $120, right? Because $25 is higher than $10, and $50 is even higher. So, if I win any $25 or $50, the total would go above $120.\n\nFor example, if I win one $25 prize, the remaining 11 weeks would need to total $95, but since the only other prizes are $10 and $50, let's see:\n\nIf I win one $25, then I need 11 prizes such that 10x + 50z = 95.\n\nBut 10x + 50z = 95. Let's see if this is possible.\n\nDivide the equation by 5:\n\n2x + 10z = 19\n\nBut 2x + 10z is even because 2x and 10z are both multiples of 2. But 19 is odd. So, no solution here.\n\nSimilarly, if I win two $25 prizes, then I need 10x + 50z = 120 - 25*2 = 70.\n\nSo, 10x + 50z = 70. Divide by 10: x + 5z = 7.\n\nPossible solutions:\n\nz=0: x=7\nz=1: x=2\nz=2: x= -3 \u2192 Not possible.\n\nSo, z can be 0 or 1.\n\nSo, possible solutions here: (x=7, y=2, z=0) and (x=2, y=2, z=1).\n\nBut wait, if I do that, then the total number of prizes would be x + y + z = 7 + 2 + 0 = 9 and 2 + 2 + 1 = 5, which are both less than 12. So, that doesn't add up. Because in the initial substitution, we have x + y + z = 12, so if I have y=2, then x + z must be 10.\n\nWait, I think I confused myself. Let me clarify.\n\nIf I have y=2, then x + z = 10. And from the value equation, 10x + 50z = 70.\n\nSo, let's write:\n\nFrom x + z = 10, x = 10 - z.\n\nPlug into 10x + 50z = 70:\n\n10(10 - z) + 50z = 70\n100 - 10z + 50z = 70\n100 + 40z = 70\n40z = -30\n\nThat's impossible because z can't be negative. So, no solution when y=2.\n\nSimilarly, if y=3, then x + z = 9, and 10x + 50z = 120 - 75 = 45.\n\nSo, 10x + 50z = 45. Again, 10x + 50z must be a multiple of 5, but 45 is not a multiple of 5. So, no solution.\n\nWait, this seems conflicting with my earlier thought. Maybe I should approach this differently.\n\nLet me think about the possible number of $50 prizes I could have. Since each $50 prize is worth a lot, the maximum number I can have without exceeding $120 is 2, because 3*$50=150 >120.\n\nSo, z can be 0, 1, or 2.\n\nCase 1: z = 0\n\nThen, the total value from $25 and $10 must be $120.\n\nSo, 25y + 10x = 120, and x + y = 12.\n\nSo, from x + y = 12, x = 12 - y.\n\nPlug into the value equation:\n\n25y + 10(12 - y) = 120\n25y + 120 -10y = 120\n15y + 120 = 120\n15y = 0\ny = 0\n\nSo, x = 12, y=0, z=0.\n\nCase 2: z=1\n\nThen, total value needed from $25 and $10 is 120 -50=70.\n\nSo, 25y +10x=70, and x + y=11.\n\nFrom x=11 - y.\n\nPlug into value equation:\n\n25y +10(11 - y)=70\n25y +110 -10y=70\n15y +110=70\n15y= -40\n\nImpossible, since y can't be negative.\n\nCase 3: z=2\n\nTotal value needed from $25 and $10 is 120 -100=20.\n\nSo, 25y +10x=20, and x + y=10.\n\nFrom x=10 - y.\n\nPlug into value equation:\n\n25y +10(10 - y)=20\n25y +100 -10y=20\n15y +100=20\n15y= -80\n\nAgain, impossible.\n\nSo, the only possible case is z=0, y=0, x=12.\n\nTherefore, the only way to get exactly $120 is to win 12 $10 prizes.\n\nNow, to find the probability of this happening.\n\nSince each week is independent, the probability of winning 12 $10 prizes in a row is (1/3)^12.\n\nBut wait, is that correct? Because each prize is independent, but the total is the product of each individual probability.\n\nSo, the probability of winning $10 each week for 12 weeks is (1/3)^12.\n\nBut let me confirm that there are no other combinations that could sum to $120.\n\nWait, earlier I thought maybe y=1 or something, but when I tried, it didn't work out. So, the only way is to win 12 $10s.\n\nTherefore, the probability is (1/3)^12.\n\nCalculating that:\n\n(1/3)^12 = 1 / 531441 \u2248 0.00000188.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Is there a possibility that with some combination of $25 and $50, I can reach exactly $120?\n\nFor example, maybe one $50, and then the rest in $25s and $10s.\n\nWait, let's try that.\n\nSuppose z=1, then I have 50, so remaining is 70.\n\nBut as above, with z=1, 25y +10x=70, and x + y=11.\n\nFrom x=11 - y.\n\nSo, 25y +10(11 - y)=70\n\n25y +110 -10y=70\n\n15y= -40, which is impossible.\n\nSimilarly, z=2, 25y +10x=20, x + y=10.\n\nFrom x=10 - y.\n\n25y +10(10 - y)=20\n\n25y +100 -10y=20\n\n15y= -80, impossible.\n\nSo, no solutions with z=1 or 2.\n\nWhat about z=0, y=1.\n\nThen, 25*1 +10x=120 \u2192 10x=95 \u2192 x=9.5, which is not integer.\n\nSimilarly, z=0, y=2: 25*2=50, 10x=70 \u2192 x=7.\n\nSo, x=7, y=2, z=0.\n\nBut wait, x + y + z=7 +2 +0=9, which is less than 12. So, that's not possible because I need to have 12 prizes.\n\nWait, so in this case, x + y + z=12, so if z=0, y=2, then x=10.\n\nBut 10x +25y=10*10 +25*2=100 +50=150>120. So, that's over.\n\nWait, no, earlier I thought about this and it didn't work. Let me clarify.\n\nIf z=0, y=2, then x=10.\n\nTotal value:10*10 +25*2=100 +50=150>120.\n\nSo, that's over. So, that's not acceptable.\n\nSimilarly, y=1, x=9.5, which isn't possible.\n\nTherefore, the only way to reach exactly $120 is to have z=0, y=0, x=12.\n\nTherefore, the probability is (1/3)^12.\n\nCalculating that:\n\n(1/3)^12 = 1 / 531441 \u2248 0.00000188.\n\nBut wait, let me check if there's another way.\n\nSuppose I have some combination of $25 and $50 that adds up to 120 when multiplied by their respective counts, and the total number of prizes is 12.\n\nWait, let me try z=1, y=1, then x=10.\n\nTotal value:50 +25 +10*10=75 +100=175>120.\n\nToo much.\n\nWhat if z=1, y=0, x=11.\n\nTotal value:50 +110=160>120.\n\nNope.\n\nz=0, y=3, x=9.\n\nTotal value:75 +90=165>120.\n\nStill over.\n\nz=0, y=1, x=11: total=25 +110=135>120.\n\nz=0, y=0, x=12: 120=120. Perfect.\n\nz=1, y=2, x=9: total=50 +50 +90=190>120.\n\nz=1, y=1, x=10: 50 +25 +100=175>120.\n\nz=1, y=0, x=11:50 +110=160>120.\n\nz=2, y=0, x=10:100 +100=200>120.\n\nz=2, y=1, x=9:100 +25 +90=215>120.\n\nz=2, y=2, x=8:100 +50 +80=230>120.\n\nSo, no combination with z=1 or 2 can reach exactly 120 without exceeding it.\n\nSimilarly, trying z=0, y=4, x=8: 100 +80=180>120.\n\nSo, the only way is z=0, y=0, x=12.\n\nTherefore, the probability is indeed (1/3)^12.\n\nBut let me confirm the math again.\n\nEach week, the probability of winning $10 is 1/3, so for 12 weeks, it's (1/3)^12.\n\nBut wait, is that correct? Because each week is independent, so the probability of winning $10 each week is (1/3)^12.\n\nAlternatively, the probability of any specific combination of prizes is (1/3)^12, but since only one combination (12 $10s) leads to exactly $120, the total probability is just that.\n\nSo, the probability is 1 divided by 3 to the power of 12, which is 1/531441.\n\nIn decimal, that's approximately 0.00000188, or 0.000188%.\n\nThat seems very low, but considering how unlikely it is to win the same prize every week for 12 weeks, it makes sense.\n\nSo, the final answer is 1/531441.\n</think>\n\nThe only way to win exactly $120 is to win the $10 prize each week for 12 weeks. The probability of this happening is (1/3)^12.\n\nProbability = 1 / 531441\n\nDONE."
