Problem: Consider the set of points that are inside or within one unit of a rectangular parallelepiped (box) that measures $3$ by $4$ by $5$ units. Given that the volume of this set is $\\frac{m + n\\pi}{p},$ where $m, n,$ and $p$ are positive integers, and $n$ and $p$ are relatively prime, find $m + n + p.$\n Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I need to solve this math problem where I have a box that's 3 by 4 by 5 units. The problem is asking about the set of points that are either inside the box or within one unit of it. Then, it says the volume of this set is (m + n\u03c0)/p, where m, n, and p are positive integers, with n and p being relatively prime. I need to find m + n + p.\n\nFirst, I need to visualize what this set of points looks like. If I have a box, and I consider all points within one unit of the box, that's like adding a sort of \"buffer\" zone around the box. This buffer would include all the points that are touching the box or within one unit from it. So, the total volume would be the volume of the original box plus the volume of this buffer zone.\n\nWait, but actually, when you take all points within one unit of the box, you're effectively creating a sort of expanded shape around the box. This shape includes the original box, plus additional regions around each face, edge, and corner of the box. So, the total volume isn't just the volume of the box plus some simple addition; it's a more complex shape.\n\nI remember that when you take all points within a certain distance from a polyhedron, the resulting shape is called an \"offset\" or \"Minkowski sum\" of the original polyhedron with a sphere. But since we're dealing with a box, which is a convex polyhedron, the Minkowski sum with a sphere would create a shape that has rounded edges and corners. So, the total volume would be the volume of the original box plus the volume added by expanding each face, edge, and corner.\n\nLet me break this down into parts. The total volume will consist of:\n\n1. The volume of the original box.\n2. The volume added by expanding each face outward by 1 unit.\n3. The volume added by expanding each edge outward, which forms quarter-cylinders around each edge.\n4. The volume added by expanding each corner, which forms eighth-spheres at each corner.\n\nSo, if I can compute each of these parts separately, I can sum them up to get the total volume.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the volume of the original box. That's straightforward: length \u00d7 width \u00d7 height. So, 3 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 5. Let me compute that:\n\n3 \u00d7 4 = 12\n12 \u00d7 5 = 60\n\nSo, the volume of the original box is 60 cubic units.\n\nNext, I need to calculate the volume added by expanding each face outward by 1 unit. Each face of the box is a rectangle, and when we expand outward by 1 unit, we're essentially adding a \"layer\" around each face. The volume of each such layer is the area of the face multiplied by 1 unit (the expansion distance).\n\nBut wait, each face is adjacent to other faces, so if I just add the areas of all faces multiplied by 1, I might be overcounting the edges where the expansions meet. Hmm, but actually, in the Minkowski sum, the expansion around each face doesn't overlap with the expansion around the edges because the edges are accounted for separately. Wait, no, actually, when you expand each face, the edges where two faces meet will form quarter-cylinders, and the corners will form eighth-spheres. So, perhaps it's better to compute the face expansions, edge expansions, and corner expansions as separate components without overlapping.\n\nWait, no, actually, the expansion around each face is a rectangular prism extending out from each face. So, each face contributes an additional volume equal to its area times 1 unit, but without considering the edges yet. However, these prisms will meet at the edges, forming quarter-cylinders, and at the corners, forming eighth-spheres. So, perhaps I should compute the face expansions, edge expansions, and corner expansions separately and sum them up.\n\nLet me think: The Minkowski sum volume can be calculated using Steiner's formula, which for a convex polyhedron in 3D, the volume of the offset at distance r is equal to the volume of the original polyhedron plus the surface area times r plus the length of all edges times (\u03c0 r\u00b2)/4 plus the number of vertices times (4\u03c0 r\u00b3)/3 divided by 8, since each vertex contributes an eighth of a sphere.\n\nWait, let me verify this. For a convex polyhedron, the volume of the offset (Minkowski sum) at distance r is given by:\n\nVolume = V + S*r + L*(\u03c0 r\u00b2)/4 + N*(4\u03c0 r\u00b3)/3*(1/8)\n\nWhere:\n- V is the original volume,\n- S is the surface area,\n- L is the total length of all edges,\n- N is the number of vertices.\n\nBut let me check if this is accurate. I recall that in 3D, the Steiner formula is:\n\nVolume = V + S*r + M*(\u03c0 r\u00b2) + (4\u03c0 r\u00b3)/3 * (number of vertices)/8\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think of it as:\n\nWhen you take all points within distance r of a convex polyhedron, the volume is:\n\nV + S*r + L*(\u03c0 r\u00b2)/4 + (4\u03c0 r\u00b3)/3 * (number of vertices)/8\n\nWait, let me think again. Each face contributes a volume of area * r. Each edge contributes a quarter-cylinder of length equal to the edge length, radius r, so each edge contributes (\u03c0 r\u00b2 * length)/4. Each vertex contributes an eighth of a sphere of radius r, so each vertex contributes (4\u03c0 r\u00b3)/3 * 1/8 = \u03c0 r\u00b3/6.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the total volume is:\n\nV + S*r + sum over edges ( (\u03c0 r\u00b2 * length)/4 ) + sum over vertices ( \u03c0 r\u00b3 /6 )\n\nSo, for our problem, r = 1, so let's compute each part.\n\nFirst, let's compute the original volume V, which is 3\u00d74\u00d75=60.\n\nNext, compute the surface area S. The box has 6 faces: two of each pair of dimensions.\n\nSo, the surface area S = 2*(lw + lh + wh) where l=3, w=4, h=5.\n\nSo, S = 2*(3*4 + 3*5 + 4*5) = 2*(12 + 15 + 20) = 2*(47) = 94.\n\nWait, 3*4=12, 3*5=15, 4*5=20. Sum is 12+15=27+20=47. So, 2*47=94. So, S=94.\n\nThen, the next term is sum over edges of (\u03c0 r\u00b2 * length)/4. Since r=1, this becomes sum over edges of (\u03c0 * 1\u00b2 * length)/4 = (\u03c0/4)*sum of edge lengths.\n\nA box has 12 edges: 4 of each length corresponding to length, width, height. So, in our case, the box is 3x4x5, so it has 4 edges of length 3, 4 edges of length 4, and 4 edges of length 5.\n\nWait, no, actually, each dimension has 4 edges. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, in a rectangular box, there are 12 edges: 4 corresponding to length, 4 to width, and 4 to height. But actually, no, it's 12 edges in total, with each pair of opposite edges having the same length. So, for a box with dimensions l, w, h, there are 4 edges of length l, 4 of length w, and 4 of length h.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Wait, actually, each dimension has 4 edges, but arranged in 3 directions. Wait, no, actually, no. Let me think: a rectangular box has 12 edges. For each of the three dimensions, there are 4 edges along that axis. So, for our box, with length 3, width 4, height 5, there are:\n\n- 4 edges of length 3 (along the length),\n- 4 edges of length 4 (along the width),\n- 4 edges of length 5 (along the height).\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Wait, no, actually, for each pair of opposite faces, there are 4 edges. Wait, perhaps I'm confusing.\n\nWait, no, let's clarify: Each rectangular box has 12 edges:\n\n- 4 edges along the length (let's say front top, front bottom, back top, back bottom),\n- 4 edges along the width,\n- 4 edges along the height.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right because 4+4+4=12. But for each dimension, the number of edges is 4. So, for our box, the edges are:\n\n- 4 edges of length 3 (along the length),\n- 4 edges of length 4 (along the width),\n- 4 edges of length 5 (along the height).\n\nWait, no, that doesn't add up because the edges along the length would be of length 'l', which is 3, but in reality, for a box, the edges along the length are actually the ones that form the length of the box. Wait, perhaps it's better to think that for a box with dimensions l, w, h, there are 4 edges of length l, 4 of length w, and 4 of length h. So, in our case, l=3, w=4, h=5, so we have:\n\n- 4 edges of length 3,\n- 4 edges of length 4,\n- 4 edges of length 5.\n\nSo, the total edge length is 4*(3 + 4 + 5) = 4*12=48.\n\nWait, but actually, no, that's the total edge length. Wait, let me compute sum of edge lengths:\n\nsum_edges = 4*(3 + 4 + 5) = 4*12=48.\n\nWait, that's correct. So, sum_edges = 48.\n\nSo, the term for edges is (\u03c0/4)*sum_edges = (\u03c0/4)*48 = 12\u03c0.\n\nNext, the term for vertices. A rectangular box has 8 vertices. Each vertex contributes (\u03c0 r\u00b3)/6. Since r=1, this is (\u03c0*1)/6 = \u03c0/6 per vertex.\n\nSo, total from vertices is 8*(\u03c0/6) = (8\u03c0)/6 = (4\u03c0)/3.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the total volume is:\n\nV + S*r + (\u03c0/4)*sum_edges + 8*(\u03c0 r\u00b3/6).\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\nV = 60,\n\nS*r = 94*1 = 94,\n\nsum_edges term: 12\u03c0,\n\nvertices term: (4\u03c0)/3.\n\nSo, total volume is:\n\n60 + 94 + 12\u03c0 + (4\u03c0)/3.\n\nWait, let me compute this step by step.\n\nFirst, add the non-pi terms: 60 + 94 = 154.\n\nThen, add the pi terms: 12\u03c0 + (4\u03c0)/3.\n\nTo add these, I can express 12\u03c0 as 36\u03c0/3, so 36\u03c0/3 + 4\u03c0/3 = 40\u03c0/3.\n\nSo, total volume is 154 + (40\u03c0)/3.\n\nWait, but the problem states that the volume is (m + n\u03c0)/p. Hmm, but 154 + (40\u03c0)/3 can be written as (154*3 + 40\u03c0)/3 = (462 + 40\u03c0)/3.\n\nSo, m=462, n=40, p=3.\n\nWait, but the problem says the volume is (m + n\u03c0)/p, so this seems to fit.\n\nBut wait, let me check if I did everything correctly.\n\nWait, so let me recap:\n\n- The original box volume is 3\u00d74\u00d75=60.\n\n- The surface area is 2*(3\u00d74 + 3\u00d75 + 4\u00d75)=2*(12+15+20)=2*47=94.\n\n- The sum of edge lengths is 4*(3+4+5)=4*12=48.\n\n- The number of vertices is 8.\n\nSo, using the Steiner formula:\n\nVolume = V + S*r + (\u03c0 r\u00b2/4)*sum_edges + (\u03c0 r\u00b3/6)*number_of_vertices.\n\nSubstituting r=1:\n\nVolume = 60 + 94*1 + (\u03c0/4)*48 + (\u03c0/6)*8.\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n60 + 94 = 154.\n\n(\u03c0/4)*48 = 12\u03c0.\n\n(\u03c0/6)*8 = (8\u03c0)/6 = (4\u03c0)/3.\n\nSo, adding the pi terms: 12\u03c0 + (4\u03c0)/3 = (36\u03c0 + 4\u03c0)/3 = 40\u03c0/3.\n\nThus, total volume is 154 + 40\u03c0/3, which can be written as (154*3 + 40\u03c0)/3 = (462 + 40\u03c0)/3.\n\nSo, m=462, n=40, p=3.\n\nNow, check if n and p are coprime. 40 and 3 have no common factors besides 1, so they are coprime.\n\nThus, m + n + p = 462 + 40 + 3 = 505.\n\nWait, but before I conclude, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the Steiner formula. Let me think again about the components.\n\n- The original volume is correct: 3\u00d74\u00d75=60.\n\n- The surface area: 2*(lw + lh + wh)=2*(12+15+20)=94. Correct.\n\n- Sum of edges: 4*(3+4+5)=48. Correct.\n\n- Each edge contributes a quarter-cylinder of radius 1, so volume per edge is (\u03c0 r\u00b2 * length)/4. Since r=1, that's (\u03c0 * 1 * length)/4. So, for each edge of length L, it's (\u03c0 L)/4. Sum over all edges is (\u03c0/4)*sum_edges = (\u03c0/4)*48=12\u03c0. Correct.\n\n- Each vertex contributes an eighth of a sphere of radius 1, so volume per vertex is (4\u03c0 r\u00b3)/3 * 1/8 = (4\u03c0/3)*(1/8) = \u03c0/6. So, 8 vertices contribute 8*(\u03c0/6)=4\u03c0/3. Correct.\n\nSo, total volume is 60 + 94 + 12\u03c0 + 4\u03c0/3 = 154 + (36\u03c0/3 + 4\u03c0/3) = 154 + 40\u03c0/3.\n\nExpressed as a single fraction: (154*3 + 40\u03c0)/3 = (462 + 40\u03c0)/3.\n\nSo, m=462, n=40, p=3. Sum is 462 + 40 + 3 = 505.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, I think 505 is the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of \\( m + n + p \\) is \\boxed{505}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to find the volume of the set of points that are inside or within one unit of a rectangular parallelepiped (box) measuring 3 by 4 by 5 units. This volume can be computed using Steiner's formula, which accounts for the original volume, the surface area, the edges, and the vertices of the box.\n\n1. **Volume of the original box (V):**\n   \\[\n   V = 3 \\times 4 \\times 5 = 60\n   \\]\n\n2. **Surface area (S) of the box:**\n   \\[\n   S = 2 \\times (3 \\times 4 + 3 \\times 5 + 4 \\times 5) = 2 \\times (12 + 15 + 20) = 2 \\times 47 = 94\n   \\]\n\n3. **Sum of the lengths of all edges (sum_edges):**\n   \\[\n   \\text{sum\\_edges} = 4 \\times (3 + 4 + 5) = 4 \\times 12 = 48\n   \\]\n\n4. **Number of vertices (N) of the box:**\n   \\[\n   N = 8\n   \\]\n\nUsing Steiner's formula, the total volume is given by:\n\\[\n\\text{Volume} = V + S \\times r + \\left(\\frac{\\pi r^2}{4}\\right) \\times \\text{sum\\_edges} + \\left(\\frac{\\pi r^3}{6}\\right) \\times N\n\\]\nwhere \\( r = 1 \\).\n\n5. **Calculating each term:**\n   - \\( S \\times r = 94 \\times 1 = 94 \\)\n   - \\( \\left(\\frac{\\pi \\times 1^2}{4}\\right) \\times 48 = 12\\pi \\)\n   - \\( \\left(\\frac{\\pi \\times 1^3}{6}\\right) \\times 8 = \\frac{4\\pi}{3} \\)\n\n6. **Summing up all terms:**\n   - Non-pi terms: \\( 60 + 94 = 154 \\)\n   - Pi terms: \\( 12\\pi + \\frac{4\\pi}{3} = \\frac{36\\pi}{3} + \\frac{4\\pi}{3} = \\frac{40\\pi}{3} \\)\n\n7. **Total volume:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Volume} = 154 + \\frac{40\\pi}{3} = \\frac{462 + 40\\pi}{3}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the volume is expressed as \\(\\frac{462 + 40\\pi}{3}\\), where \\( m = 462 \\), \\( n = 40 \\), and \\( p = 3 \\).
