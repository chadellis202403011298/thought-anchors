Problem: Find all real numbers $k$ such that\n\\[\\left\\| k \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -3 \\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ 7 \\end{pmatrix} \\right\\| = 2 \\sqrt{13}.\\]Enter all the solutions, separated by commas. Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to find all real numbers k such that the norm (or magnitude) of the vector k times (2, -3) minus (4, 7) is equal to 2 times the square root of 13. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me write down what the problem is asking. The expression inside the norm is a vector, right? So it's the vector k*(2, -3) minus (4, 7). The norm of this resulting vector should be equal to 2\u221a13. So, mathematically, I can write this as:\n\n|| k*(2, -3) - (4, 7) || = 2\u221a13.\n\nI think the first thing I should do is compute the vector inside the norm. Let me compute that. So, k*(2, -3) is (2k, -3k). Then, subtracting (4, 7) from that would give me (2k - 4, -3k - 7). So, the vector inside the norm is (2k - 4, -3k - 7).\n\nNow, the norm of a vector (a, b) is given by the square root of (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2). So, applying that here, the norm would be sqrt[(2k - 4)\u00b2 + (-3k - 7)\u00b2]. And this is equal to 2\u221a13.\n\nSo, I can set up the equation:\n\nsqrt[(2k - 4)\u00b2 + (-3k - 7)\u00b2] = 2\u221a13.\n\nTo make this easier, I can square both sides of the equation to eliminate the square root. That should give me:\n\n(2k - 4)\u00b2 + (-3k - 7)\u00b2 = (2\u221a13)\u00b2.\n\nCalculating the right side first, (2\u221a13)\u00b2 is 4*13, which is 52. So, the equation becomes:\n\n(2k - 4)\u00b2 + (-3k - 7)\u00b2 = 52.\n\nNow, I need to expand the left side. Let's do each term one by one.\n\nFirst term: (2k - 4)\u00b2. Expanding this, I remember that (a - b)\u00b2 = a\u00b2 - 2ab + b\u00b2. So,\n\n(2k)\u00b2 = 4k\u00b2,\n-2*(2k)*(4) = -16k,\n(4)\u00b2 = 16.\n\nSo, the first term becomes 4k\u00b2 - 16k + 16.\n\nSecond term: (-3k - 7)\u00b2. Again, using the formula (a + b)\u00b2 = a\u00b2 + 2ab + b\u00b2. So,\n\n(-3k)\u00b2 = 9k\u00b2,\n2*(-3k)*(-7) = 42k,\n(-7)\u00b2 = 49.\n\nSo, the second term becomes 9k\u00b2 + 42k + 49.\n\nNow, adding both terms together:\n\n4k\u00b2 - 16k + 16 + 9k\u00b2 + 42k + 49.\n\nLet me combine like terms.\n\nFirst, the k\u00b2 terms: 4k\u00b2 + 9k\u00b2 = 13k\u00b2.\n\nNext, the k terms: -16k + 42k = 26k.\n\nThen, the constants: 16 + 49 = 65.\n\nSo, the left side simplifies to 13k\u00b2 + 26k + 65.\n\nSo now, the equation is:\n\n13k\u00b2 + 26k + 65 = 52.\n\nI need to solve for k, so let's subtract 52 from both sides to set the equation to zero:\n\n13k\u00b2 + 26k + 65 - 52 = 0.\n\nSimplifying 65 - 52 gives 13, so:\n\n13k\u00b2 + 26k + 13 = 0.\n\nHmm, this looks like a quadratic equation in terms of k. Let me write it as:\n\n13k\u00b2 + 26k + 13 = 0.\n\nI can try to factor this, but maybe it's easier to use the quadratic formula. Alternatively, I can notice that all coefficients are multiples of 13, so maybe I can divide through by 13 to simplify.\n\nDividing each term by 13:\n\nk\u00b2 + 2k + 1 = 0.\n\nOh, that's much simpler! So, the equation becomes:\n\nk\u00b2 + 2k + 1 = 0.\n\nWait, that's a perfect square, right? Because (k + 1)\u00b2 = k\u00b2 + 2k + 1. So, this equation factors to:\n\n(k + 1)\u00b2 = 0.\n\nTaking the square root of both sides gives:\n\nk + 1 = 0.\n\nSo, solving for k, we get:\n\nk = -1.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. Let me double-check each step.\n\nStarting from the beginning, I had the vector (2k - 4, -3k - 7). The norm squared is (2k - 4)^2 + (-3k - 7)^2, which I expanded correctly as 4k\u00b2 -16k +16 and 9k\u00b2 +42k +49. Adding these gives 13k\u00b2 +26k +65, which I set equal to 52. Subtracting 52, I get 13k\u00b2 +26k +13 = 0, which simplifies to k\u00b2 +2k +1 = 0, so k = -1. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's only one solution. Since the quadratic equation had a discriminant of b\u00b2 -4ac, which in this case, after dividing by 13, was 1\u00b2 -4*1*1 = 1 -4 = -3, which is negative, but wait, that's not possible because I ended up with a real solution. Wait, that seems contradictory.\n\nWait, no, after dividing by 13, the equation became k\u00b2 +2k +1 =0, which is (k +1)^2=0, which has a double root at k=-1. So, the discriminant in the simplified equation is zero, which means there's exactly one real solution, a double root. So, that makes sense.\n\nWait, but let me go back to before dividing by 13. The equation was 13k\u00b2 +26k +13 =0. The discriminant here is 26^2 -4*13*13 = 676 - 676 = 0. So, same result, a double root at k = (-26)/(2*13) = (-26)/26 = -1. So, that's consistent.\n\nSo, the only solution is k = -1.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that this k indeed satisfies the original equation. Let's plug k = -1 back into the vector expression and compute the norm.\n\nSo, k = -1. Then, the vector is (-1)*(2, -3) - (4,7). Wait, no, the expression is k*(2,-3) - (4,7). So, substituting k = -1, that's (-1)*(2, -3) which is (-2, 3), then subtract (4,7), so (-2 -4, 3 -7) = (-6, -4).\n\nNow, the norm of (-6, -4) is sqrt[(-6)^2 + (-4)^2] = sqrt[36 +16] = sqrt[52] = 2\u221a13. Which matches the right side of the equation. So, yes, that works.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"find all real numbers k\", so is there only one solution? From the quadratic equation, it seems so. So, the only real solution is k = -1.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I make any mistake when expanding the squares? Let me check the expansion again.\n\n(2k -4)^2: 2k squared is 4k\u00b2, cross term is 2*2k*(-4) = -16k, and (-4)^2 is 16. So, 4k\u00b2 -16k +16. That's correct.\n\n(-3k -7)^2: (-3k)^2 is 9k\u00b2, cross term is 2*(-3k)*(-7) = 42k, and (-7)^2 is 49. So, 9k\u00b2 +42k +49. Correct.\n\nAdding together: 4k\u00b2 +9k\u00b2 is 13k\u00b2, -16k +42k is 26k, and 16 +49 is 65. So, 13k\u00b2 +26k +65. Correct.\n\nSet equal to 52, so 13k\u00b2 +26k +13 =0. Correct.\n\nDivide by 13: k\u00b2 +2k +1=0. Correct, which gives k=-1.\n\nSo, yes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but I just thought, sometimes when you square both sides of an equation, you can introduce extraneous solutions. But in this case, since the square root function is always non-negative, and we squared both sides correctly, and we only got one solution, which checks out, so I think that's the only solution.\n\nTherefore, the only real number k that satisfies the equation is k = -1.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe solution is \\boxed{-1}.\n</think>\n\nTo find all real numbers \\( k \\) such that\n\\[\n\\left\\| k \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -3 \\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ 7 \\end{pmatrix} \\right\\| = 2 \\sqrt{13},\n\\]\nwe start by expressing the vector inside the norm. \n\nFirst, compute the vector:\n\\[\nk \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -3 \\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ 7 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2k - 4 \\\\ -3k - 7 \\end{pmatrix}.\n\\]\n\nThe norm of this vector is given by:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(2k - 4)^2 + (-3k - 7)^2}.\n\\]\n\nWe set this equal to \\( 2\\sqrt{13} \\) and square both sides:\n\\[\n(2k - 4)^2 + (-3k - 7)^2 = (2\\sqrt{13})^2 = 52.\n\\]\n\nExpanding the left-hand side:\n\\[\n(2k - 4)^2 = 4k^2 - 16k + 16,\n\\]\n\\[\n(-3k - 7)^2 = 9k^2 + 42k + 49.\n\\]\n\nAdding these together:\n\\[\n4k^2 - 16k + 16 + 9k^2 + 42k + 49 = 13k^2 + 26k + 65.\n\\]\n\nSetting this equal to 52:\n\\[\n13k^2 + 26k + 65 = 52.\n\\]\n\nSubtracting 52 from both sides:\n\\[\n13k^2 + 26k + 13 = 0.\n\\]\n\nDividing by 13:\n\\[\nk^2 + 2k + 1 = 0.\n\\]\n\nThis factors to:\n\\[\n(k + 1)^2 = 0,\n\\]\ngiving the solution:\n\\[\nk = -1.\n\\]\n\nThus, the solution is \\(\\boxed{-1}\\).",
