If $\\operatorname{proj}_{\\mathbf{a}} \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ -3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\frac{3}{5} \\\\ -\\frac{6}{5} \\end{pmatrix},$ then find $\\operatorname{proj}_{\\mathbf{b}} \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ -3 \\end{pmatrix}.$ Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this problem here about projections onto orthogonal vectors. Hmm, let me try to remember what I know about projections and orthogonal vectors. \n\nAlright, the problem says that vectors a and b are orthogonal. That means their dot product is zero, right? So, a \u00b7 b = 0. And we're given the projection of the vector [3, -3] onto a, which is [-3/5, -6/5]. The question is asking for the projection of [3, -3] onto b.\n\nI think I remember that if two vectors are orthogonal, then any vector in the space can be expressed as the sum of its projections onto each of these orthogonal vectors. So, maybe the projection onto a and the projection onto b add up to the original vector? Let me check that.\n\nIf that's the case, then the projection onto b would just be the original vector minus the projection onto a. So, mathematically, that would be:\n\nproj_b(v) = v - proj_a(v)\n\nWhere v is the vector [3, -3]. Let me write that down.\n\nSo, v is [3, -3], and proj_a(v) is [-3/5, -6/5]. Therefore, proj_b(v) should be [3, -3] minus [-3/5, -6/5].\n\nLet me compute that. Subtracting these vectors component-wise:\n\nFirst component: 3 - (-3/5) = 3 + 3/5 = 3 + 0.6 = 3.6, which is 18/5.\n\nSecond component: -3 - (-6/5) = -3 + 6/5 = -3 + 1.2 = -1.8, which is -9/5.\n\nSo, putting that together, proj_b(v) would be [18/5, -9/5]. Let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, 3 is 15/5, so 15/5 + 3/5 is 18/5, that's correct. And -3 is -15/5, so -15/5 + 6/5 is -9/5. Yeah, that looks right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about it in terms of linear algebra. Since a and b are orthogonal, they form a basis for R\u00b2, right? So any vector in R\u00b2 can be expressed as a linear combination of a and b. And the projections onto a and b would give those coefficients, so when you add them together, you get the original vector.\n\nWait, but in this case, we're only given the projection onto a, so to get the projection onto b, we subtract that from the original vector. That makes sense because if you have two orthogonal directions, the original vector is the sum of its components along each orthogonal direction.\n\nLet me also think about the formula for projection. The projection of v onto a is (v \u00b7 a / ||a||\u00b2) * a. But since we don't know a, maybe it's easier to just use the fact that the projections onto orthogonal vectors add up to the original vector.\n\nSo, if I take the original vector [3, -3] and subtract the projection onto a, which is [-3/5, -6/5], I should get the projection onto b.\n\nLet me write that out:\n\nproj_b(v) = v - proj_a(v)\n           = [3, -3] - [-3/5, -6/5]\n           = [3 + 3/5, -3 + 6/5]\n           = [18/5, -9/5]\n\nSo, that's [18/5, -9/5], which is the same as [3.6, -1.8].\n\nWait, let me confirm that 18/5 is 3.6 and -9/5 is -1.8, yes that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check by considering the properties of projections. Since a and b are orthogonal, the projection onto a and the projection onto b should also be orthogonal. Let me check if the given projection onto a and the one I found for b are orthogonal.\n\nThe projection onto a is [-3/5, -6/5], and the projection onto b is [18/5, -9/5].\n\nLet me compute their dot product:\n\n(-3/5)(18/5) + (-6/5)(-9/5) = (-54/25) + (54/25) = 0.\n\nYes, the dot product is zero, so they are orthogonal. That makes sense because projections onto orthogonal vectors should also be orthogonal.\n\nWait, but is that always true? Let me think. If the original vectors a and b are orthogonal, then any projections onto them from the same vector v should also be orthogonal, right? Because the projections themselves lie along a and b, which are orthogonal.\n\nSo, that's a good check. It confirms that my answer is consistent with the properties of orthogonal vectors and projections.\n\nAnother way to think about it is using the projection formula. If a and b are orthogonal, then the projection of v onto a and the projection onto b should add up to v. So, if I add proj_a(v) and proj_b(v), I should get v.\n\nLet me check that:\n\nproj_a(v) + proj_b(v) = [-3/5, -6/5] + [18/5, -9/5] = [(-3 + 18)/5, (-6 -9)/5] = [15/5, -15/5] = [3, -3], which is exactly v. So that works out.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the projection onto b is [18/5, -9/5].\n\nWait, let me just recap to make sure I didn't skip any steps. The problem gives me that a and b are orthogonal vectors, and the projection of [3, -3] onto a is [-3/5, -6/5]. Since a and b are orthogonal, they form a basis, so the projection onto b can be found by subtracting the projection onto a from the original vector. I did that subtraction, got [18/5, -9/5], and then I checked by adding the two projections to get back the original vector, which worked. Also, the projections onto a and b are orthogonal, which is consistent.\n\nI think that's thorough. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the checks make sense. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe projection of the vector onto \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) is \\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\dfrac{18}{5} \\\\ -\\dfrac{9}{5} \\end{pmatrix}}.\n</think>\n\nGiven that vectors \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) are orthogonal, we know that any vector in \\(\\mathbb{R}^2\\) can be expressed as the sum of its projections onto each of these orthogonal vectors. \n\nWe are given the projection of the vector \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ -3 \\end{pmatrix}\\) onto \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) as \\(\\begin{pmatrix} -\\frac{3}{5} \\\\ -\\frac{6}{5} \\end{pmatrix}\\). \n\nTo find the projection of \\(\\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ -3 \\end{pmatrix}\\) onto \\(\\mathbf{b}\\), we use the fact that the original vector is the sum of its projections onto \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{b}\\). Therefore, we subtract the projection onto \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) from the original vector:\n\n\\[\n\\operatorname{proj}_{\\mathbf{b}} \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ -3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ -3 \\end{pmatrix} - \\operatorname{proj}_{\\mathbf{a}} \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ -3 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nPerforming the subtraction component-wise:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ -3 \\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} -\\frac{3}{5} \\\\ -\\frac{6}{5} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3 + \\frac{3}{5} \\\\ -3 + \\frac{6}{5} \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nConverting the components to fractions:\n\n\\[\n3 = \\frac{15}{5} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad -3 = -\\frac{15}{5}\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{15}{5} + \\frac{3}{5} \\\\ -\\frac{15}{5} + \\frac{6}{5} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{18}{5} \\\\ -\\frac{9}{5} \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nThus, the projection of the vector onto \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\dfrac{18}{5} \\\\ -\\dfrac{9}{5} \\end{pmatrix}}\n\\]",
