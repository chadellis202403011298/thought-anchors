Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the distance between the points (0,4) and (3,0). Hmm, I remember from school that there's a formula for this. Let me think. I think it's something like the square root of the sum of the squares of the differences in each coordinate. Yeah, that sounds right. So, I guess it's the distance formula.\n\nWait, let me make sure. The distance formula is derived from the Pythagorean theorem, right? So if I imagine these two points as two corners of a right-angled triangle, the distance between them would be the hypotenuse. That makes sense. So, the formula should be something like sqrt[(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2]. Yeah, that's it.\n\nAlright, let's assign the points. The first point is (0,4), so I'll call that (x1, y1). The second point is (3,0), which will be (x2, y2). So, plugging these into the formula, I get sqrt[(3 - 0)^2 + (0 - 4)^2]. Let me calculate each part step by step.\n\nFirst, the difference in the x-coordinates: 3 - 0 is 3. Then, the difference in the y-coordinates: 0 - 4 is -4. Now, I need to square both of these differences. So, 3 squared is 9, and (-4) squared is 16. \n\nAdding those squared differences together: 9 + 16 equals 25. Now, taking the square root of 25 gives me 5. So, the distance between the two points is 5 units. \n\nWait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with the formula: sqrt[(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2]. Plugging in the values: sqrt[(3 - 0)^2 + (0 - 4)^2] becomes sqrt[9 + 16], which is sqrt[25]. And sqrt[25] is indeed 5. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nI guess another way to think about it is by plotting the points on a graph. The point (0,4) is on the y-axis, four units up. The point (3,0) is on the x-axis, three units to the right. So, the line connecting them would form the hypotenuse of a right triangle where one leg is along the x-axis from (0,0) to (3,0), which is 3 units, and the other leg is along the y-axis from (0,0) to (0,4), which is 4 units. \n\nSo, using the Pythagorean theorem, the distance (hypotenuse) would be sqrt(3^2 + 4^2) = sqrt(9 + 16) = sqrt(25) = 5. Yep, that checks out. So, whether I use the distance formula directly or break it down into the legs of a right triangle, I end up with the same answer.\n\nI don't think I made any calculation errors here. The differences are straightforward, the squaring is correct, and adding them gives me a perfect square, which makes taking the square root easy. If the numbers weren't so neat, maybe I'd have to deal with decimals or something, but in this case, it's a nice whole number.\n\nSo, just to recap: The distance formula is a reliable method for finding the distance between two points in a plane, and it's directly applicable here. By substituting the given coordinates into the formula and carefully performing each arithmetic step, I arrived at the correct answer without any issues.\n</think>\n\nThe distance between the points (0,4) and (3,0) is calculated using the distance formula:\n\n1. **Identify the coordinates**:  \n   (x\u2081, y\u2081) = (0, 4)  \n   (x\u2082, y\u2082) = (3, 0)\n\n2. **Apply the distance formula**:  \n   Distance = \u221a[(x\u2082 - x\u2081)\u00b2 + (y\u2082 - y\u2081)\u00b2]\n\n3. **Calculate the differences**:  \n   (x\u2082 - x\u2081) = 3 - 0 = 3  \n   (y\u2082 - y\u2081) = 0 - 4 = -4\n\n4. **Square the differences**:  \n   3\u00b2 = 9  \n   (-4)\u00b2 = 16\n\n5. **Sum the squares**:  \n   9 + 16 = 25\n\n6. **Take the square root**:  \n   \u221a25 = 5\n\n**Final Answer**:  \nThe distance between the points (0,4) and (3,0) is \\boxed{5}.",
