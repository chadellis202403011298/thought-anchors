Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I need to compute the binomial coefficient, which is written as $\\dbinom{25}{2}$. Hmm, I remember that binomial coefficients are used in combinations, right? Like, choosing 2 items out of 25 without considering the order. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula, so let me think.\n\nI recall that the formula for combinations is $\\dbinom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}$, where \"n!\" stands for the factorial of n. So in this case, n is 25 and k is 2. Let me plug those values into the formula.\n\nSo, substituting the values, we get $\\dbinom{25}{2} = \\frac{25!}{2!(25 - 2)!}$. Simplifying the denominator, that becomes $\\frac{25!}{2! \\times 23!}$. \n\nWait, I remember that factorials can be simplified when the numerator and denominator have common terms. Since 25! is 25 \u00d7 24 \u00d7 23!, right? So the 23! in the numerator and denominator will cancel each other out. That leaves me with $\\frac{25 \u00d7 24}{2!}$. \n\nNow, 2! is just 2 \u00d7 1, which is 2. So the expression simplifies to $\\frac{25 \u00d7 24}{2}$. Let me compute that. 25 multiplied by 24 is... let me do 25 \u00d7 20, which is 500, and 25 \u00d7 4, which is 100, so adding those together gives 600. So now I have 600 divided by 2, which is 300.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So starting from the beginning: $\\dbinom{25}{2}$ is the number of ways to choose 2 items from 25. The formula is correct, and when I expand 25! as 25 \u00d7 24 \u00d7 23!, that cancels with the 23! in the denominator. Then I have 25 \u00d7 24 divided by 2, which is indeed 600 divided by 2, which is 300. \n\nI think that's right. Another way to think about it is, when choosing 2 items, the number of combinations is the same as the number of handshakes if everyone in a group of 25 people shakes hands with each other exactly once. Each handshake is unique and not counted twice, so the formula applies there too. I remember that the handshake problem formula is $\\frac{n(n - 1)}{2}$, which in this case would be $\\frac{25 \u00d7 24}{2}$, which again gives 300. \n\nSo yeah, I'm pretty confident that $\\dbinom{25}{2}$ equals 300.\n</think>\n\nTo compute $\\dbinom{25}{2}$, we use the combination formula:\n\n$\\dbinom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}$\n\nSubstituting $n = 25$ and $k = 2$:\n\n$\\dbinom{25}{2} = \\frac{25!}{2!(25 - 2)!} = \\frac{25!}{2! \\times 23!}$\n\nSimplifying by canceling $23!$:\n\n$\\frac{25 \\times 24 \\times 23!}{2 \\times 1 \\times 23!} = \\frac{25 \\times 24}{2} = \\frac{600}{2} = 300$\n\n**Answer:** $\\boxed{300}$",
