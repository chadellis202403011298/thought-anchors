Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I need to compute the binomial coefficient, which is written as $\\dbinom{5}{3}$. Hmm, I remember that binomial coefficients are related to combinations, like choosing items from a set without considering the order. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula, so let me think.\n\nI think the formula for a binomial coefficient is $\\dbinom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}$, where \"n!\" stands for the factorial of n, which is the product of all positive integers up to n. So, applying this formula to $\\dbinom{5}{3}$, I should plug in n=5 and k=3.\n\nLet me write that down: $\\dbinom{5}{3} = \\frac{5!}{3!(5 - 3)!}$. Simplifying the denominator first, since (5 - 3) is 2, so it becomes $\\frac{5!}{3! \\times 2!}$.\n\nNow, I need to compute each factorial. Let's start with 5!. 5! is 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1, which equals 120. Then, 3! is 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1, which is 6, and 2! is 2 \u00d7 1, which is 2.\n\nSubstituting these back into the equation, we get $\\frac{120}{6 \\times 2}$. Calculating the denominator first, 6 times 2 is 12. So now it's $\\frac{120}{12}$.\n\nDividing 120 by 12, I get 10. So, $\\dbinom{5}{3}$ equals 10.\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Sometimes with factorials, it's easy to miscalculate. So, 5! is definitely 120 because 5\u00d74=20, 20\u00d73=60, 60\u00d72=120, and 120\u00d71=120. 3! is 6, as I thought, and 2! is 2. So 6\u00d72 is 12. 120 divided by 12 is indeed 10. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is using the combination formula, which is about selecting 3 items out of 5 without considering the order. The number of ways to do that should be 10, which matches the result I got. So, I think I did this correctly.\n</think>\n\n$\\dbinom{5}{3}$ is calculated using the formula for combinations:\n\n$\\dbinom{5}{3} = \\frac{5!}{3!(5 - 3)!} = \\frac{120}{6 \\times 2} = \\frac{120}{12} = 10$.\n\n$\\boxed{10}$",
