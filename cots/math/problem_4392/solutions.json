Problem: Let $a,$ $b,$ $c$ be the roots of $3x^3 - 3x^2 + 11x - 8 = 0.$  Find $ab + ac + bc.$ Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this math problem here. It says that a, b, and c are the roots of the cubic equation 3x\u00b3 - 3x\u00b2 + 11x - 8 = 0. I need to find the value of ab + ac + bc. Hmm, alright, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, I remember that for polynomials, especially quadratic ones, there's something called Vieta's formulas that relate the coefficients of the polynomial to the sums and products of its roots. But wait, this is a cubic equation, not a quadratic. Does Vieta's formula still apply here? I think it does, but I'm not entirely sure how. Let me recall.\n\nFor a general cubic equation of the form ax\u00b3 + bx\u00b2 + cx + d = 0, the roots say r, s, t would satisfy certain relationships. Specifically, I think the sum of the roots r + s + t is equal to -b/a, right? And the sum of the products of the roots two at a time, which is rs + rt + st, is equal to c/a. Then the product of all three roots, rst, is -d/a. So yeah, Vieta's formulas extend to cubic equations as well.\n\nIn this problem, the equation is 3x\u00b3 - 3x\u00b2 + 11x - 8 = 0. Let me write down the coefficients clearly: the leading coefficient is 3, then the next is -3, followed by 11, and the constant term is -8. So, comparing this to the general form ax\u00b3 + bx\u00b2 + cx + d = 0, we can see that a = 3, b = -3, c = 11, and d = -8.\n\nNow, the problem is asking for ab + ac + bc, which in the context of the roots, would be the sum of the products of the roots two at a time, right? So that would be rs + rt + st, where r, s, t are the roots. Wait, but in the problem, the roots are named a, b, c. So ab + ac + bc would be the same as rs + rt + st in my earlier notation. So, using Vieta's formula, this sum should be equal to c/a, where c is the coefficient of x in the cubic equation, and a is the leading coefficient.\n\nWait, hold on, let me make sure I'm applying this correctly. In the general cubic equation ax\u00b3 + bx\u00b2 + cx + d = 0, the sum of the products two at a time is indeed c/a. So, in our case, the coefficient c is 11, and a is 3, so ab + ac + bc should be 11/3.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. But let me double-check to make sure I'm not making any mistakes here. Let me go through each step again.\n\n1. The equation is 3x\u00b3 - 3x\u00b2 + 11x - 8 = 0.\n2. The roots are a, b, c.\n3. Using Vieta's formula, for a cubic equation ax\u00b3 + bx\u00b2 + cx + d = 0, the sum of the roots a + b + c = -b/a.\n4. The sum of the products two at a time, ab + ac + bc = c/a.\n5. The product of the roots, abc = -d/a.\n\nSo, applying this to our equation, the sum of the roots a + b + c would be -(-3)/3 = 3/3 = 1. That seems correct.\n\nThe sum of the products two at a time, ab + ac + bc, would be 11/3, as I thought earlier.\n\nAnd the product of the roots, abc, would be -(-8)/3 = 8/3.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not confusing the coefficients. In the general form, it's ax\u00b3 + bx\u00b2 + cx + d = 0, so in our case, the coefficients are:\n\n- a (leading coefficient) = 3\n- b (coefficient of x\u00b2) = -3\n- c (coefficient of x) = 11\n- d (constant term) = -8\n\nSo, yes, ab + ac + bc = c/a = 11/3.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the answer should be 11/3.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me try another approach to confirm this result. Maybe by actually expanding the polynomial from its roots.\n\nIf a, b, c are the roots of the cubic equation, then the equation can be written as 3(x - a)(x - b)(x - c) = 0. Let me expand this and see if I can relate the coefficients to the sums and products.\n\nExpanding (x - a)(x - b)(x - c):\n\nFirst, multiply (x - a)(x - b):\n\n= x\u00b2 - (a + b)x + ab\n\nNow, multiply this by (x - c):\n\n= (x\u00b2 - (a + b)x + ab)(x - c)\n= x\u00b3 - (a + b)x\u00b2 + abx - c x\u00b2 + c(a + b)x - abc\n= x\u00b3 - (a + b + c)x\u00b2 + (ab + ac + bc)x - abc\n\nSo, the expanded form is x\u00b3 - (a + b + c)x\u00b2 + (ab + ac + bc)x - abc.\n\nBut in our given equation, the leading coefficient is 3, so the equation is 3x\u00b3 - 3x\u00b2 + 11x - 8 = 0. Let me factor out the 3 to make it easier to compare:\n\n3(x\u00b3 - x\u00b2 + (11/3)x - 8/3) = 0.\n\nComparing this to the expanded form from the roots:\n\nx\u00b3 - (a + b + c)x\u00b2 + (ab + ac + bc)x - abc\n\nSo, when we factor out the 3, the polynomial becomes:\n\n3x\u00b3 - 3x\u00b2 + 11x - 8 = 0.\n\nWhich matches the given equation if we set:\n\n- The coefficient of x\u00b2: -3 = 3*(-1), so that corresponds to -(a + b + c) = -1, so a + b + c = 1.\n\n- The coefficient of x: 11 = 3*(ab + ac + bc), so ab + ac + bc = 11/3.\n\n- The constant term: -8 = 3*(-abc), so abc = 8/3.\n\nSo, that confirms that ab + ac + bc is indeed 11/3.\n\nWait, so that's consistent with what I got earlier using Vieta's formula directly. So, that must be the correct answer.\n\nJust to recap, the key steps were:\n\n1. Recognize that the problem involves finding the sum of products of roots two at a time for a cubic equation.\n\n2. Recall Vieta's formulas, which relate the coefficients of a polynomial to sums and products of its roots.\n\n3. Apply Vieta's formula to the given cubic equation to find ab + ac + bc, which is c/a, where c is the coefficient of x and a is the leading coefficient.\n\n4. Double-check by expanding the polynomial from its roots and comparing coefficients, which confirmed the result.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning, and both methods gave me the same answer, so I'm confident that ab + ac + bc is 11/3.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of \\( ab + ac + bc \\) is \\boxed{\\dfrac{11}{3}}.\n</think>\n\nGiven the cubic equation \\(3x^3 - 3x^2 + 11x - 8 = 0\\) with roots \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\), we need to find the value of \\(ab + ac + bc\\).\n\n1. **Identify the coefficients**: The given polynomial is \\(3x^3 - 3x^2 + 11x - 8 = 0\\).

The expanded form of \\(3(x - a)(x - b)(x - c)\\) matches the given polynomial, confirming that the sum of the products of the roots taken two at a time is indeed \\(\\frac{11}{3}\\).\n\nThus, the value of \\(ab + ac + bc\\) is \\(\\boxed{\\dfrac{11}{3}}\\).",
