Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this math problem here: (4^4 \u00f7 4^3) \u00b7 2^8. Hmm, let me see how to tackle this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on exponents, but I'll try to remember the rules.\n\nFirst, I notice that the expression has two main parts: the division part, which is 4^4 divided by 4^3, and then that result is multiplied by 2^8. Maybe I can simplify each part separately before combining them.\n\nStarting with the division part: 4^4 \u00f7 4^3. I remember that when you divide exponents with the same base, you subtract the exponents. So, 4^(4-3) which is 4^1, right? And 4^1 is just 4. So, that simplifies nicely to 4.\n\nNow, the problem becomes 4 multiplied by 2^8. Let me write that down: 4 \u00b7 2^8. I need to compute 2^8 first. I think 2^8 is 256 because 2^10 is 1024, so 2^8 should be 256. Let me check: 2^1=2, 2^2=4, 2^3=8, 2^4=16, 2^5=32, 2^6=64, 2^7=128, 2^8=256. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo now, the problem is 4 \u00b7 256. Let me calculate that. 4 times 200 is 800, and 4 times 56 is 224, so adding those together, 800 + 224 is 1024. Wait, that can't be right because 4 times 256 is 1024? Let me verify: 256 times 4. 200*4=800, 50*4=200, 6*4=24, so 800+200=1000, plus 24 is 1024. Yeah, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe there's a way to simplify this using exponents instead of multiplying directly. So, 4 is the same as 2^2 because 2*2=4. So, 4 \u00b7 2^8 can be written as 2^2 \u00b7 2^8. When you multiply exponents with the same base, you add the exponents. So, 2^(2+8) = 2^10. And 2^10 is 1024, which matches what I got earlier. So that's another way to confirm the answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach the original problem differently. Let's see: (4^4 \u00f7 4^3) \u00b7 2^8. Since 4^4 \u00f7 4^3 is 4, as I found before, and then 4 is 2^2, so the expression becomes 2^2 \u00b7 2^8 = 2^(2+8) = 2^10 = 1024.\n\nWait, but let me check if I did everything correctly. Sometimes, I might make a mistake in the exponent rules. So, 4^4 is 256, because 4*4=16, 16*4=64, 64*4=256. And 4^3 is 64, because 4*4=16, 16*4=64. So, 256 divided by 64 is 4, which is correct. Then, 4 times 256 is indeed 1024.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to express everything in terms of base 2. Since 4 is 2^2, then 4^4 is (2^2)^4, which is 2^(2*4) = 2^8. Similarly, 4^3 is (2^2)^3 = 2^(2*3) = 2^6. So, 4^4 \u00f7 4^3 becomes 2^8 \u00f7 2^6, which is 2^(8-6) = 2^2 = 4. Then, 4 is 2^2, so when you multiply by 2^8, it's 2^2 * 2^8 = 2^(2+8) = 2^10 = 1024. Yep, that's consistent.\n\nWait, so maybe I can see this as all in terms of base 2 from the start. Let's try that approach. The original problem is (4^4 \u00f7 4^3) \u00b7 2^8. Since 4 is 2^2, substitute that in:\n\n( (2^2)^4 \u00f7 (2^2)^3 ) \u00b7 2^8.\n\nSimplify the exponents:\n\n(2^(2*4) \u00f7 2^(2*3)) \u00b7 2^8 = (2^8 \u00f7 2^6) \u00b7 2^8.\n\nNow, 2^8 \u00f7 2^6 is 2^(8-6) = 2^2. So, now the expression is 2^2 \u00b7 2^8 = 2^(2+8) = 2^10 = 1024.\n\nThat's the same result as before, so that's good. It seems like no matter how I approach it, the answer is 1024.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the substitution. 4 is indeed 2^2, right? Because 2*2=4. So, yes, substituting 2^2 for 4 is correct.\n\nAnother check: Let's compute each part numerically without using exponents. 4^4 is 256, as we saw earlier, and 4^3 is 64. So, 256 \u00f7 64 is 4. Then, 2^8 is 256. So, 4 * 256 is 1024. Yep, that's correct.\n\nI think I'm confident that the answer is 1024. I've checked it using multiple methods: simplifying the exponents first, breaking down into base 2, and direct numerical computation. All methods lead to the same result. So, I don't think I made any mistakes here.\n\nJust to recap:\n\n1. Simplify the division part: 4^4 \u00f7 4^3 = 4^(4-3) = 4^1 = 4.\n2. Multiply by 2^8: 4 * 256 = 1024.\n3. Alternatively, express everything in base 2:\n   - 4^4 = (2^2)^4 = 2^8\n   - 4^3 = (2^2)^3 = 2^6\n   - So, 4^4 \u00f7 4^3 = 2^8 \u00f7 2^6 = 2^2\n   - Then, 2^2 * 2^8 = 2^10 = 1024.\n\nAll paths lead to 1024, so I'm pretty sure that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to compute (4^4 \u00f7 4^3) \u00b7 2^8.\n\n1. **Simplify the division of exponents with the same base:**\n   - 4^4 \u00f7 4^3 = 4^(4-3) = 4^1 = 4.\n\n2. **Multiply the result by 2^8:**\n   - 4 \u00b7 2^8 = 4 \u00b7 256 = 1024.\n\n3. **Alternative approach using base 2:**\n   - Express 4 as 2^2.\n   - (2^2)^4 \u00f7 (2^2)^3 = 2^8 \u00f7 2^6 = 2^2.\n   - 2^2 \u00b7 2^8 = 2^(2+8) = 2^10 = 1024.\n\n**Final Answer:** 1024\n\n\\boxed{1024}",
