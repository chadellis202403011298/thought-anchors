Problem: Determine the sum of all single-digit replacements for $z$ such that the number ${24{,}z38}$ is divisible by 6. Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the sum of all single-digit replacements for z such that the number 24,z38 is divisible by 6. Hmm, let me start by recalling the rules for divisibility by 6. I remember that a number is divisible by 6 if and only if it's divisible by both 2 and 3. So, I should check the conditions for divisibility by 2 and by 3 separately.\n\nFirst, let's consider the divisibility by 2. For a number to be divisible by 2, its last digit must be even. Looking at the number 24,z38, the last digit is 8, which is already even. So, regardless of what z is, the number will always end with an 8, which means it will always be divisible by 2. That part is taken care of, so I don't need to worry about z affecting the divisibility by 2. But wait, no, actually, z is in the hundreds place, right? Let me make sure I'm looking at the number correctly. The number is 24,z38, so the digits are: 2 (ten thousands place), 4 (thousands place), z (hundreds place), 3 (tens place), and 8 (units place). So yes, the last digit is 8, which is even, so the number is divisible by 2 no matter what z is. So, the only condition I need to check is whether the number is divisible by 3.\n\nNow, moving on to divisibility by 3. I remember that a number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is a multiple of 3. So, I need to calculate the sum of all the digits of 24,z38 and then find the values of z (which is a single digit, from 0 to 9) that make this sum divisible by 3.\n\nLet me write down the digits: 2, 4, z, 3, 8. So, the sum S of the digits is 2 + 4 + z + 3 + 8. Let me compute the known digits first: 2 + 4 is 6, 6 + 3 is 9, 9 + 8 is 17. So, S = 17 + z. Now, for the entire number to be divisible by 3, S must be a multiple of 3. So, 17 + z must be divisible by 3.\n\nNow, I need to find all single-digit values of z (0 through 9) such that when added to 17, the result is a multiple of 3. Let me think about how to approach this. One way is to find the remainder when 17 is divided by 3, and then determine what z needs to be to make the total sum a multiple of 3.\n\nCalculating 17 divided by 3: 3 times 5 is 15, which is less than 17, and 3 times 6 is 18, which is more than 17. So, 17 divided by 3 is 5 with a remainder of 2, because 3*5=15, and 17-15=2. So, 17 \u2261 2 mod 3.\n\nTherefore, 17 + z \u2261 2 + z mod 3. We want 2 + z \u2261 0 mod 3, which means that z \u2261 -2 mod 3, but since we're dealing with positive digits, -2 mod 3 is the same as 1 mod 3 because 3 - 2 = 1. So, z must be congruent to 1 modulo 3. That is, z \u2261 1 mod 3.\n\nNow, let's list all single-digit numbers (0 through 9) that satisfy z \u2261 1 mod 3. The numbers are: 1, 4, 7. Because 1 divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 1, 4 divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 1 (since 3*1=3, 4-3=1), and 7 divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 1 (3*2=6, 7-6=1). The next number would be 10, but that's not a single digit, so we stop at 7.\n\nSo, the possible values for z are 1, 4, and 7. Now, the problem asks for the sum of all such single-digit replacements. So, I need to add these numbers together: 1 + 4 + 7.\n\nLet me compute that: 1 + 4 is 5, and 5 + 7 is 12. So, the sum is 12.\n\nWait, let me double-check my work to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, the divisibility by 2: the last digit is 8, which is even, so that's correct. Then, the sum of the digits without z is 2 + 4 + 3 + 8 = 17. So, 17 + z must be divisible by 3. 17 divided by 3 is 5 with a remainder of 2, so z must be 1, 4, or 7. Adding those gives 12. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, I can test each possible z from 0 to 9 and see which ones make the total digit sum divisible by 3.\n\nLet me try z=0: 17 + 0 = 17. 17 divided by 3 is 5 with a remainder of 2, so not divisible by 3.\n\nz=1: 17 + 1 = 18. 18 is divisible by 3 (3*6=18), so z=1 works.\n\nz=2: 17 + 2 = 19. 19 divided by 3 is 6 with remainder 1, so no.\n\nz=3: 17 + 3 = 20. 20 divided by 3 is 6 with remainder 2, so no.\n\nz=4: 17 + 4 = 21. 21 is divisible by 3 (3*7=21), so z=4 works.\n\nz=5: 17 + 5 = 22. 22 divided by 3 is 7 with remainder 1, so no.\n\nz=6: 17 + 6 = 23. 23 divided by 3 is 7 with remainder 2, so no.\n\nz=7: 17 + 7 = 24. 24 is divisible by 3 (3*8=24), so z=7 works.\n\nz=8: 17 + 8 = 25. 25 divided by 3 is 8 with remainder 1, so no.\n\nz=9: 17 + 9 = 26. 26 divided by 3 is 8 with remainder 2, so no.\n\nSo, indeed, only z=1, 4, and 7 work, and their sum is 1+4+7=12. Therefore, the answer should be 12.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, the sum of all single-digit replacements for z is 12.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe sum of all single-digit replacements for \\( z \\) is \\boxed{12}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the sum of all single-digit replacements for \\( z \\) such that the number \\( 24{,}z38 \\) is divisible by 6, we need to check the conditions for divisibility by both 2 and 3.\n\n1. **Divisibility by 2**: The last digit of the number is 8, which is even.
