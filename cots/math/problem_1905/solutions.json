What is the probability that their product is odd? Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this math problem here: \"Suppose two distinct integers are chosen from between 5 and 17, inclusive. What is the probability that their product is odd?\" Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the problem. We're choosing two different numbers from the integers 5 to 17, and we want to know the probability that when we multiply these two numbers together, the result is odd. Probability is usually the number of successful outcomes over the total number of possible outcomes, so I think I need to find how many pairs of numbers result in an odd product and then divide that by the total number of possible pairs.\n\nLet me start by figuring out how many integers are there from 5 to 17, inclusive. To do that, I can subtract 5 from 17 and add 1 because both endpoints are included. So, 17 - 5 = 12, and adding 1 gives me 13 numbers in total. Let me list them out to be sure: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17. Yep, that's 13 numbers.\n\nNow, since we're choosing two distinct integers, the total number of possible pairs can be found using combinations because the order doesn't matter. The formula for combinations is n choose k, which is n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number we want to choose. Here, n is 13 and k is 2. So, let's calculate that.\n\n13 choose 2 is 13! / (2!(13 - 2)!) = (13 \u00d7 12 \u00d7 11! ) / (2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 11!) = (13 \u00d7 12) / 2 = 156 / 2 = 78. So, there are 78 possible pairs of numbers we can choose.\n\nNext, I need to find how many of these pairs will result in an odd product. I remember that when multiplying two numbers, the product is odd only if both numbers are odd. If even one of them is even, the product becomes even. So, the key here is to find how many pairs consist of two odd numbers.\n\nLet me first figure out how many odd numbers are there between 5 and 17. Let's list them out: 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17. Hmm, that's 7 numbers. Let me count again to make sure I didn't miss any: 5 is odd, 6 even, 7 odd, 8 even, 9 odd, 10 even, 11 odd, 12 even, 13 odd, 14 even, 15 odd, 16 even, 17 odd. Yep, that's 7 odd numbers.\n\nSo, there are 7 odd numbers. The number of ways to choose 2 distinct odd numbers from these 7 is 7 choose 2. Let me compute that: 7! / (2!(7 - 2)!) = (7 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 5!) / (2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 5!) = (7 \u00d7 6) / 2 = 42 / 2 = 21. So, there are 21 successful pairs where both numbers are odd, resulting in an odd product.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the product is odd is the number of successful outcomes (21) divided by the total number of possible outcomes (78). So, the probability is 21/78.\n\nWait, I think I can simplify that fraction. Both 21 and 78 are divisible by 3. Let's divide numerator and denominator by 3: 21 \u00f7 3 = 7, and 78 \u00f7 3 = 26. So, the simplified probability is 7/26.\n\nLet me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, total numbers from 5 to 17 inclusive: 13 numbers. Total pairs: 78. Number of odd numbers: 7. Pairs of odd numbers: 21. Probability: 21/78 simplifies to 7/26. That seems correct.\n\nI can also think about it another way to verify. The probability that the first number chosen is odd is 7/13. Then, given that the first number was odd, the probability that the second number is also odd is 6/12, which simplifies to 1/2, because we've already chosen one odd number, leaving 6 odd numbers out of the remaining 12. So, the probability would be 7/13 * 6/12 = 7/13 * 1/2 = 7/26. Yep, that matches what I got earlier. So, I think I'm confident that 7/26 is the correct probability.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe probability that their product is odd is \\boxed{\\dfrac{7}{26}}.\n</think>\n\nFirst, we determine the total number of integers from 5 to 17, inclusive. This range includes 13 numbers: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17.\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of ways to choose 2 distinct integers from these 13 numbers using combinations:\n\\[\n\\binom{13}{2} = \\frac{13 \\times 12}{2 \\times 1} = 78\n\\]\n\nWe then identify the odd numbers within this range: 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17. There are 7 odd numbers.\n\nThe number of ways to choose 2 distinct odd numbers from these 7 is:\n\\[\n\\binom{7}{2} = \\frac{7 \\times 6}{2 \\times 1} = 21\n\\]\n\nThe probability that the product of two chosen numbers is odd is the number of successful outcomes (pairs of odd numbers) divided by the total number of possible outcomes:\n\\[\n\\frac{21}{78} = \\frac{7}{26}\n\\]\n\nThus, the probability that their product is odd is \\boxed{\\dfrac{7}{26}}.",
