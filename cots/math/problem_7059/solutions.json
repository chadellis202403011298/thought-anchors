Problem: Find $\\tan \\frac{9 \\pi}{4}.$ Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the value of tan(9\u03c0/4). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that the tangent function has a period of \u03c0, which means that tan(\u03b8) = tan(\u03b8 + k\u03c0) for any integer k. So, maybe I can subtract multiples of \u03c0 from 9\u03c0/4 until I get an angle that's easier to work with, like one within the first \u03c0 radians or something.\n\nLet me write down the angle: 9\u03c0/4. Hmm, let's see. Since the period is \u03c0, subtracting \u03c0 (which is 4\u03c0/4) from 9\u03c0/4 would give me 5\u03c0/4. Wait, but 5\u03c0/4 is still more than \u03c0, right? Because \u03c0 is 4\u03c0/4, so 5\u03c0/4 is \u03c0/4 more than \u03c0. So maybe I can subtract another \u03c0, which is 4\u03c0/4, from 5\u03c0/4, giving me 5\u03c0/4 - 4\u03c0/4 = \u03c0/4. So, tan(9\u03c0/4) should be equal to tan(\u03c0/4), because we subtracted \u03c0 twice, which is 2\u03c0, but wait, the period is \u03c0, so subtracting \u03c0 once would be enough, but maybe I did it twice by mistake.\n\nWait, let me check that again. 9\u03c0/4 minus \u03c0 is 9\u03c0/4 - 4\u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. But 5\u03c0/4 is in the third quadrant, right? Because \u03c0 is 4\u03c0/4, so 5\u03c0/4 is \u03c0/4 beyond \u03c0. Now, the tangent function is positive in the third quadrant because both sine and cosine are negative there, and their ratio would be positive. So, tan(5\u03c0/4) is positive. But I also know that tan(5\u03c0/4) is equal to tan(\u03c0/4) because 5\u03c0/4 is \u03c0/4 more than \u03c0, and the period is \u03c0, so adding \u03c0 doesn't change the value.\n\nWait, but tan(\u03c0/4) is 1, right? Because at \u03c0/4, both sine and cosine are \u221a2/2, so their ratio is 1. So, does that mean tan(5\u03c0/4) is also 1? Hmm, but wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of 9\u03c0/4 as being more than 2\u03c0. Let me calculate 9\u03c0/4 divided by 2\u03c0 to see how many full rotations that is. 9\u03c0/4 divided by 2\u03c0 is (9\u03c0/4) / (8\u03c0/4) = 9/8, which is 1 and 1/8. So, that's more than one full rotation. So, maybe I can subtract 2\u03c0 from 9\u03c0/4 to get an angle within 0 to 2\u03c0.\n\n2\u03c0 is 8\u03c0/4, so 9\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = \u03c0/4. So, tan(9\u03c0/4) is the same as tan(\u03c0/4), which is 1. Wait, that seems straightforward. So, maybe I didn't need to go through 5\u03c0/4 at all. Just subtracting 2\u03c0 once gets me to \u03c0/4, which is a standard angle.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought about subtracting \u03c0 twice, which would be subtracting 2\u03c0, but I thought maybe I was making a mistake. But it seems that both methods lead me to the same result, that tan(9\u03c0/4) is 1.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with another approach. Maybe using the unit circle. On the unit circle, angles are measured from the positive x-axis. So, 9\u03c0/4 is the same as 2\u03c0 + \u03c0/4, which is one full rotation plus \u03c0/4. So, the point on the unit circle at 9\u03c0/4 is the same as at \u03c0/4, which is (\u221a2/2, \u221a2/2). Therefore, tan(9\u03c0/4) is y/x, which is (\u221a2/2)/(\u221a2/2) = 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the periodicity formula. Since tan has a period of \u03c0, tan(\u03b8) = tan(\u03b8 + k\u03c0) where k is any integer. So, 9\u03c0/4 can be written as \u03c0/4 + 2\u03c0, which is \u03c0/4 + 2*(\u03c0). But since 2\u03c0 is a multiple of \u03c0, tan(9\u03c0/4) = tan(\u03c0/4) = 1.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought about subtracting \u03c0 once to get 5\u03c0/4, which is in the third quadrant, but that's still the same as tan(\u03c0/4) because of periodicity. So, maybe both ways are correct, but the simplest way is to subtract 2\u03c0 and get \u03c0/4, so tan(9\u03c0/4) is 1.\n\nI think I've got it. So, the answer should be 1.\n</think>\n\nTo find tan(9\u03c0/4), we can use the periodicity of the tangent function, which has a period of \u03c0. \n\n1. Subtract 2\u03c0 (which is 8\u03c0/4) from 9\u03c0/4 to find an equivalent angle within the first rotation:\n   9\u03c0/4 - 8\u03c0/4 = \u03c0/4.\n\n2. Since tan(\u03c0/4) is known to be 1, we have:\n   tan(9\u03c0/4) = tan(\u03c0/4) = 1.\n\n**Answer:** The value of tan(9\u03c0/4) is \\boxed{1}.",
