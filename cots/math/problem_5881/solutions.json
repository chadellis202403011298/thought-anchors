Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to round 54.\\overline{54} to the nearest hundredth. Hmm, let me start by understanding what this notation means. The bar over the 54 indicates that those two digits repeat indefinitely, right? So, the number is 54.54545454... and it goes on forever. Got it.\n\nNow, the problem is asking me to round this number to the nearest hundredth. I remember that when rounding, we look at the digit in the place we're rounding to and the next digit to decide whether to round up or stay the same. The hundredth place is the second digit after the decimal point. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me write out the number to make it clearer. 54.\\overline{54} is 54.54545454... So, the digits after the decimal are 5, 4, 5, 4, and so on. Since I'm rounding to the nearest hundredth, I need to focus on the first two digits after the decimal point, which are 5 and 4. That is, the number is 54.54... So, the hundredth place is the second 4, right?\n\nWait, no, actually, I think I made a mistake there. Let me correct that. The first digit after the decimal is the tenths place, the second is the hundredths place, the third is the thousandths, and so on. So, in 54.545454..., the tenths place is 5, the hundredths place is 4, the thousandths place is 5, and the ten-thousandths place is 4, etc.\n\nSo, when rounding to the nearest hundredth, I look at the hundredths place (which is 4) and the next digit, which is the thousandths place (which is 5). The rule is, if the digit after the place we're rounding to is 5 or higher, we round up the hundredths place by one. If it's less than 5, we leave it as it is.\n\nIn this case, the thousandths place is 5, which is exactly the threshold. So, according to the rounding rules, I should round up the hundredths place from 4 to 5. Therefore, the number 54.545454... rounded to the nearest hundredth becomes 54.55.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check that. So, the number is 54.545454... When rounding to the nearest hundredth, I look at the third decimal place to decide. The third decimal is 5, so yes, I round up the second decimal place from 4 to 5. So, 54.54 becomes 54.55 when rounded to the nearest hundredth.\n\nI think that's correct. But just to be thorough, let me consider what the number looks like around the hundredth place. The number is 54.545454... So, the exact value is just a bit more than 54.54 because the next digit is 5, which is significant enough to push the hundredth place up by one. So, yes, rounding up to 54.55 makes sense.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the number line. The number 54.545454... is exactly halfway between 54.54 and 54.55. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Actually, 54.545 is halfway between 54.54 and 54.55. But in this case, the number is 54.545454..., which is just a bit more than 54.545. So, it's actually closer to 54.55 than to 54.54. Therefore, when rounding to the nearest hundredth, it makes sense to round up to 54.55.\n\nWait, but hold on, the standard rounding rule is that if the digit after the place we're rounding to is 5 or more, we round up. So, regardless of whether it's exactly halfway or more, we round up. So, in this case, since the third decimal is 5, we round up the second decimal from 4 to 5, resulting in 54.55.\n\nI think that's the correct approach. Let me summarize the steps to make sure I didn't miss anything:\n\n1. Identify the place we're rounding to: the hundredth place, which is the second decimal digit.\n2. Look at the next digit (the thousandth place) to determine rounding.\n3. If the next digit is 5 or higher, round up the hundredth place by one.\n4. If it's less than 5, leave the hundredth place as it is.\n\nApplying this to 54.545454...:\n\n- The hundredth place is 4.\n- The next digit is 5, which is equal to 5.\n- Therefore, we round up the hundredth place from 4 to 5.\n\nSo, the rounded number is 54.55.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, the final answer should be 54.55.\n</think>\n\nTo round \\(54.\\overline{54}\\) to the nearest hundredth, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Number**: Recognize that \\(54.\\overline{54}\\) is \\(54.54545454...\\).\n\n2. **Identify the Hundredth Place**: The hundredth place is the second digit after the decimal, which is 4.\n\n3. **Look at the Next Digit**: The digit immediately after the hundredth place is the thousandth place, which is 5.\n\n4. **Apply Rounding Rule**: Since the thousandth place is 5, we round the hundredth place up by 1.\n\n5. **Adjust the Number**: Increasing the hundredth place from 4 to 5 gives \\(54.55\\).\n\n**Final Answer**: \\(\\boxed{54.55}\\)",
