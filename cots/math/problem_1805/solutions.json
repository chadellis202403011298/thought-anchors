Problem: How many different positive integers can be represented as a difference of two distinct members of the set $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 \\}$? Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this math problem here: \"How many different positive integers can be represented as a difference of two distinct members of the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}?\" Alright, let's try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with these kinds of problems, but I'll give it a shot.\n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. We have the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, and we need to find how many different positive integers can be obtained by subtracting two distinct numbers from this set. So, basically, for any two different numbers a and b in the set, where a > b, we calculate a - b, and then we count how many unique positive results we get.\n\nAlright, so the first thing that comes to mind is that since we're dealing with differences, the maximum possible difference would be when we subtract the smallest number from the largest one. In this case, that would be 6 - 1 = 5. So, the differences can range from 1 up to 5. But wait, is that the case? Let me check.\n\nWait, actually, let's list out all possible differences to make sure. Maybe I can create a table or something to visualize this better. So, let's list all possible pairs where the first number is larger than the second, and then compute their differences.\n\nLet's start with 1 as the smaller number. The numbers larger than 1 in the set are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. So, subtracting 1 from each:\n\n2 - 1 = 1\n3 - 1 = 2\n4 - 1 = 3\n5 - 1 = 4\n6 - 1 = 5\n\nSo, from 1, we get differences of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.\n\nNext, let's take 2 as the smaller number. The numbers larger than 2 are 3, 4, 5, 6. Subtracting 2 from each:\n\n3 - 2 = 1\n4 - 2 = 2\n5 - 2 = 3\n6 - 2 = 4\n\nSo, from 2, we get differences of 1, 2, 3, 4.\n\nWait, but we already have these differences from the previous step, so maybe some duplicates here.\n\nMoving on, let's take 3 as the smaller number. The numbers larger than 3 are 4, 5, 6. Subtracting 3 from each:\n\n4 - 3 = 1\n5 - 3 = 2\n6 - 3 = 3\n\nSo, differences are 1, 2, 3. Again, these are duplicates of what we've already found.\n\nNext, 4 as the smaller number. The numbers larger than 4 are 5, 6. Subtracting 4:\n\n5 - 4 = 1\n6 - 4 = 2\n\nDifferences are 1 and 2, which we've already seen.\n\nThen, 5 as the smaller number. The only number larger than 5 is 6. Subtracting 5:\n\n6 - 5 = 1\n\nSo, difference is 1, which is already accounted for.\n\nFinally, 6 is the largest number, so there are no numbers larger than 6 in the set, so no differences here.\n\nWait a second, so when I list all these differences, I get 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 from the first step, and then 1, 2, 3, 4 from the second, and so on, but all the subsequent ones are just repeating the lower numbers. So, does that mean the unique positive differences are just 1, 2, 3, 4, 5? That would be five different positive integers.\n\nBut wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check because sometimes in these problems, you might miss some differences if you don't consider all possible pairs. Maybe I should list all possible pairs and their differences to be thorough.\n\nSo, let's list all possible pairs (a, b) where a > b, and compute a - b each time. The set has 6 elements, so the number of such pairs is C(6,2) = 15. Let's list them:\n\n1. (2,1): 2 - 1 = 1\n2. (3,1): 3 - 1 = 2\n3. (3,2): 3 - 2 = 1\n4. (4,1): 4 - 1 = 3\n5. (4,2): 4 - 2 = 2\n6. (4,3): 4 - 3 = 1\n7. (5,1): 5 - 1 = 4\n8. (5,2): 5 - 2 = 3\n9. (5,3): 5 - 3 = 2\n10. (5,4): 5 - 4 = 1\n11. (6,1): 6 - 1 = 5\n12. (6,2): 6 - 2 = 4\n13. (6,3): 6 - 3 = 3\n14. (6,4): 6 - 4 = 2\n15. (6,5): 6 - 5 = 1\n\nNow, let's list all the differences we've got:\n\n1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 4, 3, 2, 1, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.\n\nNow, let's collect the unique differences. So, looking through the list, the differences are:\n\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5.\n\nSo, that's five different positive integers. So, the answer should be 5.\n\nWait, but I feel like I might be missing something. Let me think again. Is there a way to get a difference larger than 5? Well, the largest number is 6, and the smallest is 1, so 6 - 1 = 5, which is the maximum possible difference. So, that's correct.\n\nBut wait, let me check if all differences from 1 to 5 are indeed achievable.\n\n1: Yes, as we saw, multiple times.\n\n2: Yes, like 3 - 1, 4 - 2, etc.\n\n3: Yes, 4 - 1, 5 - 2, etc.\n\n4: Yes, 5 - 1, 6 - 2.\n\n5: Yes, 6 - 1.\n\nSo, all differences from 1 to 5 are achievable, and there's no way to get a difference of 6 because the set only goes up to 6, and 6 - 0 isn't allowed since 0 isn't in the set. So, the maximum difference is 5.\n\nWait, but hold on a moment. Let me think about another approach. Maybe using the concept of the range of differences in a set.\n\nIn a set of consecutive integers, the number of possible differences is equal to the maximum difference, which in this case is 5, so the number of positive differences would be 5. But wait, is that always the case?\n\nWait, let me think again. For the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, which is a set of consecutive integers starting at 1, the possible differences are from 1 up to n-1, where n is the number of elements. Wait, n here is 6, so n-1 is 5, which matches our earlier result. So, that seems to confirm that there are 5 different positive differences.\n\nBut wait, another way to think about it: the set has numbers from 1 to 6. The possible differences are the numbers from 1 up to 5 because the maximum difference is 6 - 1 = 5. So, that gives us 5 different positive integers.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that every number between 1 and 5 is actually achievable. Let's check each:\n\n1: 2 - 1 = 1\n\n2: 3 - 1 = 2\n\n3: 4 - 1 = 3\n\n4: 5 - 1 = 4\n\n5: 6 - 1 = 5\n\nYes, each of these is achievable. So, that means all the differences from 1 to 5 are possible, and there are 5 of them.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you have non-consecutive numbers, you might not get all the differences. But in this case, the set is consecutive, so I think it's safe to assume that all differences from 1 to 5 are possible.\n\nLet me try another approach. Maybe using a number line. If I plot the numbers 1 through 6 on a number line, the distance between any two consecutive numbers is 1, so the differences of 1 are achievable. Then, the next distance is 2, which can be achieved by skipping one number, like from 1 to 3, which is 2 units apart. Similarly, 3 can be achieved by skipping two numbers, like 1 to 4, which is 3 units apart. 4 can be achieved by 1 to 5, which is 4 units, and 5 by 1 to 6, which is 5 units. So, that's consistent.\n\nWait, but what about differences like 2, 3, etc., using other pairs? For example, 3 - 1 = 2, 4 - 2 = 2, 5 - 3 = 2, 6 - 4 = 2. So, 2 is achievable in multiple ways, but it's still just one unique difference.\n\nSimilarly, 3 can be achieved by 4 - 1, 5 - 2, 6 - 3. So, again, multiple ways but only one unique difference.\n\nSame with 4: 5 - 1, 6 - 2.\n\nAnd 5: 6 - 1.\n\nSo, yeah, all these differences are covered.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing any other differences. For example, could there be a difference of 6? Well, since the set goes up to 6, the largest possible difference is 6 - 1 = 5, so 6 is not possible. So, the maximum difference is 5, and the minimum is 1, so the possible differences are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.\n\nTherefore, the number of different positive integers that can be represented as a difference is 5.\n\nWait, but just to be absolutely thorough, let me list all the differences again and see if I get anything beyond 1 to 5.\n\nLooking back at the list I made earlier:\n\nDifferences are: 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 4, 3, 2, 1, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.\n\nSo, the unique ones are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. No other numbers appear. So, that's five unique positive integers.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 5. So, the number of different positive integers is 5.\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me think about another angle. Suppose the set wasn't consecutive. For example, if the set was {1, 3, 5, 7}, then the differences would be 2, 4, 6, etc. But in our case, the set is consecutive, so the differences are consecutive from 1 up to 5.\n\nSo, in our problem, since the set is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, which is consecutive, the differences will cover every integer from 1 up to the maximum difference, which is 5. So, that gives us 5 different positive integers.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, I'm pretty confident now that the answer is 5.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of different positive integers is \\boxed{5}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many different positive integers can be represented as a difference of two distinct members of the set \\(\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}\\), we need to consider all possible pairs \\((a, b)\\) where \\(a > b\\) and calculate \\(a - b\\).\n\nFirst, we list all possible pairs and their differences:\n\n1. \\((2, 1)\\): \\(2 - 1 = 1\\)\n2. \\((3, 1)\\): \\(3 - 1 = 2\\)\n3. \\((3, 2)\\): \\(3 - 2 = 1\\)\n4. \\((4, 1)\\): \\(4 - 1 = 3\\)\n5. \\((4, 2)\\): \\(4 - 2 = 2\\)\n6. \\((4, 3)\\): \\(4 - 3 = 1\\)\n7. \\((5, 1)\\): \\(5 - 1 = 4\\)\n8. \\((5, 2)\\): \\(5 - 2 = 3\\)\n9. \\((5, 3)\\): \\(5 - 3 = 2\\)\n10. \\((5, 4)\\): \\(5 - 4 = 1\\)\n11. \\((6, 1)\\): \\(6 - 1 = 5\\)\n12. \\((6, 2)\\): \\(6 - 2 = 4\\)\n13. \\((6, 3)\\): \\(6 - 3 = 3\\)\n14. \\((6, 4)\\): \\(6 - 4 = 2\\)\n15. \\((6, 5)\\): \\(6 - 5 = 1\\)\n\nNext, we collect the unique differences from the list above: \\(1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\).\n\nThus, the number of different positive integers that can be represented as a difference of two distinct members of the set is \\(\\boxed{5}\\).",
