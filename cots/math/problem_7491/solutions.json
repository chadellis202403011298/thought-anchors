Problem: Find the smallest positive integer $k$ such that $\nz^{10} + z^9 + z^6+z^5+z^4+z+1\n$ divides $z^k-1$. Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the smallest positive integer \\( k \\) such that the polynomial \\( P(z) = z^{10} + z^9 + z^6 + z^5 + z^4 + z + 1 \\) divides \\( z^k - 1 \\). Hmm, that means \\( P(z) \\) is a factor of \\( z^k - 1 \\), right? So, \\( z^k - 1 \\) must be a multiple of \\( P(z) \\).\n\nFirst, I remember that if a polynomial \\( P(z) \\) divides \\( z^k - 1 \\), then all the roots of \\( P(z) \\) must be \\( k \\)-th roots of unity. That is, every root \\( \\alpha \\) of \\( P(z) \\) satisfies \\( \\alpha^k = 1 \\). So, the order of each root \\( \\alpha \\) (the smallest positive integer \\( d \\) such that \\( \\alpha^d = 1 \\)) must divide \\( k \\). Therefore, \\( k \\) must be the least common multiple (LCM) of the orders of all the roots of \\( P(z) \\).\n\nBut wait, how do I find the orders of the roots of \\( P(z) \\)? Maybe I can factor \\( P(z) \\) into cyclotomic polynomials because cyclotomic polynomials have roots that are primitive roots of unity, and their orders are known. Let me try that approach.\n\nCyclotomic polynomials are factors of \\( z^n - 1 \\) and are irreducible over the integers. Each cyclotomic polynomial \\( \\Phi_n(z) \\) corresponds to the primitive \\( n \\)-th roots of unity. So, if I can factor \\( P(z) \\) as a product of cyclotomic polynomials, the least common multiple of their indices will give me the minimal \\( k \\).\n\nLet me write down \\( P(z) \\) again: \\( P(z) = z^{10} + z^9 + z^6 + z^5 + z^4 + z + 1 \\). Hmm, maybe I can factor this polynomial. Let me see if it's a cyclotomic polynomial or a product of them.\n\nI know that cyclotomic polynomials have degrees equal to Euler's totient function \\( \\phi(n) \\). So, \\( \\Phi_n(z) \\) has degree \\( \\phi(n) \\). Let me see the degrees of \\( P(z) \\). It's a degree 10 polynomial, so perhaps it's a product of cyclotomic polynomials whose degrees add up to 10.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \\( P(z) \\) is a cyclotomic polynomial itself. Let me check if \\( P(z) \\) is equal to \\( \\Phi_n(z) \\) for some \\( n \\). To do that, I can recall that \\( \\Phi_n(z) \\) is the minimal polynomial over the integers for primitive \\( n \\)-th roots of unity.\n\nLet me try to compute \\( \\Phi_{21}(z) \\) because 21 is a number that comes to mind when I see exponents adding up to 10, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe \\( n = 11 \\) or another number. Wait, let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write \\( P(z) \\) as a combination of geometric series or factor it using known identities. Let me see:\n\nLooking at \\( P(z) = z^{10} + z^9 + z^6 + z^5 + z^4 + z + 1 \\).\n\nI notice that the exponents go from 0 to 10, but some exponents are missing. Let me list the exponents present: 0 (constant term is 1, so z^0), 1, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10. So, exponents 2, 3, 7, 8, and 10 are present except for 10? Wait, no, 10 is present. Wait, 0 is present as the constant term. So, exponents missing are 2, 3, 7, 8.\n\nWait, maybe I can group terms or factor \\( P(z) \\) in a clever way. Let me try to group terms:\n\n\\( P(z) = (z^{10} + z^9) + (z^6 + z^5) + (z^4 + z) + 1 \\).\n\nHmm, maybe factor each pair:\n\n\\( z^9(z + 1) + z^5(z + 1) + z(z^3 + 1) + 1 \\).\n\nWait, that doesn't seem helpful. Alternatively, maybe factor out \\( z \\) from some terms:\n\n\\( z^{10} + z^9 = z^9(z + 1) \\),\n\\( z^6 + z^5 = z^5(z + 1) \\),\n\\( z^4 + z = z(z^3 + 1) \\),\nand then the constant term is 1.\n\nSo, putting it together:\n\n\\( P(z) = z^9(z + 1) + z^5(z + 1) + z(z^3 + 1) + 1 \\).\n\nHmm, I can factor \\( (z + 1) \\) from the first two terms:\n\n\\( (z + 1)(z^9 + z^5) + z(z^3 + 1) + 1 \\).\n\nNot sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe I can write \\( P(z) \\) as a geometric series. Let me see:\n\nA geometric series is \\( 1 + z + z^2 + \\dots + z^n \\). But \\( P(z) \\) isn't a complete geometric series. Let me see if I can express \\( P(z) \\) as a combination of geometric series.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write \\( P(z) \\) as \\( \\frac{z^{11} - 1}{z - 1} \\) minus some terms. Let's see:\n\n\\( \\frac{z^{11} - 1}{z - 1} = z^{10} + z^9 + z^8 + z^7 + z^6 + z^5 + z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 \\).\n\nComparing this to \\( P(z) = z^{10} + z^9 + z^6 + z^5 + z^4 + z + 1 \\), I see that \\( P(z) \\) is missing the terms \\( z^8, z^7, z^3, z^2 \\). So, \\( P(z) = \\frac{z^{11} - 1}{z - 1} - (z^8 + z^7 + z^3 + z^2) \\).\n\nHmm, maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I can factor \\( P(z) \\) as a product of lower-degree polynomials. Let me try to factor \\( P(z) \\).\n\nLet me check if \\( z = 1 \\) is a root of \\( P(z) \\). Plugging \\( z = 1 \\), we get \\( 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 7 \\), which is not zero. So, \\( z - 1 \\) is not a factor.\n\nHow about \\( z = -1 \\)? Plugging \\( z = -1 \\), we get \\( (-1)^{10} + (-1)^9 + (-1)^6 + (-1)^5 + (-1)^4 + (-1) + 1 = 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + 1 = 1 \\), which is also not zero. So, \\( z + 1 \\) isn't a factor either.\n\nMaybe I can try to factor \\( P(z) \\) as a product of quadratics or cubics. Let me try to see if it's divisible by \\( z^2 + z + 1 \\), which is \\( \\Phi_3(z) \\). Let me perform polynomial division.\n\nDividing \\( P(z) \\) by \\( z^2 + z + 1 \\):\n\nLet me set it up:\n\nDividend: \\( z^{10} + z^9 + z^6 + z^5 + z^4 + z + 1 \\)\nDivisor: \\( z^2 + z + 1 \\)\n\nI can use polynomial long division. Alternatively, since \\( z^3 \\equiv 1 \\) modulo \\( z^2 + z + 1 \\), because \\( z^3 - 1 = (z - 1)(z^2 + z + 1) \\), so \\( z^3 \\equiv 1 \\) mod \\( z^2 + z + 1 \\).\n\nTherefore, I can reduce each exponent modulo 3:\n\nLet me list the exponents in \\( P(z) \\): 10, 9, 6, 5, 4, 1, 0.\n\nCompute each exponent mod 3:\n\n10 mod 3 = 1,\n9 mod 3 = 0,\n6 mod 3 = 0,\n5 mod 3 = 2,\n4 mod 3 = 1,\n1 mod 3 = 1,\n0 mod 3 = 0.\n\nSo, \\( P(z) \\) modulo \\( z^2 + z + 1 \\) becomes:\n\n\\( z^{1} + z^{0} + z^{0} + z^{2} + z^{1} + z^{1} + z^{0} \\).\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\( z + 1 + 1 + z^2 + z + z + 1 \\).\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n- \\( z^2 \\) term: 1 term\n- \\( z \\) terms: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3z\n- constants: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3\n\nSo, modulo \\( z^2 + z + 1 \\), \\( P(z) \\equiv z^2 + 3z + 3 \\).\n\nNow, if \\( z^2 + z + 1 \\) divides \\( P(z) \\), then \\( P(z) \\equiv 0 \\) mod \\( z^2 + z + 1 \\), which would mean \\( z^2 + 3z + 3 \\equiv 0 \\) mod \\( z^2 + z + 1 \\).\n\nBut \\( z^2 \\equiv -z - 1 \\) mod \\( z^2 + z + 1 \\).\n\nSo, substitute \\( z^2 \\) with \\( -z -1 \\) in \\( z^2 + 3z + 3 \\):\n\n\\( (-z - 1) + 3z + 3 = (-z + 3z) + (-1 + 3) = 2z + 2 \\).\n\nSo, \\( P(z) \\equiv 2z + 2 \\) mod \\( z^2 + z + 1 \\).\n\nFor \\( z^2 + z + 1 \\) to divide \\( P(z) \\), this must be congruent to 0, so \\( 2z + 2 = 0 \\) mod \\( z^2 + z + 1 \\). But \\( 2z + 2 \\) is a linear polynomial, and \\( z^2 + z + 1 \\) is quadratic, so unless \\( 2z + 2 \\) is the zero polynomial mod \\( z^2 + z + 1 \\), which it isn't, \\( z^2 + z + 1 \\) doesn't divide \\( P(z) \\).\n\nSo, \\( \\Phi_3(z) \\) isn't a factor. Maybe try another cyclotomic polynomial. Let me try \\( \\Phi_7(z) \\), which is \\( z^6 + z^5 + z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 \\). Hmm, that's a degree 6 polynomial. Let me see if \\( \\Phi_7(z) \\) divides \\( P(z) \\).\n\nLet me perform polynomial division of \\( P(z) \\) by \\( \\Phi_7(z) \\).\n\nAlternatively, since \\( \\Phi_7(z) \\) divides \\( z^7 - 1 \\), perhaps I can use the fact that if \\( \\Phi_7(z) \\) divides \\( P(z) \\), then all 7th roots of unity are roots of \\( P(z) \\). Let me check \\( P(z) \\) at \\( z = \\omega \\), where \\( \\omega^7 = 1 \\) and \\( \\omega \\neq 1 \\).\n\nSo, \\( P(\\omega) = \\omega^{10} + \\omega^9 + \\omega^6 + \\omega^5 + \\omega^4 + \\omega + 1 \\).\n\nSince \\( \\omega^7 = 1 \\), we can reduce exponents modulo 7:\n\n10 mod 7 = 3,\n9 mod 7 = 2,\n6 mod 7 = 6,\n5 mod 7 = 5,\n4 mod 7 = 4,\n1 mod 7 = 1,\n0 mod 7 = 0 (but the constant term is 1, which is \\( \\omega^0 \\)).\n\nSo, \\( P(\\omega) = \\omega^3 + \\omega^2 + \\omega^6 + \\omega^5 + \\omega^4 + \\omega + 1 \\).\n\nBut \\( \\Phi_7(\\omega) = \\omega^6 + \\omega^5 + \\omega^4 + \\omega^3 + \\omega^2 + \\omega + 1 = 0 \\).\n\nComparing this to \\( P(\\omega) \\), we see that \\( P(\\omega) = \\Phi_7(\\omega) = 0 \\). Therefore, \\( \\Phi_7(z) \\) divides \\( P(z) \\).\n\nGreat! So, \\( \\Phi_7(z) \\) is a factor of \\( P(z) \\). Now, let's see if \\( P(z) \\) can be factored further. Since \\( P(z) \\) is degree 10 and \\( \\Phi_7(z) \\) is degree 6, the remaining factor must be a degree 4 polynomial. Let me perform the division to find the other factor.\n\nLet me divide \\( P(z) \\) by \\( \\Phi_7(z) \\):\n\n\\( P(z) = (z^{10} + z^9 + z^6 + z^5 + z^4 + z + 1) \\)\nDivide by \\( \\Phi_7(z) = z^6 + z^5 + z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 \\).\n\nUsing polynomial long division:\n\nFirst term: \\( z^{10} \\) divided by \\( z^6 \\) is \\( z^4 \\). Multiply \\( \\Phi_7(z) \\) by \\( z^4 \\):\n\n\\( z^{10} + z^9 + z^8 + z^7 + z^6 + z^5 + z^4 \\).\n\nSubtract this from \\( P(z) \\):\n\n\\( (z^{10} + z^9 + z^6 + z^5 + z^4 + z + 1) - (z^{10} + z^9 + z^8 + z^7 + z^6 + z^5 + z^4) \\)\n= \\( 0 + 0 - z^8 - z^7 + 0 + 0 + 0 + z + 1 \\).\n\nSo, the remainder after first step is \\( -z^8 - z^7 + z + 1 \\).\n\nNext term: \\( -z^8 \\) divided by \\( z^6 \\) is \\( -z^2 \\). Multiply \\( \\Phi_7(z) \\) by \\( -z^2 \\):\n\n\\( -z^8 - z^7 - z^6 - z^5 - z^4 - z^3 - z^2 \\).\n\nSubtract this from the current remainder:\n\n\\( (-z^8 - z^7 + z + 1) - (-z^8 - z^7 - z^6 - z^5 - z^4 - z^3 - z^2) \\)\n= \\( 0 + 0 + z^6 + z^5 + z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 \\).\n\nSo, the new remainder is \\( z^6 + z^5 + z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 \\).\n\nWait, that's exactly \\( \\Phi_7(z) \\). So, the next term is \\( +1 \\) because \\( z^6 \\) divided by \\( z^6 \\) is 1. Multiply \\( \\Phi_7(z) \\) by 1:\n\n\\( z^6 + z^5 + z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 \\).\n\nSubtract this from the current remainder:\n\n\\( (z^6 + z^5 + z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) - (z^6 + z^5 + z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) = 0 \\).\n\nSo, the division works perfectly, and the quotient is \\( z^4 - z^2 + 1 \\). Therefore, \\( P(z) = \\Phi_7(z) \\times (z^4 - z^2 + 1) \\).\n\nNow, I need to check if \\( z^4 - z^2 + 1 \\) is a cyclotomic polynomial or can be factored further. Let me see.\n\nFirst, let me check if \\( z^4 - z^2 + 1 \\) is irreducible over the integers. If it factors, it would factor into quadratics or a product of quadratics and linears, but since it's degree 4 and we don't have linear factors (as we saw earlier that \\( z = 1 \\) and \\( z = -1 \\) aren't roots), it might factor into two quadratics.\n\nLet me try to factor \\( z^4 - z^2 + 1 \\). Suppose it factors as \\( (z^2 + az + b)(z^2 + cz + d) \\).\n\nMultiplying out:\n\n\\( z^4 + (a + c)z^3 + (ac + b + d)z^2 + (ad + bc)z + bd \\).\n\nComparing coefficients with \\( z^4 - z^2 + 1 \\):\n\n1. Leading coefficient: 1, which matches.\n2. \\( a + c = 0 \\) (since coefficient of \\( z^3 \\) is 0).\n3. \\( ac + b + d = -1 \\) (coefficient of \\( z^2 \\)).\n4. \\( ad + bc = 0 \\) (coefficient of \\( z \\) is 0).\n5. \\( bd = 1 \\) (constant term).\n\nFrom equation 2: \\( c = -a \\).\n\nFrom equation 5: \\( b \\) and \\( d \\) are integers such that \\( bd = 1 \\). So, possible pairs are (1,1) or (-1,-1).\n\nLet me try \\( b = 1 \\) and \\( d = 1 \\):\n\nThen equation 3: \\( a*(-a) + 1 + 1 = -a^2 + 2 = -1 \\) => \\( -a^2 + 2 = -1 \\) => \\( -a^2 = -3 \\) => \\( a^2 = 3 \\). But \\( a \\) must be integer, so no solution here.\n\nNext, try \\( b = -1 \\) and \\( d = -1 \\):\n\nEquation 3: \\( a*(-a) + (-1) + (-1) = -a^2 - 2 = -1 \\) => \\( -a^2 = 1 \\) => \\( a^2 = -1 \\), which is impossible for real \\( a \\).\n\nSo, no such integers \\( a, b, c, d \\) exist, meaning \\( z^4 - z^2 + 1 \\) is irreducible over integers. Therefore, it's a cyclotomic polynomial or a product of cyclotomic polynomials.\n\nWait, let me check if \\( z^4 - z^2 + 1 \\) is a cyclotomic polynomial. Let me recall that cyclotomic polynomials are factors of \\( z^n - 1 \\) and are irreducible over the integers.\n\nLet me compute \\( \\Phi_{12}(z) \\). \\( \\Phi_{12}(z) \\) is the 12th cyclotomic polynomial. The formula for \\( \\Phi_n(z) \\) when \\( n \\) is a power of a prime or product of distinct primes. For \\( n = 12 = 2^2 * 3 \\), the cyclotomic polynomial is \\( \\Phi_{12}(z) = z^4 - z^2 + 1 \\). Yes, that's correct!\n\nSo, \\( z^4 - z^2 + 1 = \\Phi_{12}(z) \\). Therefore, \\( P(z) = \\Phi_7(z) \\times \\Phi_{12}(z) \\).\n\nTherefore, \\( P(z) \\) divides \\( z^k - 1 \\) if and only if both \\( \\Phi_7(z) \\) and \\( \\Phi_{12}(z) \\) divide \\( z^k - 1 \\). Since cyclotomic polynomials are irreducible, their LCM in terms of exponents is the LCM of their orders.\n\nThe order of \\( \\Phi_7(z) \\) is 7, and the order of \\( \\Phi_{12}(z) \\) is 12. Therefore, the minimal \\( k \\) such that both 7 and 12 divide \\( k \\) is the least common multiple of 7 and 12, which is 84.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me double-check. The minimal \\( k \\) such that both 7 and 12 divide \\( k \\) is indeed LCM(7,12). Since 7 and 12 are coprime, LCM(7,12) = 7*12 = 84.\n\nTherefore, the minimal \\( k \\) is 84. Let me verify this. Since \\( P(z) = \\Phi_7(z) \\Phi_{12}(z) \\), then \\( z^{84} - 1 \\) will be divisible by both \\( \\Phi_7(z) \\) and \\( \\Phi_{12}(z) \\), hence by their product \\( P(z) \\).\n\nIs there a smaller \\( k \\)? Let me think. Since 7 and 12 are coprime, their LCM is indeed 84, so there's no smaller \\( k \\) that is a multiple of both 7 and 12. So, 84 is the minimal such \\( k \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is \\( \\boxed{84} \\).\n</think>\n\nTo find the smallest positive integer \\( k \\) such that the polynomial \\( P(z) = z^{10} + z^9 + z^6 + z^5 + z^4 + z + 1 \\) divides \\( z^k - 1 \\), we factor \\( P(z) \\) into cyclotomic polynomials.\n\n1. **Factor \\( P(z) \\)**:\n   - Recognize that \\( P(z) \\) can be factored as \\( \\Phi_7(z) \\times \\Phi_{12}(z) \\), where \\( \\Phi_7(z) \\) and \\( \\Phi_{12}(z) \\) are cyclotomic polynomials corresponding to primitive 7th and 12th roots of unity, respectively.\n\n2. **Determine the orders**:\n   - The order of \\( \\Phi_7(z) \\) is 7.\n   - The order of \\( \\Phi_{12}(z) \\) is 12.\n\n3. **Compute the least common multiple (LCM)**:\n   - The minimal \\( k \\) is the LCM of 7 and 12, which is \\( \\text{LCM}(7, 12) = 84 \\).\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer \\( k \\) is \\( \\boxed{84} \\).",
