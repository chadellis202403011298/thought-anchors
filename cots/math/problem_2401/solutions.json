If I reach in and randomly remove three pieces of silverware, what is the probability that I get one fork, one spoon, and one knife? Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this problem here about probability, and I need to figure out the chance of picking one fork, one spoon, and one knife when I randomly remove three pieces of silverware from a drawer. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the setup. The drawer has 6 forks, 6 spoons, and 6 knives. So that's a total of 6 + 6 + 6, which is 18 pieces of silverware. I'm going to reach in and take out three pieces without looking, and I want to find the probability that I end up with one of each type: one fork, one spoon, and one knife.\n\nHmm, probability problems can sometimes be tricky, but I remember that probability is generally the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So I think I need to calculate how many ways there are to pick one fork, one spoon, and one knife, and then divide that by the total number of ways to pick any three pieces of silverware from the drawer.\n\nLet me write this down to keep track:\n\nProbability = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)\n\nSo, the total number of possible outcomes is the number of ways to choose any three pieces from 18. That sounds like a combination problem because the order in which I pick the silverware doesn't matter. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number we're choosing.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to pick three pieces is C(18, 3). Let me calculate that:\n\nC(18, 3) = 18! / (3! * (18 - 3)!) = (18 * 17 * 16) / (3 * 2 * 1) = (18 * 17 * 16) / 6.\n\nLet me compute that: 18 divided by 6 is 3, so 3 * 17 * 16. 3 * 17 is 51, and 51 * 16. Let me do 50 * 16 = 800, and 1 * 16 = 16, so 800 + 16 = 816. So, the total number of possible outcomes is 816.\n\nNow, the number of favorable outcomes is the number of ways to pick one fork, one spoon, and one knife. Since there are 6 forks, 6 spoons, and 6 knives, the number of ways to choose one of each would be the product of the number of choices for each type. So that's 6 choices for a fork, 6 for a spoon, and 6 for a knife. So, 6 * 6 * 6.\n\nWait, but hold on, is that correct? Because when I'm picking one of each, the order doesn't matter, right? Because whether I pick a fork first or a spoon first, it's still one of each. So maybe I don't need to worry about permutations here. Let me think.\n\nActually, when I compute the number of favorable outcomes, it's the number of ways to choose one fork, one spoon, and one knife. Since each selection is independent, I can multiply the number of choices for each. So yes, it's 6 * 6 * 6, which is 216.\n\nWait, but hold on again. Let me make sure. So, for each fork, there are 6 spoons and 6 knives, so for each fork, there are 6 * 6 possible combinations. Since there are 6 forks, it's 6 * (6 * 6) = 6 * 36 = 216. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nSo, the number of favorable outcomes is 216, and the total number of possible outcomes is 816. Therefore, the probability is 216 / 816.\n\nNow, let me simplify that fraction. Both numerator and denominator are divisible by 24, I think. Let me check: 216 \u00f7 24 = 9, because 24 * 9 = 216. And 816 \u00f7 24 is 34, because 24 * 34 is 816. So, that simplifies to 9/34.\n\nWait, let me double-check that division. 24 times 34: 24 * 30 = 720, and 24 * 4 = 96, so 720 + 96 = 816. Correct. And 24 * 9 = 216. So yes, the fraction simplifies to 9/34.\n\nAlternatively, I could have simplified the fraction step by step. Let's see: 216 and 816 are both even, so divide numerator and denominator by 2: 108 / 408. Still even, divide by 2 again: 54 / 204. Again, divide by 2: 27 / 102. Now, 27 and 102 are both divisible by 3: 27 \u00f7 3 = 9, 102 \u00f7 3 = 34. So, again, we get 9/34. That confirms the earlier simplification.\n\nSo, the probability is 9/34. To make sure I didn't make any mistakes, let me go through the steps again.\n\nTotal number of ways to pick 3 pieces: C(18,3) = 816. That seems correct because 18 choose 3 is a standard combination, and the calculation gave me 816.\n\nNumber of favorable outcomes: 6 forks, 6 spoons, 6 knives. So, 6 * 6 * 6 = 216. That seems right because for each type, you have 6 choices, and you're choosing one from each.\n\nSo, 216 / 816 = 9/34 after simplifying. That makes sense.\n\nWait, another way to think about this problem is using probabilities step by step. Let me try that approach to see if I get the same answer.\n\nThe probability of picking one fork, one spoon, and one knife can be calculated by considering the different orders in which I could pick these items. Since the order doesn't matter in combinations, but in probability, sometimes it's easier to compute step by step.\n\nSo, the first pick could be any type, then the second pick has to be a different type, and the third pick has to be the remaining type.\n\nSo, let's compute the probability for one specific order: fork first, then spoon, then knife.\n\nThe probability of picking a fork first is 6/18, which simplifies to 1/3.\n\nAfter picking a fork, there are now 17 pieces left, with 6 spoons and 6 knives remaining. So, the probability of picking a spoon next is 6/17.\n\nThen, after picking a spoon, there are 16 pieces left, with 6 knives remaining. So, the probability of picking a knife is 6/16, which simplifies to 3/8.\n\nSo, the probability for this specific order (fork, spoon, knife) is (6/18) * (6/17) * (6/16) = (1/3) * (6/17) * (3/8).\n\nLet me compute that: 1/3 * 6/17 = (6/51) = 2/17. Then, 2/17 * 3/8 = (6/136) = 3/68.\n\nBut wait, that's just for one specific order. However, the three items could be picked in any order: fork, spoon, knife; fork, knife, spoon; spoon, fork, knife; spoon, knife, fork; knife, fork, spoon; knife, spoon, fork. So, there are 3! = 6 possible orders.\n\nTherefore, the total probability is 6 * (3/68) = 18/68. Simplifying that, divide numerator and denominator by 2: 9/34.\n\nWait, that's the same answer as before! So that confirms that the probability is indeed 9/34.\n\nI think that makes sense. Both methods give the same result, so I must have done it right. So, the probability of picking one fork, one spoon, and one knife when removing three pieces of silverware is 9/34.\n</think>\n\nThe probability of randomly removing one fork, one spoon, and one knife from the drawer is calculated by determining the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. \n\nTotal possible outcomes: C(18,3) = 816.\n\nFavorable outcomes: 6 forks \u00d7 6 spoons \u00d7 6 knives = 216.\n\nProbability = 216 / 816 = 9/34.\n\n$\\boxed{\\dfrac{9}{34}}$",
