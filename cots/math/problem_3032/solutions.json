Let $A$ and $B$ be points on one of the semicircular arcs determined by $\\overline{MN}$ such that $A$ is the midpoint of the semicircle and $MB=\\frac{3}5$. Point $C$ lies on the other semicircular arc. Let $d$ be the length of the line segment whose endpoints are the intersections of diameter $\\overline{MN}$ with chords $\\overline{AC}$ and $\\overline{BC}$. The largest possible value of $d$ can be written in the form $r-s\\sqrt{t}$, where $r, s$ and $t$ are positive integers and $t$ is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find $r+s+t$.\n Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this geometry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to visualize it first. There's a circle with diameter MN, and the diameter is 1 unit long. That means the radius of the circle is 0.5 units. \n\nNow, the circle is divided into two semicircles by the diameter MN. Points A and B are on one of these semicircular arcs. A is the midpoint, so that should be the point directly opposite the center of the diameter. Since the diameter is 1, the center, let's call it O, is the midpoint of MN. So, point A is at the top of the circle, right? Because it's the midpoint of the semicircle.\n\nPoint B is another point on the same semicircle, and we're given that MB is 3/5. Hmm, okay. So, the distance from M to B along the circumference is 3/5. But wait, MB is given as a chord length, or is it the arc length? Hmm, the problem says MB = 3/5, but since it's on the circle, it's more likely the chord length unless specified otherwise. So, I'll assume it's the chord length.\n\nPoint C is on the other semicircular arc, so opposite to where A and B are. We need to find the length d, which is the distance between the intersections of diameter MN with chords AC and BC. So, if we draw chords AC and BC, they will intersect the diameter MN at two points, and the distance between these two points is d. We need to find the maximum possible value of d, which can be written in the form r - s\u221at, where r, s, t are positive integers, and t is square-free. Then, we need to find r + s + t.\n\nAlright, let me try to draw a diagram mentally. We have a circle with diameter MN of length 1, center O. Point A is at the top, the midpoint of the semicircle. Point B is somewhere on the same semicircle, such that the chord MB has length 3/5. Point C is on the opposite semicircle, and we can move it around to find the maximum d.\n\nFirst, let me set up a coordinate system to model this. Let's place the center O at (0, 0). Then, point M is at (-0.5, 0), and point N is at (0.5, 0). Point A, being the midpoint of the semicircle, is at (0, 0.5). \n\nNow, point B is on the same semicircle as A, so it's on the upper semicircle. The chord length from M to B is 3/5. Let's find the coordinates of point B.\n\nThe chord length between two points on a circle can be related to the central angle between them. The formula for chord length is 2r sin(\u03b8/2), where \u03b8 is the central angle in radians, and r is the radius. Since the radius is 0.5, the chord length MB is 2*(0.5)*sin(\u03b8/2) = sin(\u03b8/2). So, sin(\u03b8/2) = 3/5. Therefore, \u03b8/2 = arcsin(3/5), so \u03b8 = 2 arcsin(3/5).\n\nLet me compute arcsin(3/5). I know that sin(\u03b8) = 3/5, so \u03b8 is approximately 36.87 degrees. Therefore, \u03b8/2 is approximately 18.43 degrees, but I might need exact values later, so let's keep it symbolic.\n\nSo, the central angle between M and B is \u03b8 = 2 arcsin(3/5). Since M is at (-0.5, 0), and the center is at (0, 0), point B will be \u03b8 radians away from M along the circumference. But wait, actually, since we're dealing with chord length, we need to find the coordinates of point B.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to use coordinate geometry. Let me denote point B as (x, y). Since it's on the circle, x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = (0.5)\u00b2 = 0.25. The chord length from M(-0.5, 0) to B(x, y) is 3/5. So, the distance formula gives sqrt[(x + 0.5)\u00b2 + (y - 0)\u00b2] = 3/5.\n\nSquaring both sides: (x + 0.5)\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 9/25. But since x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 0.25, we can substitute y\u00b2 = 0.25 - x\u00b2 into the first equation.\n\nSo, (x + 0.5)\u00b2 + (0.25 - x\u00b2) = 9/25.\n\nLet me expand (x + 0.5)\u00b2: x\u00b2 + x + 0.25.\n\nSo, x\u00b2 + x + 0.25 + 0.25 - x\u00b2 = 9/25.\n\nSimplify: x + 0.5 = 9/25.\n\nTherefore, x = 9/25 - 0.5 = 9/25 - 12.5/25 = (9 - 12.5)/25 = (-3.5)/25 = -7/50.\n\nSo, x = -7/50. Then, y\u00b2 = 0.25 - x\u00b2 = 0.25 - (49/2500) = (625/2500 - 49/2500) = 576/2500. So, y = 24/50 = 12/25.\n\nTherefore, point B is at (-7/50, 12/25). Let me write that down: B(-7/50, 12/25).\n\nOkay, now point C is on the other semicircle, which is the lower semicircle since A and B are on the upper one. So, point C can be parameterized as (0.5 cos \u03c6, -0.5 sin \u03c6) for some angle \u03c6. Alternatively, since it's a unit circle scaled by 0.5, but let me see.\n\nWait, the circle has radius 0.5, so coordinates can be written as (0.5 cos \u03c6, 0.5 sin \u03c6). But since it's on the lower semicircle, sin \u03c6 will be negative, so point C can be (0.5 cos \u03c6, -0.5 sin \u03c6). Let me use \u03c6 as the parameter.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to let point C be at (x, y) where x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 0.25 and y \u2264 0.\n\nBut perhaps using angles is better. Let me think.\n\nSo, we need to find the intersections of chords AC and BC with diameter MN, which is the x-axis from (-0.5, 0) to (0.5, 0). So, we can find the equations of lines AC and BC, find where they intersect the x-axis, and then compute the distance between those two intersection points.\n\nOur goal is to maximize this distance d as point C moves around the lower semicircle.\n\nSo, let's parametrize point C as (0.5 cos \u03c6, -0.5 sin \u03c6), where \u03c6 is the angle from the positive x-axis to point C. Since it's on the lower semicircle, \u03c6 ranges from \u03c0 to 2\u03c0.\n\nNow, let's find the equations of lines AC and BC.\n\nFirst, point A is (0, 0.5), and point C is (0.5 cos \u03c6, -0.5 sin \u03c6). So, the line AC goes from (0, 0.5) to (0.5 cos \u03c6, -0.5 sin \u03c6). Let me find its equation.\n\nThe slope of AC is (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1) = (-0.5 sin \u03c6 - 0.5)/(0.5 cos \u03c6 - 0) = (-0.5 (sin \u03c6 + 1))/(0.5 cos \u03c6) = (- (sin \u03c6 + 1))/cos \u03c6.\n\nSo, the slope m_AC = - (sin \u03c6 + 1)/cos \u03c6.\n\nTherefore, the equation of line AC is y - 0.5 = m_AC (x - 0), so y = [ - (sin \u03c6 + 1)/cos \u03c6 ] x + 0.5.\n\nSimilarly, for line BC: points B(-7/50, 12/25) and C(0.5 cos \u03c6, -0.5 sin \u03c6). Let's compute the slope.\n\nSlope m_BC = [ -0.5 sin \u03c6 - 12/25 ] / [0.5 cos \u03c6 - (-7/50) ].\n\nSimplify numerator: -0.5 sin \u03c6 - 12/25 = (- (sin \u03c6)/2 - 12/25).\n\nDenominator: 0.5 cos \u03c6 + 7/50 = ( (25 cos \u03c6)/50 + 7/50 ) = (25 cos \u03c6 + 7)/50.\n\nSo, m_BC = [ - (sin \u03c6)/2 - 12/25 ] / [ (25 cos \u03c6 + 7)/50 ].\n\nLet me write both numerator and denominator with denominator 50:\n\nNumerator: [ -25 sin \u03c6 / 50 - 24/50 ] = [ -25 sin \u03c6 - 24 ] / 50.\n\nDenominator: (25 cos \u03c6 + 7)/50.\n\nSo, m_BC = [ (-25 sin \u03c6 - 24)/50 ] / [ (25 cos \u03c6 + 7)/50 ] = (-25 sin \u03c6 - 24)/(25 cos \u03c6 + 7).\n\nTherefore, m_BC = (-25 sin \u03c6 - 24)/(25 cos \u03c6 + 7).\n\nSo, the equation of line BC is y - 12/25 = m_BC (x + 7/50).\n\nWe need to find where lines AC and BC intersect the diameter MN, which is the x-axis (y = 0). So, let's find the intersection points.\n\nFirst, for line AC: set y = 0.\n\n0 = [ - (sin \u03c6 + 1)/cos \u03c6 ] x + 0.5.\n\nSo, [ - (sin \u03c6 + 1)/cos \u03c6 ] x = -0.5.\n\nMultiply both sides by cos \u03c6:\n\n- (sin \u03c6 + 1) x = -0.5 cos \u03c6.\n\nDivide both sides by - (sin \u03c6 + 1):\n\nx = (0.5 cos \u03c6)/(sin \u03c6 + 1).\n\nSo, the intersection point is ( (0.5 cos \u03c6)/(sin \u03c6 + 1), 0 ). Let's call this point P.\n\nSimilarly, for line BC: set y = 0.\n\n0 - 12/25 = m_BC (x + 7/50).\n\nSo, -12/25 = [ (-25 sin \u03c6 - 24)/(25 cos \u03c6 + 7) ] (x + 7/50).\n\nMultiply both sides by (25 cos \u03c6 + 7):\n\n-12/25 * (25 cos \u03c6 + 7) = (-25 sin \u03c6 - 24)(x + 7/50).\n\nSimplify left side:\n\n-12/25 * 25 cos \u03c6 = -12 cos \u03c6,\n\n-12/25 * 7 = -84/25.\n\nSo, left side: -12 cos \u03c6 - 84/25.\n\nRight side: (-25 sin \u03c6 - 24)(x + 7/50).\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n-12 cos \u03c6 - 84/25 = (-25 sin \u03c6 - 24)(x + 7/50).\n\nWe can solve for x:\n\nx + 7/50 = [ -12 cos \u03c6 - 84/25 ] / ( -25 sin \u03c6 - 24 ).\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n-12 cos \u03c6 - 84/25 = -12 cos \u03c6 - 3.36.\n\nBut let's keep it as fractions:\n\n-12 cos \u03c6 - 84/25 = (-300 cos \u03c6 - 84)/25.\n\nDenominator: -25 sin \u03c6 - 24 = - (25 sin \u03c6 + 24).\n\nSo, x + 7/50 = [ (-300 cos \u03c6 - 84)/25 ] / [ - (25 sin \u03c6 + 24) ].\n\nSimplify:\n\nx + 7/50 = [ (-300 cos \u03c6 - 84)/25 ] / [ - (25 sin \u03c6 + 24) ] = [ (300 cos \u03c6 + 84)/25 ] / (25 sin \u03c6 + 24 ).\n\nSo, x + 7/50 = (300 cos \u03c6 + 84)/(25*(25 sin \u03c6 + 24)).\n\nTherefore, x = (300 cos \u03c6 + 84)/(25*(25 sin \u03c6 + 24)) - 7/50.\n\nLet me compute this:\n\nFirst, write both terms with denominator 50:\n\n(300 cos \u03c6 + 84)/(25*(25 sin \u03c6 + 24)) = (300 cos \u03c6 + 84)*2/(50*(25 sin \u03c6 + 24)).\n\nSo, x = [2*(300 cos \u03c6 + 84)] / [50*(25 sin \u03c6 + 24)] - 7/50.\n\nCombine the terms:\n\nx = [2*(300 cos \u03c6 + 84) - 7*(25 sin \u03c6 + 24)] / [50*(25 sin \u03c6 + 24)].\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n2*(300 cos \u03c6 + 84) = 600 cos \u03c6 + 168,\n\n7*(25 sin \u03c6 + 24) = 175 sin \u03c6 + 168.\n\nSo, numerator = 600 cos \u03c6 + 168 - 175 sin \u03c6 - 168 = 600 cos \u03c6 - 175 sin \u03c6.\n\nTherefore, x = (600 cos \u03c6 - 175 sin \u03c6) / [50*(25 sin \u03c6 + 24)].\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nFactor numerator: 25*(24 cos \u03c6 - 7 sin \u03c6).\n\nWait, 600 cos \u03c6 is 24*25 cos \u03c6, and 175 sin \u03c6 is 7*25 sin \u03c6.\n\nSo, numerator = 25*(24 cos \u03c6 - 7 sin \u03c6).\n\nDenominator: 50*(25 sin \u03c6 + 24) = 50*(25 sin \u03c6 + 24).\n\nSo, x = [25*(24 cos \u03c6 - 7 sin \u03c6)] / [50*(25 sin \u03c6 + 24)] = [ (24 cos \u03c6 - 7 sin \u03c6) ] / [2*(25 sin \u03c6 + 24)].\n\nTherefore, x = (24 cos \u03c6 - 7 sin \u03c6)/(2*(25 sin \u03c6 + 24)).\n\nSo, the intersection point is ( (24 cos \u03c6 - 7 sin \u03c6)/(2*(25 sin \u03c6 + 24)), 0 ). Let's call this point Q.\n\nNow, we have points P and Q on the diameter MN where the chords AC and BC intersect MN. The distance d between P and Q is |x_P - x_Q|.\n\nFrom earlier, x_P = (0.5 cos \u03c6)/(sin \u03c6 + 1) = (cos \u03c6)/(2*(sin \u03c6 + 1)).\n\nx_Q = (24 cos \u03c6 - 7 sin \u03c6)/(2*(25 sin \u03c6 + 24)).\n\nSo, d = |x_P - x_Q|.\n\nLet me compute x_P - x_Q:\n\n= [cos \u03c6/(2*(sin \u03c6 + 1))] - [ (24 cos \u03c6 - 7 sin \u03c6)/(2*(25 sin \u03c6 + 24)) ]\n\nFactor out 1/2:\n\n= (1/2) [ cos \u03c6/(sin \u03c6 + 1) - (24 cos \u03c6 - 7 sin \u03c6)/(25 sin \u03c6 + 24) ]\n\nTo combine these fractions, find a common denominator, which is (sin \u03c6 + 1)(25 sin \u03c6 + 24).\n\nSo,\n\n= (1/2) [ cos \u03c6*(25 sin \u03c6 + 24) - (24 cos \u03c6 - 7 sin \u03c6)*(sin \u03c6 + 1) ] / [ (sin \u03c6 + 1)(25 sin \u03c6 + 24) ]\n\nLet me compute the numerator:\n\nFirst term: cos \u03c6*(25 sin \u03c6 + 24) = 25 sin \u03c6 cos \u03c6 + 24 cos \u03c6.\n\nSecond term: (24 cos \u03c6 - 7 sin \u03c6)*(sin \u03c6 + 1) = 24 cos \u03c6 sin \u03c6 + 24 cos \u03c6 - 7 sin \u03c6 sin \u03c6 - 7 sin \u03c6.\n\nSo, expanding:\n\n= 24 sin \u03c6 cos \u03c6 + 24 cos \u03c6 - 7 sin\u00b2 \u03c6 - 7 sin \u03c6.\n\nTherefore, the numerator is:\n\n[25 sin \u03c6 cos \u03c6 + 24 cos \u03c6] - [24 sin \u03c6 cos \u03c6 + 24 cos \u03c6 - 7 sin\u00b2 \u03c6 - 7 sin \u03c6]\n\n= 25 sin \u03c6 cos \u03c6 + 24 cos \u03c6 - 24 sin \u03c6 cos \u03c6 - 24 cos \u03c6 + 7 sin\u00b2 \u03c6 + 7 sin \u03c6\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\n25 sin \u03c6 cos \u03c6 - 24 sin \u03c6 cos \u03c6 = sin \u03c6 cos \u03c6.\n\n24 cos \u03c6 - 24 cos \u03c6 = 0.\n\nSo, remaining terms: sin \u03c6 cos \u03c6 + 7 sin\u00b2 \u03c6 + 7 sin \u03c6.\n\nFactor sin \u03c6:\n\n= sin \u03c6 (cos \u03c6 + 7 sin \u03c6 + 7).\n\nSo, numerator becomes sin \u03c6 (cos \u03c6 + 7 sin \u03c6 + 7).\n\nTherefore, d = (1/2) [ sin \u03c6 (cos \u03c6 + 7 sin \u03c6 + 7) ] / [ (sin \u03c6 + 1)(25 sin \u03c6 + 24) ]\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nNote that sin \u03c6 + 1 is a factor in the denominator. Let me see if it can be factored out from the numerator.\n\nLooking at cos \u03c6 + 7 sin \u03c6 + 7, can we factor sin \u03c6 + 1?\n\nLet me see: cos \u03c6 + 7 sin \u03c6 + 7 = cos \u03c6 + 7(sin \u03c6 + 1).\n\nYes! So, cos \u03c6 + 7 sin \u03c6 + 7 = cos \u03c6 + 7(sin \u03c6 + 1).\n\nTherefore, numerator: sin \u03c6 (cos \u03c6 + 7(sin \u03c6 + 1)) = sin \u03c6 (cos \u03c6 + 7 sin \u03c6 + 7).\n\nBut we already have that. So, writing it as:\n\n= sin \u03c6 [cos \u03c6 + 7(sin \u03c6 + 1)].\n\nSo, numerator is sin \u03c6 [cos \u03c6 + 7(sin \u03c6 + 1)].\n\nDenominator is (sin \u03c6 + 1)(25 sin \u03c6 + 24).\n\nSo, we can write:\n\nd = (1/2) [ sin \u03c6 (cos \u03c6 + 7(sin \u03c6 + 1)) ] / [ (sin \u03c6 + 1)(25 sin \u03c6 + 24) ]\n\nNotice that cos \u03c6 + 7(sin \u03c6 + 1) can be written as cos \u03c6 + 7 sin \u03c6 + 7.\n\nSo, let's see:\n\nd = (1/2) [ sin \u03c6 (cos \u03c6 + 7 sin \u03c6 + 7) ] / [ (sin \u03c6 + 1)(25 sin \u03c6 + 24) ]\n\nWe can factor 7 from the last two terms: cos \u03c6 + 7(sin \u03c6 + 1). Hmm, not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, let's try to manipulate the expression:\n\nLet me write cos \u03c6 + 7 sin \u03c6 + 7 as cos \u03c6 + 7 sin \u03c6 + 7 = cos \u03c6 + 7 sin \u03c6 + 7*1.\n\nHmm, perhaps we can write this as something involving (sin \u03c6 + 1). Let's see:\n\nLet me factor 7 from the last two terms:\n\n= cos \u03c6 + 7(sin \u03c6 + 1).\n\nYes, as I did earlier.\n\nSo, numerator is sin \u03c6 [cos \u03c6 + 7(sin \u03c6 + 1)] = sin \u03c6 [cos \u03c6 + 7 sin \u03c6 + 7].\n\nSo, putting it back:\n\nd = (1/2) [ sin \u03c6 (cos \u03c6 + 7 sin \u03c6 + 7) ] / [ (sin \u03c6 + 1)(25 sin \u03c6 + 24) ]\n\nNow, notice that cos \u03c6 + 7 sin \u03c6 + 7 can be written as cos \u03c6 + 7 sin \u03c6 + 7 = cos \u03c6 + 7(sin \u03c6 + 1).\n\nSo, we can write:\n\nd = (1/2) [ sin \u03c6 (cos \u03c6 + 7(sin \u03c6 + 1)) ] / [ (sin \u03c6 + 1)(25 sin \u03c6 + 24) ]\n\n= (1/2) [ sin \u03c6 (cos \u03c6 + 7 sin \u03c6 + 7) ] / [ (sin \u03c6 + 1)(25 sin \u03c6 + 24) ]\n\n= (1/2) [ sin \u03c6 (cos \u03c6 + 7 sin \u03c6 + 7) ] / [ (sin \u03c6 + 1)(25 sin \u03c6 + 24) ]\n\nLet me see if I can factor something out or simplify further. Maybe express cos \u03c6 in terms of sin \u03c6?\n\nWe know that cos \u03c6 = sqrt(1 - sin\u00b2 \u03c6), but that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, let's let t = sin \u03c6. Then, cos \u03c6 = sqrt(1 - t\u00b2), but since \u03c6 is between \u03c0 and 2\u03c0, cos \u03c6 can be positive or negative. Wait, \u03c6 is on the lower semicircle, so from \u03c0 to 2\u03c0. So, cos \u03c6 is positive between \u03c0/2 and 3\u03c0/2, but in our case, \u03c6 is from \u03c0 to 2\u03c0, so cos \u03c6 is positive from \u03c0 to 3\u03c0/2 and negative from 3\u03c0/2 to 2\u03c0. Hmm, that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can write everything in terms of t = sin \u03c6, but let's see.\n\nLet me denote t = sin \u03c6. Then, cos \u03c6 = sqrt(1 - t\u00b2), but we have to consider the sign. Since \u03c6 is between \u03c0 and 2\u03c0, sin \u03c6 is between -1 and 1, but cos \u03c6 is positive for \u03c6 between \u03c0/2 and 3\u03c0/2, and negative otherwise. However, since point C is on the lower semicircle, and we've parametrized it as (0.5 cos \u03c6, -0.5 sin \u03c6), cos \u03c6 can be positive or negative depending on \u03c6.\n\nWait, actually, \u03c6 is measured from the positive x-axis, so when \u03c6 is between \u03c0 and 2\u03c0, cos \u03c6 is negative between \u03c0 and 3\u03c0/2 and positive between 3\u03c0/2 and 2\u03c0. Hmm, this might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can write cos \u03c6 in terms of t and manage the square roots, but it might get messy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can rewrite the expression for d in terms of t = tan(\u03c6/2), using the Weierstrass substitution. But that might be overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that d is a function of \u03c6, and we can take its derivative with respect to \u03c6 and find its maximum.\n\nBut before that, let me see if I can simplify d further.\n\nSo, d = (1/2) [ sin \u03c6 (cos \u03c6 + 7 sin \u03c6 + 7) ] / [ (sin \u03c6 + 1)(25 sin \u03c6 + 24) ]\n\nLet me write it as:\n\nd = [ sin \u03c6 (cos \u03c6 + 7 sin \u03c6 + 7) ] / [ 2 (sin \u03c6 + 1)(25 sin \u03c6 + 24) ]\n\nLet me see if I can factor numerator and denominator.\n\nLooking at the numerator: sin \u03c6 (cos \u03c6 + 7 sin \u03c6 + 7).\n\nIs there a way to factor this?\n\nLet me write it as sin \u03c6 cos \u03c6 + 7 sin\u00b2 \u03c6 + 7 sin \u03c6.\n\nHmm, not obviously factorable.\n\nDenominator: (sin \u03c6 + 1)(25 sin \u03c6 + 24) = 25 sin\u00b2 \u03c6 + 24 sin \u03c6 + 25 sin \u03c6 + 24 = 25 sin\u00b2 \u03c6 + 49 sin \u03c6 + 24.\n\nSo, denominator is 25 sin\u00b2 \u03c6 + 49 sin \u03c6 + 24.\n\nNumerator: sin \u03c6 cos \u03c6 + 7 sin\u00b2 \u03c6 + 7 sin \u03c6.\n\nHmm, maybe express sin \u03c6 cos \u03c6 as (1/2) sin 2\u03c6, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express everything in terms of sin \u03c6 and cos \u03c6 and see if we can write d in a more manageable form.\n\nAlternatively, let me think about substituting t = sin \u03c6, then cos \u03c6 = sqrt(1 - t\u00b2), but as I said earlier, the sign might be an issue. However, since \u03c6 is between \u03c0 and 2\u03c0, t = sin \u03c6 is between -1 and 1, but cos \u03c6 is positive for \u03c6 in (3\u03c0/2, 2\u03c0) and negative otherwise.\n\nBut perhaps for simplicity, let's assume that cos \u03c6 is positive. Wait, no, that's not necessarily the case. Hmm, maybe it's better to express cos \u03c6 in terms of t and manage the absolute value.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that d is a function we can maximize using calculus.\n\nLet me denote t = sin \u03c6, so t \u2208 [-1, 1]. Then, cos \u03c6 = sqrt(1 - t\u00b2), but with the sign depending on \u03c6. However, since \u03c6 is between \u03c0 and 2\u03c0, cos \u03c6 is positive when \u03c6 is between 3\u03c0/2 and 2\u03c0, and negative when \u03c6 is between \u03c0 and 3\u03c0/2.\n\nBut since we're dealing with a maximum, perhaps the maximum occurs in a specific interval where cos \u03c6 has a consistent sign. Maybe we can consider both cases, but it might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can write cos \u03c6 as sqrt(1 - t\u00b2) and proceed, keeping in mind that for \u03c6 in [\u03c0, 3\u03c0/2], cos \u03c6 is negative, and for \u03c6 in [3\u03c0/2, 2\u03c0], cos \u03c6 is positive.\n\nBut maybe, for the sake of finding the maximum, we can proceed with t \u2208 [-1, 1] and cos \u03c6 = sqrt(1 - t\u00b2), but we have to be careful with the sign.\n\nWait, actually, in the expression for d, we have cos \u03c6 + 7 sin \u03c6 + 7. So, if cos \u03c6 is negative, that term becomes negative, which might affect the value of d.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to proceed with t = sin \u03c6, and express d in terms of t, handling the absolute value where necessary.\n\nSo, let's proceed.\n\nLet t = sin \u03c6, so t \u2208 [-1, 1].\n\nThen, cos \u03c6 = sqrt(1 - t\u00b2) with appropriate sign.\n\nBut let's see:\n\nIn the expression for d, we have cos \u03c6 + 7 sin \u03c6 + 7.\n\nSo, depending on the value of \u03c6, cos \u03c6 can be positive or negative.\n\nBut perhaps, to avoid dealing with the sign, we can consider that d is a function of t, and t can range from -1 to 1, and we can write d(t) as:\n\nd(t) = [ t * (sqrt(1 - t\u00b2) + 7 t + 7) ] / [ 2 (t + 1)(25 t + 24) ]\n\nBut with the caveat that sqrt(1 - t\u00b2) is positive when \u03c6 \u2208 (3\u03c0/2, 2\u03c0) and negative when \u03c6 \u2208 (\u03c0, 3\u03c0/2). Hmm, this complicates things because d(t) would have different expressions depending on the interval.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can square d(t) to make it easier, but since we're dealing with maximum, squaring might preserve the maximum.\n\nWait, but d(t) is an absolute value, so squaring would give the square of the maximum, but maybe it's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can parametrize \u03c6 differently, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use calculus and set derivative to zero.\n\nLet me try that approach.\n\nLet me denote t = sin \u03c6, so we can write d in terms of t.\n\nBut since d is a function of t, and t \u2208 [-1, 1], we can take the derivative of d with respect to t and set it to zero to find the maximum.\n\nBut before that, let me write d(t):\n\nd(t) = [ t (sqrt(1 - t\u00b2) + 7 t + 7) ] / [ 2 (t + 1)(25 t + 24) ]\n\nBut we have to be careful with the square root. Since sqrt(1 - t\u00b2) is positive, but depending on \u03c6, cos \u03c6 can be positive or negative. Wait, but in our earlier expression, cos \u03c6 was in the numerator as cos \u03c6 + 7 sin \u03c6 + 7, so depending on the sign of cos \u03c6, that term can be positive or negative.\n\nBut perhaps, since we're dealing with the length d, which is a distance, it's always positive. So, maybe we can consider |x_P - x_Q|, but in our earlier calculation, we already had x_P and x_Q as coordinates, so their difference could be positive or negative, but d is the absolute value.\n\nBut in the expression for d, we have:\n\nd = (1/2) [ sin \u03c6 (cos \u03c6 + 7 sin \u03c6 + 7) ] / [ (sin \u03c6 + 1)(25 sin \u03c6 + 24) ]\n\nSo, if we let t = sin \u03c6, then:\n\nd(t) = [ t (sqrt(1 - t\u00b2) + 7 t + 7) ] / [ 2 (t + 1)(25 t + 24) ]\n\nBut note that sqrt(1 - t\u00b2) is positive, but cos \u03c6 could be negative, so actually, in the numerator, we have cos \u03c6, which is sqrt(1 - t\u00b2) or -sqrt(1 - t\u00b2).\n\nWait, this complicates things because cos \u03c6 can be positive or negative. So, actually, the numerator is t*(cos \u03c6 + 7 t + 7), which is t*(\u00b1sqrt(1 - t\u00b2) + 7 t + 7).\n\nSo, depending on the value of \u03c6, we have two cases:\n\nCase 1: \u03c6 \u2208 [\u03c0, 3\u03c0/2], so cos \u03c6 \u2264 0. Then, cos \u03c6 = -sqrt(1 - t\u00b2).\n\nCase 2: \u03c6 \u2208 [3\u03c0/2, 2\u03c0], so cos \u03c6 \u2265 0. Then, cos \u03c6 = sqrt(1 - t\u00b2).\n\nTherefore, we can write d(t) as:\n\nFor \u03c6 \u2208 [\u03c0, 3\u03c0/2], t \u2208 [-1, 0]:\n\nd(t) = [ t*(-sqrt(1 - t\u00b2) + 7 t + 7) ] / [ 2 (t + 1)(25 t + 24) ]\n\nFor \u03c6 \u2208 [3\u03c0/2, 2\u03c0], t \u2208 [0, 1]:\n\nd(t) = [ t*(sqrt(1 - t\u00b2) + 7 t + 7) ] / [ 2 (t + 1)(25 t + 24) ]\n\nSo, we have two functions to consider, one for t \u2208 [-1, 0] and another for t \u2208 [0, 1]. We need to find the maximum of d(t) over t \u2208 [-1, 1].\n\nBut this seems complicated because of the piecewise nature. Maybe we can analyze both cases separately.\n\nFirst, let's consider t \u2208 [0, 1], since point C is on the lower semicircle, which is from \u03c0 to 2\u03c0, but t = sin \u03c6, so t \u2208 [-1, 1]. However, for \u03c6 \u2208 [3\u03c0/2, 2\u03c0], t = sin \u03c6 \u2208 [-1, 0], but wait, no: sin \u03c6 is -1 at 3\u03c0/2, and increases to 0 at 2\u03c0. So, actually, for \u03c6 \u2208 [3\u03c0/2, 2\u03c0], t = sin \u03c6 \u2208 [-1, 0].\n\nWait, I think I got that backwards. Let me clarify:\n\nWhen \u03c6 \u2208 [\u03c0, 3\u03c0/2], sin \u03c6 \u2208 [-1, 0].\n\nWhen \u03c6 \u2208 [3\u03c0/2, 2\u03c0], sin \u03c6 \u2208 [-1, 0] as well, but approaching 0 at 2\u03c0.\n\nWait, no, actually, sin \u03c6 at 3\u03c0/2 is -1, and from 3\u03c0/2 to 2\u03c0, sin \u03c6 goes from -1 back to 0. So, t = sin \u03c6 \u2208 [-1, 0] for \u03c6 \u2208 [\u03c0, 2\u03c0]. Wait, that can't be, because at \u03c6 = \u03c0, sin \u03c6 = 0, and at \u03c6 = 3\u03c0/2, sin \u03c6 = -1, and at \u03c6 = 2\u03c0, sin \u03c6 = 0 again. So, actually, t = sin \u03c6 \u2208 [-1, 0] for \u03c6 \u2208 [3\u03c0/2, 2\u03c0], and t \u2208 [0, 1] for \u03c6 \u2208 [\u03c0/2, 3\u03c0/2]. Wait, no, that's not correct.\n\nWait, let me get this straight:\n\n- For \u03c6 \u2208 [0, \u03c0/2], sin \u03c6 \u2208 [0, 1].\n\n- For \u03c6 \u2208 [\u03c0/2, \u03c0], sin \u03c6 \u2208 [1, 0].\n\n- For \u03c6 \u2208 [\u03c0, 3\u03c0/2], sin \u03c6 \u2208 [-1, 0].\n\n- For \u03c6 \u2208 [3\u03c0/2, 2\u03c0], sin \u03c6 \u2208 [0, 1].\n\nWait, no, that's not correct either.\n\nActually, sin \u03c6 is positive in [0, \u03c0] and negative in [\u03c0, 2\u03c0]. So, for \u03c6 \u2208 [0, \u03c0], sin \u03c6 \u2208 [0, 1] \u222a [ -1, 0]? Wait, no.\n\nWait, sin \u03c6 is positive in [0, \u03c0] and negative in [\u03c0, 2\u03c0]. So, t = sin \u03c6 is in [0, 1] for \u03c6 \u2208 [0, \u03c0], and in [-1, 0] for \u03c6 \u2208 [\u03c0, 2\u03c0].\n\nBut in our case, point C is on the lower semicircle, which corresponds to \u03c6 \u2208 [\u03c0, 2\u03c0], so t = sin \u03c6 \u2208 [-1, 0].\n\nWait, that seems conflicting with earlier.\n\nWait, no, actually, the lower semicircle is y \u2264 0, so points on the lower semicircle have y = -0.5 sin \u03c6, which is non-positive. So, sin \u03c6 can be positive or negative depending on \u03c6.\n\nBut \u03c6 is measured from the positive x-axis, so for point C on the lower semicircle, \u03c6 \u2208 [\u03c0, 2\u03c0], so sin \u03c6 \u2208 [-1, 0].\n\nTherefore, t = sin \u03c6 \u2208 [-1, 0].\n\nTherefore, in our earlier expression, cos \u03c6 is positive for \u03c6 \u2208 [3\u03c0/2, 2\u03c0], and negative for \u03c6 \u2208 [\u03c0, 3\u03c0/2].\n\nTherefore, in terms of t:\n\n- For t \u2208 [-1, 0], cos \u03c6 = sqrt(1 - t\u00b2) when \u03c6 \u2208 [3\u03c0/2, 2\u03c0], i.e., when t \u2208 [-1, 0] and \u03c6 \u2208 [3\u03c0/2, 2\u03c0], which corresponds to t \u2208 [-1, 0].\n\nWait, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, let's clarify:\n\n- \u03c6 \u2208 [\u03c0, 3\u03c0/2]: sin \u03c6 \u2208 [-1, 0], cos \u03c6 \u2264 0.\n\n- \u03c6 \u2208 [3\u03c0/2, 2\u03c0]: sin \u03c6 \u2208 [-1, 0], cos \u03c6 \u2265 0.\n\nTherefore, t = sin \u03c6 \u2208 [-1, 0], but cos \u03c6 can be positive or negative depending on \u03c6.\n\nSo, in terms of t, cos \u03c6 can be expressed as:\n\n- For \u03c6 \u2208 [\u03c0, 3\u03c0/2], cos \u03c6 = -sqrt(1 - t\u00b2).\n\n- For \u03c6 \u2208 [3\u03c0/2, 2\u03c0], cos \u03c6 = sqrt(1 - t\u00b2).\n\nTherefore, in terms of t \u2208 [-1, 0], we have two cases:\n\nCase 1: \u03c6 \u2208 [\u03c0, 3\u03c0/2], t \u2208 [-1, 0], cos \u03c6 = -sqrt(1 - t\u00b2).\n\nCase 2: \u03c6 \u2208 [3\u03c0/2, 2\u03c0], t \u2208 [-1, 0], cos \u03c6 = sqrt(1 - t\u00b2).\n\nTherefore, our function d(t) can be written as:\n\nFor t \u2208 [-1, 0]:\n\nd(t) = [ t*(cos \u03c6 + 7",
