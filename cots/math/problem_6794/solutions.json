Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the sum of the roots of the equation tan\u00b2x - 9 tanx + 1 = 0 that are between x = 0 and x = 2\u03c0 radians. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with equations involving tanx, it's often useful to use substitution to make it easier to solve. So, maybe I can let t = tanx. That way, the equation becomes a quadratic in terms of t, which I can solve using the quadratic formula or factoring if possible.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nLet t = tanx.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\nt\u00b2 - 9t + 1 = 0.\n\nNow, this is a quadratic equation, and I can solve for t using the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula states that for an equation of the form at\u00b2 + bt + c = 0, the solutions are t = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac)) / (2a). \n\nIn this case, a = 1, b = -9, and c = 1. Plugging these into the formula:\n\nt = (9 \u00b1 \u221a((-9)\u00b2 - 4*1*1)) / (2*1)\nt = (9 \u00b1 \u221a(81 - 4)) / 2\nt = (9 \u00b1 \u221a77) / 2\n\nSo, the solutions for t are (9 + \u221a77)/2 and (9 - \u221a77)/2. Let me calculate the approximate values of these to get a sense of the magnitude.\n\nFirst, \u221a77 is approximately 8.77496. So,\n\nt\u2081 = (9 + 8.77496)/2 \u2248 (17.77496)/2 \u2248 8.88748\n\nt\u2082 = (9 - 8.77496)/2 \u2248 (0.22504)/2 \u2248 0.11252\n\nSo, the two solutions for t are approximately 8.887 and 0.1125. \n\nNow, since t = tanx, we can find the values of x in the interval [0, 2\u03c0) where tanx equals these values. \n\nI know that the tangent function has a period of \u03c0, so for each solution t, there will be two solutions in the interval [0, 2\u03c0): one in the first quadrant and one in the third quadrant for t positive, and one in the second quadrant and one in the fourth quadrant for t negative. But since both t\u2081 and t\u2082 are positive, their solutions will be in the first and third quadrants.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Wait, tanx is positive in the first and third quadrants, and negative in the second and fourth. So, if t is positive, then x will be in the first or third quadrants, and if t is negative, x will be in the second or fourth. But in our case, both t\u2081 and t\u2082 are positive, so each will have two solutions in [0, 2\u03c0).\n\nSo, for each t, we'll have two solutions. Therefore, in total, we should have four solutions for x in [0, 2\u03c0). \n\nLet me find the principal values first. The principal value of x for tanx = t is arctan(t). So, for t\u2081 \u2248 8.887, arctan(8.887) is approximately how much? Let me think. I know that arctan(1) is \u03c0/4 \u2248 0.7854, arctan(0.1125) is small, around 0.112 radians, but for 8.887, it's close to arctan(9). Let me calculate arctan(8.887):\n\nUsing a calculator, arctan(8.887) is approximately 1.460 radians.\n\nSimilarly, arctan(0.1125) is approximately 0.1124 radians.\n\nSo, the principal solutions are x\u2081 \u2248 1.460 and x\u2082 \u2248 0.1124.\n\nBut since the tangent function has a period of \u03c0, the other solutions in [0, 2\u03c0) will be x\u2081 + \u03c0 and x\u2082 + \u03c0.\n\nSo, the four solutions are:\n\nx\u2081 \u2248 1.460\n\nx\u2082 \u2248 0.1124\n\nx\u2083 = x\u2081 + \u03c0 \u2248 1.460 + 3.1416 \u2248 4.6016\n\nx\u2084 = x\u2082 + \u03c0 \u2248 0.1124 + 3.1416 \u2248 3.2540\n\nSo, the four roots are approximately 0.1124, 1.460, 3.2540, and 4.6016 radians.\n\nNow, the problem asks for the sum of these roots. So, I can add them up:\n\nSum \u2248 0.1124 + 1.460 + 3.2540 + 4.6016\n\nLet me compute this step by step.\n\nFirst, 0.1124 + 1.460 = 1.5724\n\nThen, 3.2540 + 4.6016 = 7.8556\n\nNow, adding these two results: 1.5724 + 7.8556 \u2248 9.428 radians.\n\nHmm, 9.428 is approximately 3\u03c0, since \u03c0 \u2248 3.1416, so 3\u03c0 \u2248 9.4248, which is very close to our computed sum. So, the sum is approximately 3\u03c0, which is about 9.4248. The slight difference is due to the approximate values I used for the arctan solutions.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a more precise way to calculate this without approximating each root. Let me think.\n\nSince each solution is of the form arctan(t) + k\u03c0 for k = 0, 1, and t being each of the two roots, t\u2081 and t\u2082. So, for each t, we have two solutions: arctan(t\u2081) and arctan(t\u2081) + \u03c0, and similarly for t\u2082: arctan(t\u2082) and arctan(t\u2082) + \u03c0.\n\nTherefore, the four solutions are:\n\narctan(t\u2081), arctan(t\u2081) + \u03c0, arctan(t\u2082), arctan(t\u2082) + \u03c0.\n\nSo, when we sum them up:\n\nSum = arctan(t\u2081) + (arctan(t\u2081) + \u03c0) + arctan(t\u2082) + (arctan(t\u2082) + \u03c0)\n\nSimplifying:\n\nSum = 2 arctan(t\u2081) + 2 arctan(t\u2082) + 2\u03c0\n\nSo, Sum = 2(arctan(t\u2081) + arctan(t\u2082)) + 2\u03c0\n\nHmm, so if I can find arctan(t\u2081) + arctan(t\u2082), I can compute the sum.\n\nI remember there's a formula for arctan(a) + arctan(b). The formula is:\n\narctan(a) + arctan(b) = arctan((a + b)/(1 - ab)) + k\u03c0, depending on the values of a and b.\n\nBut first, let me compute t\u2081 * t\u2082.\n\nFrom the quadratic equation, t\u2081 * t\u2082 = c/a = 1/1 = 1.\n\nSo, t\u2081 * t\u2082 = 1.\n\nTherefore, arctan(t\u2081) + arctan(t\u2082) can be simplified using the formula.\n\nBut wait, since t\u2081 * t\u2082 = 1, then arctan(t\u2081) + arctan(t\u2082) = arctan(t\u2081) + arctan(1/t\u2081).\n\nI remember that arctan(t) + arctan(1/t) = \u03c0/2 when t > 0.\n\nYes, because tan(\u03c0/2 - \u03b8) = 1/tan\u03b8, so if t = tan\u03b8, then arctan(t) = \u03b8, and arctan(1/t) = \u03c0/2 - \u03b8, so their sum is \u03c0/2.\n\nTherefore, arctan(t\u2081) + arctan(t\u2082) = \u03c0/2.\n\nSo, going back to the sum:\n\nSum = 2*(\u03c0/2) + 2\u03c0 = \u03c0 + 2\u03c0 = 3\u03c0.\n\nTherefore, the sum of all the roots between 0 and 2\u03c0 is exactly 3\u03c0.\n\nWait, that's a much cleaner result than the approximate 9.428. So, the exact sum is 3\u03c0.\n\nLet me double-check this reasoning.\n\nWe have two solutions for t, t\u2081 and t\u2082, where t\u2081 * t\u2082 = 1. Therefore, arctan(t\u2081) + arctan(t\u2082) = \u03c0/2.\n\nEach solution for x is arctan(t) + k\u03c0, for k = 0,1.\n\nTherefore, for each t, we have two solutions: arctan(t) and arctan(t) + \u03c0.\n\nSo, for t\u2081, the solutions are arctan(t\u2081) and arctan(t\u2081) + \u03c0.\n\nFor t\u2082, the solutions are arctan(t\u2082) and arctan(t\u2082) + \u03c0.\n\nAdding all four solutions:\n\narctan(t\u2081) + (arctan(t\u2081) + \u03c0) + arctan(t\u2082) + (arctan(t\u2082) + \u03c0) = 2 arctan(t\u2081) + 2 arctan(t\u2082) + 2\u03c0.\n\nSince arctan(t\u2081) + arctan(t\u2082) = \u03c0/2, then 2*(\u03c0/2) = \u03c0.\n\nTherefore, total sum is \u03c0 + 2\u03c0 = 3\u03c0.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the exact sum is 3\u03c0.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. To confirm, let's consider that each pair of solutions for t adds up to \u03c0/2, and with two such pairs, each contributing \u03c0/2, the total sum becomes 3\u03c0.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that for each t, the two solutions add up to arctan(t) + (arctan(t) + \u03c0) = 2 arctan(t) + \u03c0.\n\nBut since we have two such t's, t\u2081 and t\u2082, the total sum would be 2(arctan(t\u2081) + arctan(t\u2082)) + 2\u03c0. As we established, arctan(t\u2081) + arctan(t\u2082) = \u03c0/2, so 2*(\u03c0/2) = \u03c0, and adding 2\u03c0 gives 3\u03c0.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the sum of all roots between 0 and 2\u03c0 is 3\u03c0.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe sum of the roots is \\boxed{3\\pi}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the sum of the roots of the equation \\(\\tan^2 x - 9 \\tan x + 1 = 0\\) that are between \\(x = 0\\) and \\(x = 2\\pi\\) radians, we start by letting \\(t = \\tan x\\). This transforms the equation into a quadratic equation:\n\n\\[t^2 - 9t + 1 = 0\\]\n\nUsing the quadratic formula, we solve for \\(t\\):\n\n\\[t = \\frac{9 \\pm \\sqrt{81 - 4}}{2} = \\frac{9 \\pm \\sqrt{77}}{2}\\]\n\nThe solutions are:\n\n\\[t_1 = \\frac{9 + \\sqrt{77}}{2} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad t_2 = \\frac{9 - \\sqrt{77}}{2}\\]\n\nSince \\(t_1\\) and \\(t_2\\) are positive, we find the corresponding values of \\(x\\) in the interval \\([0, 2\\pi)\\).
