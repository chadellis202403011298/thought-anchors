Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I need to solve this equation where the inverse function of f equals f evaluated at (2x)^-1. The function f is given as f(x) = 16x + 3. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that to find the inverse function f\u207b\u00b9(x), I need to switch the roles of x and y in the equation y = f(x) and then solve for y. So let me write that out.\n\nStarting with f(x) = 16x + 3, which is y = 16x + 3. To find the inverse, I swap x and y:\n\nx = 16y + 3.\n\nNow, I need to solve this equation for y. Let me subtract 3 from both sides:\n\nx - 3 = 16y.\n\nThen, divide both sides by 16:\n\ny = (x - 3)/16.\n\nSo, the inverse function f\u207b\u00b9(x) is (x - 3)/16. Got that part down.\n\nNext, the problem says f\u207b\u00b9(x) = f((2x)^-1). Let me make sure I understand what this means. The inverse function of f evaluated at x is equal to f evaluated at the reciprocal of 2x. So, I need to compute both sides and set them equal, then solve for x.\n\nLet me write that equation out:\n\nf\u207b\u00b9(x) = f((2x)^-1).\n\nSubstituting the expressions I have:\n\n(x - 3)/16 = f(1/(2x)).\n\nNow, I need to compute f(1/(2x)). Since f(x) = 16x + 3, plugging in 1/(2x) gives:\n\nf(1/(2x)) = 16*(1/(2x)) + 3.\n\nSimplify that:\n\n16*(1/(2x)) = 8/x, so f(1/(2x)) = 8/x + 3.\n\nSo now, the equation becomes:\n\n(x - 3)/16 = 8/x + 3.\n\nHmm, okay. Now I have an equation in terms of x. Let me write that down clearly:\n\n(x - 3)/16 = 8/x + 3.\n\nI need to solve this equation for x. Let me first get rid of the denominators to make it easier. The denominators I see are 16 and x. So, I can multiply both sides by 16x to eliminate them.\n\nMultiplying both sides by 16x:\n\n16x * [(x - 3)/16] = 16x * [8/x + 3].\n\nSimplify each term:\n\nOn the left side, 16x*(x - 3)/16 = x*(x - 3).\n\nOn the right side, 16x*(8/x) + 16x*3. Let's compute each part:\n\n16x*(8/x) = 16*(8) = 128, because x cancels out.\n\n16x*3 = 48x.\n\nSo, putting it together, the right side is 128 + 48x.\n\nSo now, the equation is:\n\nx(x - 3) = 128 + 48x.\n\nLet me expand the left side:\n\nx^2 - 3x = 128 + 48x.\n\nNow, bring all terms to one side to form a quadratic equation. Let's subtract 128 and 48x from both sides:\n\nx^2 - 3x - 128 - 48x = 0.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nx^2 - (3x + 48x) - 128 = 0\nx^2 - 51x - 128 = 0.\n\nSo, the quadratic equation is x^2 - 51x - 128 = 0.\n\nNow, I need to solve this quadratic equation. Let me see if it factors. The quadratic is x^2 - 51x - 128. Hmm, looking for two numbers that multiply to -128 and add up to -51. Hmm, let me think.\n\nFactors of 128 are 1 & 128, 2 & 64, 4 & 32, 8 & 16. Since the product is negative, one number is positive and the other is negative. Let's see:\n\nLooking for two numbers that add up to -51. Let's try 64 and -2: 64 - 2 = 62, which is not 51. How about 32 and -4: 32 -4 = 28, nope. 16 and -8: 16 -8 = 8, nope. Hmm, maybe it doesn't factor nicely. Let me check the discriminant to see if I can use the quadratic formula.\n\nThe quadratic formula is x = [51 \u00b1 sqrt(51^2 - 4*1*(-128))]/(2*1).\n\nCompute the discriminant:\n\nD = 51^2 - 4*1*(-128)\n= 2601 + 512\n= 3113.\n\nWait, 51^2 is 2601, and 4*128 is 512, so 2601 + 512 is 3113. Hmm, is 3113 a perfect square? Let me check.\n\nI know that 55^2 is 3025, and 56^2 is 3136. So, 3113 is between 3025 and 3136, so it's not a perfect square. Therefore, the solutions will be irrational. So, I'll have to use the quadratic formula with sqrt(3113).\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in calculation earlier. Let me check the discriminant again.\n\nWait, 51^2 is indeed 2601, and 4*1*(-128) is -512, so when computing D = 51^2 - 4*1*(-128) = 2601 + 512 = 3113. Yeah, that's correct.\n\nSo, the solutions are x = [51 \u00b1 sqrt(3113)] / 2.\n\nHmm, but the problem asks for the sum of all x that satisfy the equation. Wait, in a quadratic equation ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0, the sum of the roots is -b/a. So, in this case, the sum is 51/1 = 51.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in forming the quadratic equation. Let me go back through the steps.\n\nStarting from f\u207b\u00b9(x) = f(1/(2x)).\n\nf\u207b\u00b9(x) = (x - 3)/16.\n\nf(1/(2x)) = 16*(1/(2x)) + 3 = 8/x + 3.\n\nSo, equation is (x - 3)/16 = 8/x + 3.\n\nMultiply both sides by 16x: x(x - 3) = 128 + 48x.\n\nExpanding left side: x\u00b2 - 3x.\n\nSo, equation: x\u00b2 - 3x = 128 + 48x.\n\nBring all terms to left: x\u00b2 - 3x - 128 - 48x = 0.\n\nCombine like terms: x\u00b2 - 51x - 128 = 0.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the quadratic is correct, and the sum of roots is 51.\n\nWait, but I just want to make sure that both solutions are valid, because sometimes when dealing with inverses and reciprocals, there might be extraneous solutions.\n\nLet me check each solution in the original equation to ensure they don't make any denominators zero or anything like that.\n\nBut since the problem is asking for the sum of all x that satisfy the equation, and the quadratic equation has two roots, their sum is 51, regardless of whether they are both valid or not. Wait, but actually, in this case, I think both roots are valid because f is a linear function, and its inverse is also linear, so unless x is zero, which would make (2x)^-1 undefined, but in our equation, when we multiplied both sides by 16x, we assumed x \u2260 0, so x=0 is not a solution. Let me check if either of the roots is zero.\n\nBut from the quadratic equation, x\u00b2 -51x -128=0, plugging x=0 gives -128=0, which is false, so x=0 is not a solution. So, both solutions are valid as long as they don't make 2x zero, which they don't because x can't be zero, and from the quadratic, x isn't zero.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute the approximate values of the roots to see if they make sense.\n\nsqrt(3113) is approximately sqrt(3136)=56, so sqrt(3113)\u224855.79.\n\nSo, the roots are (51 \u00b1 55.79)/2.\n\nFirst root: (51 + 55.79)/2 \u2248 106.79/2 \u2248 53.395.\n\nSecond root: (51 - 55.79)/2 \u2248 (-4.79)/2 \u2248 -2.395.\n\nSo, x \u224853.395 and x\u2248-2.395.\n\nLet me check if these satisfy the original equation.\n\nFirst, x=53.395.\n\nCompute f\u207b\u00b9(53.395) = (53.395 - 3)/16 \u224850.395/16\u22483.1496.\n\nCompute f(1/(2*53.395)) = f(1/106.79) \u2248f(0.00936).\n\nf(0.00936)=16*0.00936 +3\u22480.1498 +3\u22483.1498.\n\nSo, f\u207b\u00b9(53.395) \u22483.1496 and f(1/(2x))\u22483.1498. Close enough, considering rounding errors.\n\nNow, x=-2.395.\n\nCompute f\u207b\u00b9(-2.395)= (-2.395 -3)/16\u2248-5.395/16\u2248-0.3372.\n\nCompute f(1/(2*(-2.395)))=f(1/(-4.79))\u2248f(-0.2087).\n\nf(-0.2087)=16*(-0.2087)+3\u2248-3.339 +3\u2248-0.339.\n\nWhich is close to -0.3372, again, within rounding error. So both solutions are valid.\n\nTherefore, the sum of all x that satisfy the equation is 51.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure that I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. Let me go through the steps again.\n\n1. Find f\u207b\u00b9(x):\n   - Start with y=16x+3.\n   - Swap x and y: x=16y+3.\n   - Solve for y: y=(x-3)/16. Correct.\n\n2. Compute f(1/(2x)):\n   - f(x)=16x+3.\n   - So, f(1/(2x))=16*(1/(2x)) +3=8/x +3. Correct.\n\n3. Set f\u207b\u00b9(x)=f(1/(2x)):\n   - (x-3)/16=8/x +3. Correct.\n\n4. Multiply both sides by 16x:\n   - Left side: 16x*(x-3)/16 =x(x-3).\n   - Right side:16x*(8/x +3)=128 +48x. Correct.\n\n5. Bring all terms to left: x\u00b2 -3x -128 -48x=0 \u2192x\u00b2 -51x -128=0. Correct.\n\n6. Sum of roots is 51. Correct.\n\nYes, everything checks out. So, the sum is 51.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe sum of all x that satisfy the equation is \\boxed{51}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the equation \\( f^{-1}(x) = f((2x)^{-1}) \\) where \\( f(x) = 16x + 3 \\), we start by finding the inverse function \\( f^{-1}(x) \\).\n\n1. **Find the inverse function \\( f^{-1}(x) \\):**\n   - Start with \\( y = 16x + 3 \\).\n   - Swap \\( x \\) and \\( y \\): \\( x = 16y + 3 \\).\n   - Solve for \\( y \\): \\( y = \\frac{x - 3}{16} \\).\n   - Thus, \\( f^{-1}(x) = \\frac{x - 3}{16} \\).\n\n2. **Compute \\( f((2x)^{-1}) \\):**\n   - Since \\( f(x) = 16x + 3 \\), substituting \\( \\frac{1}{2x} \\) gives:\n     \\[\n     f\\left(\\frac{1}{2x}\\right) = 16 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2x} + 3 = \\frac{8}{x} + 3\n     \\]\n\n3. **Set up the equation \\( f^{-1}(x) = f((2x)^{-1}) \\):**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{x - 3}{16} = \\frac{8}{x} + 3\n   \\]\n\n4. **Eliminate the denominators by multiplying both sides by \\( 16x \\):**\n   \\[\n   x(x - 3) = 128 + 48x\n   \\]\n\n5. **Simplify and form a quadratic equation:**\n   \\[\n   x^2 - 3x = 128 + 48x\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x^2 - 51x - 128 = 0\n   \\]\n\n6. **Find the sum of the roots using Vieta's formulas:**\n   - For the quadratic equation \\( x^2 - 51x - 128 = 0 \\), the sum of the roots is given by \\( -\\frac{b}{a} \\), where \\( a = 1 \\) and \\( b = -51 \\).\n   - Thus, the sum of the roots is \\( 51 \\).\n\nTherefore, the sum of all \\( x \\) that satisfy the equation is \\(\\boxed{51}\\).",
