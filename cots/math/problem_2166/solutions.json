A second urn contains $16$ green balls and $N$ blue balls. A single ball is drawn at random from each urn. The probability that both balls are of the same color is $0.58$. Find $N$.\n Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this probability problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.\n\nThere are two urns. The first urn has 4 green balls and 6 blue balls. The second urn has 16 green balls and N blue balls. We're told that when we draw one ball from each urn, the probability that both balls are the same color is 0.58. We need to find the value of N.\n\nAlright, so let's break this down. Probability problems can sometimes be tricky, but if I take it step by step, I should be able to handle it.\n\nFirst, let me note down the given information:\n\n- Urn 1: 4 green (G1), 6 blue (B1)\n- Urn 2: 16 green (G2), N blue (B2)\n- Probability that both balls are the same color (both green or both blue) is 0.58.\n\nI need to find N.\n\nI think the best approach is to calculate the probability of both balls being green and the probability of both balls being blue, then add them together because these are mutually exclusive events (they can't both happen at the same time). The sum should equal 0.58, so I can set up an equation and solve for N.\n\nLet me denote the probability of drawing a green ball from Urn 1 as P(G1) and the probability of drawing a blue ball from Urn 1 as P(B1). Similarly, for Urn 2, P(G2) and P(B2).\n\nSince the draws are independent, the probability of both events happening is the product of their individual probabilities.\n\nSo, P(both green) = P(G1) * P(G2)\nAnd P(both blue) = P(B1) * P(B2)\n\nThen, P(same color) = P(both green) + P(both blue) = 0.58\n\nLet me compute each probability.\n\nStarting with Urn 1: total number of balls is 4 green + 6 blue = 10 balls.\n\nSo, P(G1) = 4/10 = 0.4\nP(B1) = 6/10 = 0.6\n\nUrn 2 has 16 green and N blue balls, so the total number of balls is 16 + N.\n\nTherefore, P(G2) = 16 / (16 + N)\nAnd P(B2) = N / (16 + N)\n\nNow, let's write expressions for both same-color probabilities.\n\nP(both green) = P(G1) * P(G2) = (4/10) * (16 / (16 + N)) = (0.4) * (16 / (16 + N))\n\nSimilarly, P(both blue) = P(B1) * P(B2) = (6/10) * (N / (16 + N)) = (0.6) * (N / (16 + N))\n\nAdding these together:\n\n0.4*(16/(16 + N)) + 0.6*(N/(16 + N)) = 0.58\n\nHmm, that looks like an equation I can solve for N.\n\nLet me write that equation down:\n\n0.4*(16/(16 + N)) + 0.6*(N/(16 + N)) = 0.58\n\nSince both terms on the left have the same denominator, I can combine them:\n\n[0.4*16 + 0.6*N] / (16 + N) = 0.58\n\nLet me compute 0.4*16 first.\n\n0.4 * 16 = 6.4\n\nSo the numerator becomes 6.4 + 0.6N.\n\nSo the equation is:\n\n(6.4 + 0.6N) / (16 + N) = 0.58\n\nNow, to solve for N, I can cross-multiply:\n\n6.4 + 0.6N = 0.58*(16 + N)\n\nLet me compute 0.58*(16 + N):\n\nFirst, 0.58*16. Let me calculate that.\n\n0.58 * 16:\n16 * 0.5 = 8\n16 * 0.08 = 1.28\nSo, 8 + 1.28 = 9.28\n\nThen, 0.58*N is 0.58N.\n\nSo, the right side becomes 9.28 + 0.58N.\n\nNow, the equation is:\n\n6.4 + 0.6N = 9.28 + 0.58N\n\nLet me get all the N terms on one side and constants on the other.\n\nSubtract 0.58N from both sides:\n\n6.4 + 0.6N - 0.58N = 9.28\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n6.4 + 0.02N = 9.28\n\nNow, subtract 6.4 from both sides:\n\n0.02N = 9.28 - 6.4\n\nCalculate 9.28 - 6.4:\n\n9.28 - 6 = 3.28\n3.28 - 0.4 = 2.88\n\nSo, 0.02N = 2.88\n\nNow, to solve for N, divide both sides by 0.02:\n\nN = 2.88 / 0.02\n\nCalculating that:\n\n2.88 divided by 0.02 is the same as 2.88 multiplied by 50, since 1/0.02 = 50.\n\n2.88 * 50:\n\n2 * 50 = 100\n0.88 * 50 = 44\nSo, 100 + 44 = 144\n\nSo, N = 144\n\nWait, that seems a bit high, but let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting from the equation:\n\n6.4 + 0.6N = 9.28 + 0.58N\n\nSubtract 0.58N:\n\n6.4 + 0.02N = 9.28\n\nSubtract 6.4:\n\n0.02N = 2.88\n\nDivide by 0.02:\n\nN = 2.88 / 0.02 = 144\n\nHmm, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me double-check by plugging N = 144 back into the original probability equation to see if it gives 0.58.\n\nSo, Urn 2 has 16 green and 144 blue, so total balls = 16 + 144 = 160.\n\nP(G2) = 16/160 = 0.1\nP(B2) = 144/160 = 0.9\n\nNow, P(both green) = P(G1)*P(G2) = (4/10)*(16/160) = 0.4 * 0.1 = 0.04\n\nP(both blue) = P(B1)*P(B2) = (6/10)*(144/160) = 0.6 * 0.9 = 0.54\n\nAdding them together: 0.04 + 0.54 = 0.58\n\nYes, that checks out. So N = 144 is correct.\n\nWait, but let me think again. When I saw N=144, I was a bit surprised because that's a lot of blue balls in the second urn compared to green ones. But the probability checks out, so I guess that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this problem using fractions instead of decimals to see if I get the same result.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nSo, Urn 1 has 4G and 6B, so total 10. So, P(G1) = 4/10, P(B1) = 6/10.\n\nUrn 2 has 16G and N B, so total 16 + N.\n\nP(G2) = 16/(16 + N), P(B2) = N/(16 + N)\n\nSame color probability is P(both G) + P(both B) = (4/10)*(16/(16 + N)) + (6/10)*(N/(16 + N)) = 0.58\n\nBut 0.58 is 58/100, which can be simplified to 29/50.\n\nSo, let me write the equation as:\n\n(4/10)*(16/(16 + N)) + (6/10)*(N/(16 + N)) = 29/50\n\nLet me compute each term.\n\nFirst, 4/10 * 16/(16 + N) = (4*16)/(10*(16 + N)) = 64/(10*(16 + N)) = 32/(5*(16 + N))\n\nSecond term: 6/10 * N/(16 + N) = (6N)/(10*(16 + N)) = (3N)/(5*(16 + N))\n\nAdding them together:\n\n32/(5*(16 + N)) + 3N/(5*(16 + N)) = (32 + 3N)/(5*(16 + N)) = 29/50\n\nSo, cross-multiplying:\n\n(32 + 3N) * 50 = 29 * 5 * (16 + N)\n\nSimplify both sides:\n\nLeft side: 50*(32 + 3N) = 50*32 + 50*3N = 1600 + 150N\n\nRight side: 29*5*(16 + N) = 145*(16 + N) = 145*16 + 145N = 2320 + 145N\n\nSo, equation is:\n\n1600 + 150N = 2320 + 145N\n\nSubtract 145N from both sides:\n\n1600 + 5N = 2320\n\nSubtract 1600 from both sides:\n\n5N = 720\n\nDivide both sides by 5:\n\nN = 720 / 5 = 144\n\nSame result as before. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic mistakes, let me go through the cross-multiplication step again.\n\nWe had:\n\n(32 + 3N)/(5*(16 + N)) = 29/50\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\n(32 + 3N)*50 = 29*5*(16 + N)\n\nCalculating left side: 50*(32 + 3N) = 50*32 + 50*3N = 1600 + 150N\n\nRight side: 29*5 = 145, so 145*(16 + N) = 145*16 + 145N\n\n145*16: Let me compute that again.\n\n100*16 = 1600\n40*16 = 640\n5*16 = 80\nSo, 1600 + 640 = 2240, plus 80 is 2320.\n\nSo, right side is 2320 + 145N\n\nThus, equation:\n\n1600 + 150N = 2320 + 145N\n\nSubtract 145N:\n\n1600 + 5N = 2320\n\nSubtract 1600:\n\n5N = 720\n\nN = 720 / 5 = 144\n\nYes, that's correct. So N is 144.\n\nWait, but let me just think about whether this makes sense in terms of probability.\n\nIn Urn 2, with 16 green and 144 blue, the probability of drawing green is 16/160 = 0.1, which is 10%, and blue is 0.9, which is 90%.\n\nSo, the probability that both balls are green is 0.4 (from Urn 1) * 0.1 (from Urn 2) = 0.04\n\nProbability both blue is 0.6 (from Urn 1) * 0.9 (from Urn 2) = 0.54\n\nAdding those together: 0.04 + 0.54 = 0.58, which matches the given probability.\n\nSo, yes, N = 144 is correct.\n\nI think I've checked this thoroughly, so I'm confident that N is 144.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of \\( N \\) is \\boxed{144}.\n</think>\n\nGiven two urns, we need to find the value of \\( N \\) such that the probability of drawing balls of the same color from each urn is 0.58.\n\n- Urn 1 contains 4 green balls and 6 blue balls, totaling 10 balls.\n- Urn 2 contains 16 green balls and \\( N \\) blue balls, totaling \\( 16 + N \\) balls.\n\nThe probabilities of drawing a green or blue ball from each urn are:\n- \\( P(G1) = \\frac{4}{10} = 0.4 \\)\n- \\( P(B1) = \\frac{6}{10} = 0.6 \\)\n- \\( P(G2) = \\frac{16}{16 + N} \\)\n- \\( P(B2) = \\frac{N}{16 + N} \\)\n\nThe probability that both balls are the same color is the sum of the probabilities of both being green and both being blue:\n\\[ P(\\text{same color}) = P(G1) \\cdot P(G2) + P(B1) \\cdot P(B2) = 0.58 \\]\n\nSubstituting the probabilities:\n\\[ 0.4 \\cdot \\frac{16}{16 + N} + 0.6 \\cdot \\frac{N}{16 + N} = 0.58 \\]\n\nCombining the terms:\n\\[ \\frac{0.4 \\cdot 16 + 0.6 \\cdot N}{16 + N} = 0.58 \\]\n\\[ \\frac{6.4 + 0.6N}{16 + N} = 0.58 \\]\n\nCross-multiplying to solve for \\( N \\):\n\\[ 6.4 + 0.6N = 0.58 \\cdot (16 + N) \\]\n\\[ 6.4 + 0.6N = 9.28 + 0.58N \\]\n\\[ 0.02N = 2.88 \\]\n\\[ N = \\frac{2.88}{0.02} = 144 \\]\n\nThus, the value of \\( N \\) is \\(\\boxed{144}\\).",
