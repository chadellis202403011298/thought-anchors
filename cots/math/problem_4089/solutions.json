Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.\n\nThe problem says: Let \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) be complex numbers such that\n\\[\n\\frac{x + y}{x - y} + \\frac{x - y}{x + y} = 1.\n\\]\nWe need to find\n\\[\n\\frac{x^4 + y^4}{x^4 - y^4} + \\frac{x^4 - y^4}{x^4 + y^4}.\n\\]\nAlright, so we're given an equation involving \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), and we need to compute another expression based on \\( x^4 \\) and \\( y^4 \\). It seems like we'll need to manipulate the given equation to find some relationship between \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), and then use that to compute the desired expression.\n\nLet me start by looking at the given equation:\n\\[\n\\frac{x + y}{x - y} + \\frac{x - y}{x + y} = 1.\n\\]\nHmm, this looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can simplify it. I notice that both terms on the left side are fractions with denominators \\( x - y \\) and \\( x + y \\). Perhaps I can combine them by finding a common denominator.\n\nThe common denominator would be \\( (x - y)(x + y) \\), which is \\( x^2 - y^2 \\). So let me rewrite both fractions with this common denominator.\n\nFirst term:\n\\[\n\\frac{x + y}{x - y} = \\frac{(x + y)^2}{(x - y)(x + y)} = \\frac{(x + y)^2}{x^2 - y^2}.\n\\]\nSecond term:\n\\[\n\\frac{x - y}{x + y} = \\frac{(x - y)^2}{(x - y)(x + y)} = \\frac{(x - y)^2}{x^2 - y^2}.\n\\]\nSo when we add these together:\n\\[\n\\frac{(x + y)^2 + (x - y)^2}{x^2 - y^2} = 1.\n\\]\nLet me compute the numerator:\n\\[\n(x + y)^2 + (x - y)^2 = (x^2 + 2xy + y^2) + (x^2 - 2xy + y^2) = 2x^2 + 2y^2.\n\\]\nSo the equation becomes:\n\\[\n\\frac{2x^2 + 2y^2}{x^2 - y^2} = 1.\n\\]\nI can factor out a 2 in the numerator:\n\\[\n\\frac{2(x^2 + y^2)}{x^2 - y^2} = 1.\n\\]\nHmm, let's write this as:\n\\[\n2(x^2 + y^2) = x^2 - y^2.\n\\]\nWait, that seems a bit odd. Let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting from the given equation:\n\\[\n\\frac{x + y}{x - y} + \\frac{x - y}{x + y} = 1.\n\\]\nCombined the fractions:\n\\[\n\\frac{(x + y)^2 + (x - y)^2}{(x - y)(x + y)} = 1.\n\\]\nWhich simplifies to:\n\\[\n\\frac{x^2 + 2xy + y^2 + x^2 - 2xy + y^2}{x^2 - y^2} = 1.\n\\]\nSo that's:\n\\[\n\\frac{2x^2 + 2y^2}{x^2 - y^2} = 1.\n\\]\nYes, that's correct. So moving on, I have:\n\\[\n2x^2 + 2y^2 = x^2 - y^2.\n\\]\nWait, that would mean:\n\\[\n2x^2 + 2y^2 = x^2 - y^2.\n\\]\nSubtracting \\( x^2 \\) from both sides:\n\\[\nx^2 + 2y^2 = -y^2.\n\\]\nWait, that would imply:\n\\[\nx^2 + 3y^2 = 0.\n\\]\nHmm, that seems strange. Let me check my algebra again.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake when moving terms around. Let's take it step by step.\n\nWe have:\n\\[\n\\frac{2(x^2 + y^2)}{x^2 - y^2} = 1.\n\\]\nSo, cross-multiplying, we get:\n\\[\n2(x^2 + y^2) = (x^2 - y^2) \\times 1.\n\\]\nWhich is:\n\\[\n2x^2 + 2y^2 = x^2 - y^2.\n\\]\nNow, subtract \\( x^2 \\) from both sides:\n\\[\n2x^2 - x^2 + 2y^2 = -y^2.\n\\]\nWhich simplifies to:\n\\[\nx^2 + 2y^2 = -y^2.\n\\]\nThen, adding \\( y^2 \\) to both sides:\n\\[\nx^2 + 3y^2 = 0.\n\\]\nSo, \\( x^2 = -3y^2 \\).\n\nHmm, so that's an important relationship between \\( x \\) and \\( y \\). Since \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are complex numbers, this is possible because we can have negative squares in complex numbers.\n\nSo, \\( x^2 = -3y^2 \\). Let me write that as \\( x^2 = -3y^2 \\).\n\nNow, our goal is to find:\n\\[\n\\frac{x^4 + y^4}{x^4 - y^4} + \\frac{x^4 - y^4}{x^4 + y^4}.\n\\]\nLet me denote this expression as \\( E \\). So,\n\\[\nE = \\frac{x^4 + y^4}{x^4 - y^4} + \\frac{x^4 - y^4}{x^4 + y^4}.\n\\]\nI can see that this expression is similar in structure to the given equation, but with higher powers of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\). Maybe I can use the relationship \\( x^2 = -3y^2 \\) to express \\( x^4 \\) in terms of \\( y^4 \\).\n\nLet me compute \\( x^4 \\):\nSince \\( x^2 = -3y^2 \\), squaring both sides gives:\n\\[\nx^4 = (x^2)^2 = (-3y^2)^2 = 9y^4.\n\\]\nSo, \\( x^4 = 9y^4 \\).\n\nNow, let's substitute \\( x^4 = 9y^4 \\) into the expression \\( E \\).\n\nFirst, compute \\( x^4 + y^4 \\):\n\\[\nx^4 + y^4 = 9y^4 + y^4 = 10y^4.\n\\]\nNext, compute \\( x^4 - y^4 \\):\n\\[\nx^4 - y^4 = 9y^4 - y^4 = 8y^4.\n\\]\nSo, substituting into \\( E \\):\n\\[\nE = \\frac{10y^4}{8y^4} + \\frac{8y^4}{10y^4}.\n\\]\nSimplify each term by canceling \\( y^4 \\) (assuming \\( y \\neq 0 \\), which I think is safe here because if \\( y = 0 \\), then from \\( x^2 = -3y^2 \\), \\( x = 0 \\), which would make the original fractions undefined due to division by zero. So, \\( y \\neq 0 \\)).\n\nSo, simplifying:\n\\[\nE = \\frac{10}{8} + \\frac{8}{10}.\n\\]\nSimplify the fractions:\n\\[\n\\frac{10}{8} = \\frac{5}{4}, \\quad \\frac{8}{10} = \\frac{4}{5}.\n\\]\nSo, \\( E = \\frac{5}{4} + \\frac{4}{5} \\).\n\nTo add these, find a common denominator, which is 20:\n\\[\n\\frac{5}{4} = \\frac{25}{20}, \\quad \\frac{4}{5} = \\frac{16}{20}.\n\\]\nSo,\n\\[\nE = \\frac{25}{20} + \\frac{16}{20} = \\frac{41}{20}.\n\\]\nTherefore, the value of the expression is \\( \\frac{41}{20} \\).\n\nLet me just quickly recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\n1. Started with the given equation, combined the fractions, and simplified to find \\( x^2 = -3y^2 \\).\n2. Used that to find \\( x^4 = 9y^4 \\).\n3. Substituted into the desired expression and simplified each term, leading to \\( E = \\frac{5}{4} + \\frac{4}{5} = \\frac{41}{20} \\).\n\nI think that makes sense. I don't see any errors in the steps.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{\\dfrac{41}{20}}\n</think>\n\nGiven the equation:\n\\[\n\\frac{x + y}{x - y} + \\frac{x - y}{x + y} = 1,\n\\]\nwe start by combining the fractions:\n\\[\n\\frac{(x + y)^2 + (x - y)^2}{(x - y)(x + y)} = 1.\n\\]\nSimplifying the numerator:\n\\[\n(x + y)^2 + (x - y)^2 = x^2 + 2xy + y^2 + x^2 - 2xy + y^2 = 2x^2 + 2y^2.\n\\]\nThus, the equation becomes:\n\\[\n\\frac{2x^2 + 2y^2}{x^2 - y^2} = 1.\n\\]\nCross-multiplying, we get:\n\\[\n2(x^2 + y^2) = x^2 - y^2.\n\\]\nSimplifying, we find:\n\\[\n2x^2 + 2y^2 = x^2 - y^2 \\implies x^2 + 3y^2 = 0 \\implies x^2 = -3y^2.\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find:\n\\[\n\\frac{x^4 + y^4}{x^4 - y^4} + \\frac{x^4 - y^4}{x^4 + y^4}.\n\\]\nUsing \\( x^2 = -3y^2 \\), we compute \\( x^4 \\):\n\\[\nx^4 = (x^2)^2 = (-3y^2)^2 = 9y^4.\n\\]\nSubstituting \\( x^4 = 9y^4 \\) into the expression, we get:\n\\[\n\\frac{9y^4 + y^4}{9y^4 - y^4} + \\frac{9y^4 - y^4}{9y^4 + y^4} = \\frac{10y^4}{8y^4} + \\frac{8y^4}{10y^4}.\n\\]\nSimplifying each term:\n\\[\n\\frac{10}{8} + \\frac{8}{10} = \\frac{5}{4} + \\frac{4}{5}.\n\\]\nFinding a common denominator:\n\\[\n\\frac{5}{4} = \\frac{25}{20}, \\quad \\frac{4}{5} = \\frac{16}{20}.\n\\]\nAdding these fractions:\n\\[\n\\frac{25}{20} + \\frac{16}{20} = \\frac{41}{20}.\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\dfrac{41}{20}}\n\\]",
