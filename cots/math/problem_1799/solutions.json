If I randomly select two plates to serve dinner on, what is the probability that they're both the same color? Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this problem here: I have 5 red plates and 4 blue plates. I need to find the probability that if I randomly select two plates, they're both the same color. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that probability is generally the number of successful outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, I need to figure out how many ways there are to pick two plates of the same color, and then divide that by the total number of ways to pick any two plates.\n\nLet me start by calculating the total number of plates. There are 5 red and 4 blue, so that's 5 + 4 = 9 plates in total.\n\nNow, when selecting two plates, the total number of possible outcomes is the number of combinations of 9 plates taken 2 at a time. The formula for combinations is n choose k, which is n! / (k! * (n - k)!). So, 9 choose 2 would be 9! / (2! * (9 - 2)!) = (9 * 8) / (2 * 1) = 72 / 2 = 36. So, there are 36 possible ways to choose any two plates.\n\nNext, I need to find the number of successful outcomes, which are the cases where both plates are the same color. This can happen in two ways: both plates are red or both are blue. I'll calculate each separately and then add them together.\n\nStarting with the red plates: there are 5 red plates, so the number of ways to choose 2 red plates is 5 choose 2. Using the combination formula again, that's 5! / (2! * (5 - 2)!) = (5 * 4) / (2 * 1) = 20 / 2 = 10. So, 10 ways to pick two red plates.\n\nNow, for the blue plates: there are 4 blue plates, so the number of ways to choose 2 blue plates is 4 choose 2. Applying the same formula, that's 4! / (2! * (4 - 2)!) = (4 * 3) / (2 * 1) = 12 / 2 = 6. So, 6 ways to pick two blue plates.\n\nAdding the two together, the total number of successful outcomes is 10 (red) + 6 (blue) = 16.\n\nNow, the probability is the successful outcomes divided by total outcomes, which is 16 / 36. I can simplify this fraction by dividing numerator and denominator by 4: 16 \u00f7 4 = 4, 36 \u00f7 4 = 9. So, the probability is 4/9.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Total plates: 9, total combinations: 36, that seems right. Red combinations: 10, blue: 6, total same color: 16. 16/36 simplifies to 4/9. Yeah, that looks correct.\n\nI think that's the answer. The probability of selecting two plates of the same color is 4/9.\n</think>\n\nThe probability of selecting two plates of the same color is calculated by determining the number of successful outcomes (both plates red or both blue) divided by the total number of possible outcomes when choosing any two plates. \n\nTotal plates: 5 red + 4 blue = 9 plates.\n\nTotal ways to choose 2 plates: \\( \\binom{9}{2} = 36 \\).\n\nWays to choose 2 red plates: \\( \\binom{5}{2} = 10 \\).\n\nWays to choose 2 blue plates: \\( \\binom{4}{2} = 6 \\).\n\nTotal successful outcomes: 10 + 6 = 16.\n\nProbability: \\( \\frac{16}{36} = \\frac{4}{9} \\).\n\nFinal Answer: The probability is \\boxed{\\dfrac{4}{9}}.",
