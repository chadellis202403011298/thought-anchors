Problem: Let $a,$ $b,$ $c$ be the roots of the cubic polynomial $x^3 - x - 1 = 0.$  Find\n\\[a(b - c)^2 + b(c - a)^2 + c(a - b)^2.\\] Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this math problem here. It says that a, b, and c are the roots of the cubic polynomial x\u00b3 - x - 1 = 0. I need to find the value of the expression a(b - c)\u00b2 + b(c - a)\u00b2 + c(a - b)\u00b2. Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but I think I can break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, since a, b, and c are the roots of the polynomial x\u00b3 - x - 1, I can use Vieta's formulas to find the sums and products of the roots. Vieta's formulas relate the coefficients of a polynomial to sums and products of its roots. For a cubic equation like x\u00b3 + px\u00b2 + qx + r = 0, the formulas are:\n\n1. a + b + c = -p\n2. ab + bc + ca = q\n3. abc = -r\n\nIn our case, the polynomial is x\u00b3 - x - 1, which means p = 0, q = -1, and r = -1. So applying Vieta's formulas:\n\n1. a + b + c = 0\n2. ab + bc + ca = -1\n3. abc = 1\n\nAlright, that's a good start. Now, let's look at the expression we need to compute: a(b - c)\u00b2 + b(c - a)\u00b2 + c(a - b)\u00b2. Hmm, this looks symmetric in a, b, c, but not entirely symmetric because each term is weighted by a different variable. Let me try expanding each term to see if I can simplify the expression.\n\nLet's start by expanding (b - c)\u00b2, (c - a)\u00b2, and (a - b)\u00b2.\n\nFirst, (b - c)\u00b2 = b\u00b2 - 2bc + c\u00b2\nSimilarly, (c - a)\u00b2 = c\u00b2 - 2ca + a\u00b2\nAnd (a - b)\u00b2 = a\u00b2 - 2ab + b\u00b2\n\nSo, substituting back into the original expression:\n\na(b\u00b2 - 2bc + c\u00b2) + b(c\u00b2 - 2ca + a\u00b2) + c(a\u00b2 - 2ab + b\u00b2)\n\nNow, let's distribute each term:\n\n= a*b\u00b2 - 2a*bc + a*c\u00b2 + b*c\u00b2 - 2b*ca + b*a\u00b2 + c*a\u00b2 - 2c*ab + c*b\u00b2\n\nNow, let's rearrange the terms to group similar terms together:\n\n= (a*b\u00b2 + b*a\u00b2) + (a*c\u00b2 + c*a\u00b2) + (b*c\u00b2 + c*b\u00b2) - 2a*bc - 2b*ca - 2c*ab\n\nWait, let me check that. Hmm, maybe it's better to collect like terms step by step.\n\nLooking at the terms:\n\n1. a*b\u00b2\n2. -2a*bc\n3. a*c\u00b2\n4. b*c\u00b2\n5. -2b*ca\n6. b*a\u00b2\n7. c*a\u00b2\n8. -2c*ab\n9. c*b\u00b2\n\nSo, let's group the terms with similar variables:\n\nFirst, the a*b\u00b2 and b*a\u00b2: these are a*b\u00b2 + b*a\u00b2 = a\u00b2b + ab\u00b2. Similarly, a*c\u00b2 + c*a\u00b2 = a\u00b2c + a c\u00b2, and b*c\u00b2 + c*b\u00b2 = b\u00b2c + bc\u00b2.\n\nThen, the negative terms: -2a*bc -2b*ca -2c*ab. Let's note that each of these is -2abc, but multiplied by each variable once.\n\nWait, actually, each term is -2 times a product of two variables and the third. Let me write them as:\n\n-2abc (a + b + c). Wait, is that correct? Let me see.\n\nWait, no. Let's factor out -2abc from each term. Let's see:\n\n-2a*bc -2b*ca -2c*ab = -2abc (a + b + c). Because:\n\n-2a*bc = -2abc * a? Wait, no. Wait, -2a*bc is -2abc * 1, but if I factor out -2abc, then:\n\n-2a*bc = -2abc * (a / a) ? Hmm, maybe that's not the right approach. Let me think.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to note that each term is -2abc times a, b, c respectively. But that might not be directly helpful. Alternatively, maybe we can factor out -2abc from each term, but that might not be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can express the entire expression in terms of symmetric sums. Let's see.\n\nLet me first collect the positive terms:\n\na*b\u00b2 + a*c\u00b2 + b*c\u00b2 + b*a\u00b2 + c*a\u00b2 + c*b\u00b2.\n\nThis can be written as (a\u00b2b + ab\u00b2) + (a\u00b2c + ac\u00b2) + (b\u00b2c + bc\u00b2).\n\nI recall that a\u00b2b + ab\u00b2 = ab(a + b), similarly for the others. So:\n\n= ab(a + b) + ac(a + c) + bc(b + c)\n\nBut since a + b + c = 0, we can express a + b = -c, a + c = -b, and b + c = -a.\n\nSo substituting these in:\n\n= ab*(-c) + ac*(-b) + bc*(-a)\n= -abc - abc - abc\n= -3abc\n\nWait, that's interesting. So the positive terms add up to -3abc.\n\nNow, let's look at the negative terms:\n\n-2a*bc -2b*ca -2c*ab\n\nEach of these terms is -2 times abc times a, but wait, that's not exactly correct because:\n\n-2a*bc = -2abc\nSimilarly, -2b*ca = -2abc\nAnd -2c*ab = -2abc\n\nSo each term is -2abc, so adding them together:\n\n-2abc -2abc -2abc = -6abc\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because each term is -2abc, so three times that would be -6abc. So the total negative part is -6abc.\n\nWait, but wait, let's check:\n\nWait, the negative terms are:\n\n-2a*bc = -2abc\n\n-2b*ca = -2abc\n\n-2c*ab = -2abc\n\nSo adding them up: -2abc -2abc -2abc = -6abc.\n\nSo now, putting it all together:\n\nThe entire expression is positive terms + negative terms:\n\nPositive terms: -3abc\n\nNegative terms: -6abc\n\nWait, that would make the entire expression:\n\n-3abc -6abc = -9abc\n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check my steps again because I might have made a mistake.\n\nWait, in the positive terms, I had:\n\n(a*b\u00b2 + b*a\u00b2) + (a*c\u00b2 + c*a\u00b2) + (b*c\u00b2 + c*b\u00b2) = ab(a + b) + ac(a + c) + bc(b + c)\n\nSince a + b = -c, a + c = -b, and b + c = -a, so substituting:\n\n= ab*(-c) + ac*(-b) + bc*(-a) = -abc - abc - abc = -3abc\n\nThat's correct.\n\nThen the negative terms: -2a*bc -2b*ca -2c*ab = -2abc -2abc -2abc = -6abc\n\nSo total expression: -3abc -6abc = -9abc\n\nNow, from Vieta's formula, we know that abc = 1, so substituting that in:\n\n-9abc = -9*1 = -9\n\nWait, so the value of the expression is -9? Hmm, that seems straightforward, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the expansion.\n\nWait, let me go back and check the expansion again.\n\nOriginal expression: a(b - c)^2 + b(c - a)^2 + c(a - b)^2\n\nExpanding each square:\n\n= a(b\u00b2 - 2bc + c\u00b2) + b(c\u00b2 - 2ca + a\u00b2) + c(a\u00b2 - 2ab + b\u00b2)\n\nExpanding each term:\n\n= a*b\u00b2 - 2a*bc + a*c\u00b2 + b*c\u00b2 - 2b*ca + b*a\u00b2 + c*a\u00b2 - 2c*ab + c*b\u00b2\n\nNow, grouping similar terms:\n\n= (a*b\u00b2 + b*a\u00b2) + (a*c\u00b2 + c*a\u00b2) + (b*c\u00b2 + c*b\u00b2) - 2a*bc - 2b*ca - 2c*ab\n\nWhich is:\n\n= ab(a + b) + ac(a + c) + bc(b + c) - 2abc(a + b + c)\n\nWait, wait, that's a different way to group the terms. Because:\n\n-2a*bc -2b*ca -2c*ab = -2abc(a + b + c)\n\nBecause each term is -2abc times a, -2abc times b, etc. So factoring out -2abc, we get -2abc(a + b + c).\n\nSo, now, the entire expression can be written as:\n\nab(a + b) + ac(a + c) + bc(b + c) - 2abc(a + b + c)\n\nBut from Vieta's, a + b + c = 0, so the last term becomes 0.\n\nSo we're left with ab(a + b) + ac(a + c) + bc(b + c)\n\nAs before, since a + b = -c, a + c = -b, b + c = -a, this becomes:\n\nab*(-c) + ac*(-b) + bc*(-a) = -abc - abc - abc = -3abc\n\nWhich is the same as before. So then, the entire expression is -3abc.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the negative terms added up to -6abc, but now I'm seeing that the negative terms are actually part of the expression, and when I group them, they form -2abc(a + b + c) which is zero because a + b + c = 0.\n\nWait, that's conflicting with my earlier conclusion. So which one is correct?\n\nLet me go back.\n\nOriginal expression after expansion:\n\n= a*b\u00b2 + a*c\u00b2 + b*c\u00b2 + b*a\u00b2 + c*a\u00b2 + c*b\u00b2 - 2a*bc - 2b*ca - 2c*ab\n\nNow, if I group the first six terms as (a*b\u00b2 + b*a\u00b2) + (a*c\u00b2 + c*a\u00b2) + (b*c\u00b2 + c*b\u00b2), each of these pairs can be written as ab(a + b), ac(a + c), bc(b + c), which is -3abc as before.\n\nThen, the last three terms are -2a*bc -2b*ca -2c*ab, which is -2abc(a + b + c). But since a + b + c = 0, this term is zero.\n\nSo the entire expression is just -3abc.\n\nWait, that's different from my initial calculation where I thought the negative terms added up to -6abc. So now I'm confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial grouping. Let me clarify.\n\nWhen I expanded the original expression, I had:\n\n= a*b\u00b2 + a*c\u00b2 + b*c\u00b2 + b*a\u00b2 + c*a\u00b2 + c*b\u00b2 - 2a*bc - 2b*ca - 2c*ab\n\nNow, let's group the terms as follows:\n\n= (a*b\u00b2 + b*a\u00b2) + (a*c\u00b2 + c*a\u00b2) + (b*c\u00b2 + c*b\u00b2) - 2a*bc - 2b*ca - 2c*ab\n\nNow, each of the first three pairs is ab(a + b) etc., which gives us -3abc as before.\n\nThe last three terms: -2a*bc -2b*ca -2c*ab. Let's factor out -2abc from each term:\n\n= -2abc(a + b + c)\n\nBut since a + b + c = 0, this is zero.\n\nSo the entire expression is -3abc.\n\nWait, so that's different from my initial thought where I thought the negative terms added up to -6abc. It seems I made a mistake there by not correctly recognizing that the negative terms sum to zero.\n\nTherefore, the correct value of the expression is -3abc, which, since abc = 1, is -3*1 = -3.\n\nWait, but that contradicts my earlier conclusion of -9. Hmm, I must have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, let me check again.\n\nWait, when I expanded the original expression, I had:\n\n= a*b\u00b2 + a*c\u00b2 + b*c\u00b2 + b*a\u00b2 + c*a\u00b2 + c*b\u00b2 - 2a*bc - 2b*ca - 2c*ab\n\nNow, when I group the terms as (a*b\u00b2 + b*a\u00b2) + (a*c\u00b2 + c*a\u00b2) + (b*c\u00b2 + c*b\u00b2), each of these is ab(a + b), which is ab*(-c), as a + b = -c.\n\nSimilarly for the others, so:\n\n= ab*(-c) + ac*(-b) + bc*(-a) = -abc - abc - abc = -3abc\n\nThen, the remaining terms are -2a*bc -2b*ca -2c*ab, which is -2abc(a + b + c). Since a + b + c = 0, this term is zero.\n\nSo, the entire expression is -3abc.\n\nSince abc = 1, the expression equals -3*1 = -3.\n\nWait, so that's different from my initial calculation where I thought the negative terms added up to -6abc. It seems I made a mistake there by not correctly recognizing that the negative terms sum to zero because a + b + c = 0.\n\nSo, the correct answer is -3.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Maybe I should try another approach to confirm.\n\nAnother approach could be to express the given expression in terms of symmetric sums.\n\nLet me denote S = a(b - c)^2 + b(c - a)^2 + c(a - b)^2\n\nI can expand each term:\n\nS = a(b\u00b2 - 2bc + c\u00b2) + b(c\u00b2 - 2ca + a\u00b2) + c(a\u00b2 - 2ab + b\u00b2)\n\nExpanding:\n\n= a b\u00b2 - 2 a b c + a c\u00b2 + b c\u00b2 - 2 b c a + b a\u00b2 + c a\u00b2 - 2 c a b + c b\u00b2\n\nNow, let's collect like terms:\n\n= (a b\u00b2 + b a\u00b2) + (a c\u00b2 + c a\u00b2) + (b c\u00b2 + c b\u00b2) - 2 a b c - 2 b c a - 2 c a b\n\nSimplify each pair:\n\n= ab(a + b) + ac(a + c) + bc(b + c) - 6 a b c\n\nBecause each of the last three terms is -2abc, so three times that is -6abc.\n\nNow, using a + b + c = 0, we have a + b = -c, a + c = -b, b + c = -a.\n\nSo substituting:\n\n= ab*(-c) + ac*(-b) + bc*(-a) - 6abc\n= -abc - abc - abc - 6abc\n= -3abc - 6abc\n= -9abc\n\nSince abc = 1, this becomes -9*1 = -9.\n\nWait, now I'm getting a different answer: -9. Hmm, so which approach is correct?\n\nWait, in the first approach, I thought the negative terms summed to zero, but in the second approach, I treated them as -6abc.\n\nI must have made a mistake in one of the steps.\n\nWait, in the second approach, when I collected the terms, I had:\n\n-2abc -2abc -2abc = -6abc\n\nSo that's correct. Then, the positive terms were:\n\nab(a + b) + ac(a + c) + bc(b + c) = -3abc\n\nSo total expression is -3abc -6abc = -9abc\n\nWhich would be -9, since abc = 1.\n\nSo that seems to be the correct answer. But why in the first approach, when I grouped the terms, I thought the negative terms summed to zero?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the first approach by incorrectly grouping the terms.\n\nWait, let's see. In the first approach, I wrote the entire expression as:\n\n= ab(a + b) + ac(a + c) + bc(b + c) - 2abc(a + b + c)\n\nWhich is correct because:\n\n-2a*bc -2b*ca -2c*ab = -2abc(a + b + c)\n\nSince a + b + c = 0, this term is zero, so the expression is just ab(a + b) + ac(a + c) + bc(b + c) = -3abc\n\nBut in the second approach, I treated the negative terms as -6abc, leading to -9abc.\n\nSo which is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps the error is in how I grouped the terms.\n\nWait, in the first approach, I considered the expression as:\n\n= [ab(a + b) + ac(a + c) + bc(b + c)] - 2abc(a + b + c)\n\nWhich is correct because:\n\n= ab(a + b) + ac(a + c) + bc(b + c) - 2a*bc - 2b*ca - 2c*ab\n\nWhich is the same as:\n\n= ab(a + b) + ac(a + c) + bc(b + c) - 2abc(a + b + c)\n\nWhich, since a + b + c = 0, reduces to -3abc.\n\nBut in the second approach, I treated the negative terms as -6abc, leading to -9abc.\n\nWait, but that's inconsistent. So I must have made a mistake in the second approach.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify.\n\nWhen I expand S, I get:\n\n= a b\u00b2 + a c\u00b2 + b c\u00b2 + b a\u00b2 + c a\u00b2 + c b\u00b2 - 2 a b c - 2 b c a - 2 c a b\n\nNow, the terms -2abc -2abc -2abc are indeed -6abc.\n\nSo that's correct. Then, the positive terms:\n\na b\u00b2 + b a\u00b2 = ab(a + b) = ab*(-c)\nSimilarly, a c\u00b2 + c a\u00b2 = ac*(-b)\nAnd b c\u00b2 + c b\u00b2 = bc*(-a)\nSo that's -abc -abc -abc = -3abc\n\nSo total expression: -3abc -6abc = -9abc = -9\n\nSo that's correct. Therefore, the first approach was wrong because I incorrectly thought that the negative terms summed to zero, but in reality, the negative terms are -6abc, not dependent on a + b + c.\n\nWait, but in the first approach, I had:\n\nS = [ab(a + b) + ac(a + c) + bc(b + c)] - 2abc(a + b + c)\n\nWhich is correct, because:\n\n= ab(a + b) + ac(a + c) + bc(b + c) - 2a b c - 2b c a - 2c a b\n\n= ab(a + b) + ac(a + c) + bc(b + c) - 2abc(a + b + c)\n\nBut since a + b + c = 0, the last term is zero, so S = -3abc.\n\nBut in the second approach, I treated the negative terms as -6abc, which seems contradictory.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the first approach by not correctly expanding the terms.\n\nWait, let's check:\n\nWhen I expanded S, I had:\n\n= a b\u00b2 + a c\u00b2 + b c\u00b2 + b a\u00b2 + c a\u00b2 + c b\u00b2 - 2 a b c - 2 b c a - 2 c a b\n\nNow, the terms -2abc -2abc -2abc are indeed -6abc, so the expression is:\n\n= (a b\u00b2 + b a\u00b2 + a c\u00b2 + c a\u00b2 + b c\u00b2 + c b\u00b2) - 6abc\n\nWhich can be written as:\n\n= [ab(a + b) + ac(a + c) + bc(b + c)] - 6abc\n\nNow, since a + b = -c, etc., we have:\n\n= [ab*(-c) + ac*(-b) + bc*(-a)] - 6abc\n= (-abc - abc - abc) - 6abc\n= (-3abc) - 6abc\n= -9abc\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the mistake in the first approach was that I thought the negative terms were -2abc(a + b + c), which is zero, but that's not correct because the negative terms are -6abc, not -2abc(a + b + c).\n\nWait, no, actually, let's see:\n\nThe negative terms are -2a*bc -2b*ca -2c*ab, which is equal to -2abc(a + b + c). But since a + b + c = 0, this term is zero.\n\nWait, but that contradicts the other approach where we have -6abc.\n\nSo which is correct?\n\nWait, let's compute -2a*bc -2b*ca -2c*ab:\n\n= -2abc -2abc -2abc = -6abc\n\nBut also, -2a*bc -2b*ca -2c*ab = -2abc(a + b + c) because:\n\n= -2abc*(a + b + c)\n\nBut since a + b + c = 0, this is zero.\n\nBut that can't be because -6abc is not zero unless abc = 0, which it's not.\n\nThis is a contradiction. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my factoring.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\n-2a*bc -2b*ca -2c*ab = -2abc -2abc -2abc = -6abc\n\nBut also, factoring:\n\n= -2abc(a + b + c)\n\nBut since a + b + c = 0, this is zero. So that would mean that -6abc = 0, which is impossible because abc = 1.\n\nTherefore, my mistake must be in the factoring step. Let's see:\n\n-2a*bc -2b*ca -2c*ab\n\n= -2abc -2abc -2abc\n\n= -6abc\n\nBut also, factoring:\n\n= -2abc(a + b + c)\n\nBut since a + b + c = 0, this equals zero. So that suggests that -6abc = 0, which is impossible.\n\nTherefore, I must have made a mistake in the factoring. Let's see:\n\nWait, -2a*bc is -2abc, yes.\n\nSimilarly, -2b*ca is -2abc, and -2c*ab is -2abc.\n\nSo total: -6abc.\n\nBut when I factor out -2abc, I get:\n\n= -2abc(a + b + c)\n\nBut since a + b + c = 0, this is zero, which would imply that -6abc = 0, which is impossible because abc = 1.\n\nTherefore, my mistake is in the factoring. It should not be -2abc(a + b + c), because each term is -2abc, but the variables are different.\n\nWait, actually, no. Let me think again.\n\nWait, each term is -2abc, but when I factor out -2abc, I have to see if the remaining terms add up to (a + b + c).\n\nWait, let me write it as:\n\n-2a*bc = -2abc\n\nSimilarly, -2b*ca = -2abc\n\nAnd -2c*ab = -2abc\n\nSo, each term is -2abc, so adding them together:\n\n-2abc -2abc -2abc = -6abc\n\nBut if I try to factor out -2abc, I get:\n\n= -2abc(a + b + c)\n\nBut that's only possible if each term inside is a, b, c respectively. But in reality, each term is -2abc, so the sum is -6abc.\n\nTherefore, the correct way is that the sum is -6abc, not -2abc(a + b + c). So my initial factoring was incorrect. Therefore, the correct expression is -9abc, which is -9.\n\nSo, the correct answer is -9.\n\nWait, but in the first approach, I thought that the negative terms summed to zero, which was incorrect because the factoring was wrong. So the correct value is indeed -9.\n\nTherefore, the value of the expression is -9.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{-9}\n</think>\n\nGiven the cubic polynomial \\(x^3 - x - 1 = 0\\) with roots \\(a, b, c\\), we need to find the value of the expression \\(a(b - c)^2 + b(c - a)^2 + c(a - b)^2\\).\n\nFirst, we use Vieta's formulas for the polynomial:\n1. \\(a + b + c = 0\\)\n2. \\(ab + bc + ca = -1\\)\n3. \\(abc = 1\\)\n\nWe start by expanding the given expression:\n\\[\na(b - c)^2 + b(c - a)^2 + c(a - b)^2\n\\]\n\nExpanding each term:\n\\[\na(b^2 - 2bc + c^2) + b(c^2 - 2ca + a^2) + c(a^2 - 2ab + b^2)\n\\]\n\nDistributing and combining like terms:\n\\[\n= ab^2 + ac^2 + bc^2 + ba^2 + ca^2 + cb^2 - 2abc - 2abc - 2abc\n\\]\n\nGrouping the terms:\n\\[\n= (ab^2 + ba^2) + (ac^2 + ca^2) + (bc^2 + cb^2) - 6abc\n\\]\n\nUsing the fact that \\(a + b + c = 0\\), we substitute \\(a + b = -c\\), \\(a + c = -b\\), and \\(b + c = -a\\):\n\\[\n= ab(-c) + ac(-b) + bc(-a) - 6abc\n\\]\n\\[\n= -abc - abc - abc - 6abc\n\\]\n\\[\n= -3abc - 6abc\n\\]\n\\[\n= -9abc\n\\]\n\nSince \\(abc = 1\\), we substitute:\n\\[\n-9abc = -9 \\times 1 = -9\n\\]\n\nThus, the value of the expression is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{-9}\n\\]",
