Problem: Daniel works at an electronics store, and he claims that the popularity of a toaster (measured in number of sales) is inversely proportional to its cost. If 12 customers buy a toaster that costs $\\$500$, according to Daniel's theory, how many customers would buy a toaster that costs $\\$750$? Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.\n\nThe problem says that Daniel works at an electronics store and claims that the popularity of a toaster, measured by the number of sales, is inversely proportional to its cost. So, if one toaster costs $500 and 12 customers buy it, according to Daniel's theory, how many customers would buy a toaster that costs $750?\n\nAlright, so let's break this down. First, the key concept here is inverse proportionality. From what I remember, if two things are inversely proportional, it means that as one increases, the other decreases in such a way that their product is a constant. So, mathematically, if A is inversely proportional to B, we can write that as A = k/B, where k is the constant of proportionality.\n\nIn this problem, the popularity, which is the number of customers buying the toaster, is inversely proportional to the cost of the toaster. So, let me assign variables to these things to make it clearer.\n\nLet me denote the number of customers as P (for popularity) and the cost of the toaster as C. So, according to the problem, P is inversely proportional to C, which means P = k/C, where k is the constant of proportionality.\n\nNow, we're given that when C is $500, P is 12 customers. So, I can plug these values into the equation to find k.\n\nSo, substituting the given values, we have:\n\n12 = k / 500\n\nTo solve for k, I can multiply both sides of the equation by 500.\n\n12 * 500 = k\n\nCalculating that, 12 times 500 is 6000. So, k = 6000.\n\nNow that I have the constant k, I can write the general equation for P as:\n\nP = 6000 / C\n\nThis equation tells me that the number of customers is equal to 6000 divided by the cost of the toaster.\n\nNow, the question is asking how many customers would buy a toaster that costs $750. So, I need to find P when C is $750.\n\nUsing the equation I just derived, I can plug in C = 750.\n\nSo, P = 6000 / 750\n\nNow, let me compute that. 6000 divided by 750.\n\nHmm, let me think about how to compute this. Well, 750 times 8 is 6000 because 750 times 2 is 1500, times 4 is 3000, so times 8 is 6000. So, 6000 divided by 750 is 8.\n\nTherefore, P = 8.\n\nSo, according to Daniel's theory, if the toaster costs $750, then 8 customers would buy it.\n\nWait, let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting from the beginning, if P is inversely proportional to C, then P = k/C.\n\nGiven P = 12 when C = 500, so 12 = k/500, so k = 12 * 500 = 6000. That seems correct.\n\nThen, for C = 750, P = 6000 / 750.\n\nLet me compute that again: 750 goes into 6000 how many times?\n\n750 * 8 = 6000, as I thought earlier. So, 8 is the correct answer.\n\nAnother way to think about it is using the inverse proportionality. Since P1 * C1 = P2 * C2, because the product of P and C is constant.\n\nSo, 12 * 500 = P2 * 750.\n\nCalculating 12 * 500: 12 * 500 = 6000.\n\nSo, 6000 = P2 * 750.\n\nThen, P2 = 6000 / 750 = 8.\n\nYep, that checks out. So, I think 8 is the correct number of customers.\n\nI don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I feel confident that the answer is 8 customers.\n</think>\n\nThe number of customers is inversely proportional to the cost of the toaster. Using the given data, we determine the constant of proportionality and find that when the cost increases to $750, the number of customers decreases to 8.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Understand Inverse Proportionality:** If two quantities are inversely proportional, their product is a constant. So, if P is the number of customers and C is the cost, then P = k/C, where k is a constant.\n\n2. **Find the Constant k:** Given that when C = $500, P = 12 customers.\n   \\[\n   12 = \\frac{k}{500} \\implies k = 12 \\times 500 = 6000\n   \\]\n\n3. **Formulate the General Equation:** Now, the equation relating P and C is:\n   \\[\n   P = \\frac{6000}{C}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate for C = $750:** Substitute C = 750 into the equation.\n   \\[\n   P = \\frac{6000}{750} = 8\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{8}",
