Problem: Find all solutions to the equation\\[ \\sqrt[4]{x} = \\frac{12}{7 - \\sqrt[4]{x}}.\\] Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this equation to solve: the fourth root of x equals 12 divided by (7 minus the fourth root of x). Hmm, that looks a bit tricky, but let me see if I can figure it out step by step.\n\nFirst, I should probably write down the equation to make it clearer. So, it's \u221a\u2074x = 12 / (7 - \u221a\u2074x). I'm going to let y equal \u221a\u2074x because that seems like it might simplify things. So, substituting y in, the equation becomes y = 12 / (7 - y). That looks a bit easier to handle.\n\nNow, I have y = 12 / (7 - y). To solve for y, I can cross-multiply or maybe just multiply both sides by (7 - y) to get rid of the denominator. Let's try that. Multiplying both sides by (7 - y) gives me y*(7 - y) = 12. Expanding the left side, that's 7y - y\u00b2 = 12.\n\nHmm, okay, so now I have a quadratic equation: -y\u00b2 + 7y - 12 = 0. I can rearrange that to make it a bit more standard, so let's write it as y\u00b2 - 7y + 12 = 0. Wait, no, because if I move everything to the other side, it becomes y\u00b2 - 7y + 12 = 0. Is that right? Let me check: starting from 7y - y\u00b2 = 12, subtracting 12 from both sides gives -y\u00b2 + 7y - 12 = 0, which is the same as y\u00b2 - 7y + 12 = 0 if I multiply both sides by -1. But actually, when I move terms across the equals sign, I should change their signs. So, 7y - y\u00b2 - 12 = 0 becomes -y\u00b2 + 7y - 12 = 0, which is equivalent to y\u00b2 - 7y + 12 = 0 when multiplied by -1. But I think it's better to keep it as -y\u00b2 + 7y - 12 = 0 because then I can factor it more easily, maybe.\n\nWait, let me think again. Let's take the equation y*(7 - y) = 12, which becomes 7y - y\u00b2 = 12. Then, rearranged, it's -y\u00b2 + 7y - 12 = 0. Alternatively, multiplying both sides by -1, we get y\u00b2 - 7y + 12 = 0. Either way, I can factor this quadratic.\n\nLooking at y\u00b2 - 7y + 12, I need two numbers that multiply to 12 and add up to -7. Hmm, 12 can be factored into 3 and 4, which add up to 7. But since the middle term is -7y, the factors should both be negative. So, (y - 3)(y - 4) = 0. Therefore, the solutions are y = 3 and y = 4.\n\nWait, let me check that. If I expand (y - 3)(y - 4), I get y\u00b2 - 4y - 3y + 12, which is y\u00b2 -7y +12. Perfect, that's correct.\n\nSo, y can be 3 or 4. But remember, y was defined as \u221a\u2074x, so \u221a\u2074x = 3 or \u221a\u2074x = 4.\n\nNow, to solve for x, I need to raise both sides to the fourth power because the fourth root is the inverse operation. So, if \u221a\u2074x = 3, then x = 3^4. Similarly, if \u221a\u2074x = 4, then x = 4^4.\n\nCalculating those, 3^4 is 81, and 4^4 is 256. So, x could be 81 or 256.\n\nBut wait, I should check these solutions in the original equation to make sure they don't cause any issues, like division by zero or taking even roots of negative numbers, which aren't real. Let's check x = 81 first.\n\nPlugging x = 81 into the original equation: \u221a\u207481 = 3, and the denominator is 7 - \u221a\u207481 = 7 - 3 = 4. So, 3 = 12 / 4, which is 3 = 3. That works.\n\nNow, checking x = 256: \u221a\u2074256 = 4, and the denominator is 7 - 4 = 3. So, 4 = 12 / 3, which is 4 = 4. That also works.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the substitution. When I set y = \u221a\u2074x, I assumed that \u221a\u2074x is a real number, so x must be non-negative. Both 81 and 256 are positive, so that's fine. Also, when I solved for y, I got y = 3 and y = 4, which are both positive, so that's good because the fourth root of x is always non-negative in real numbers.\n\nIs there any possibility of other solutions? Well, when we squared or did operations, sometimes extraneous solutions can pop up, but in this case, both solutions worked when I checked them, so I think we're good.\n\nJust to recap, the steps were:\n\n1. Let y = \u221a\u2074x to simplify the equation.\n2. Substitute y into the equation to get y = 12 / (7 - y).\n3. Multiply both sides by (7 - y) to eliminate the denominator, resulting in a quadratic equation.\n4. Solve the quadratic equation for y, getting y = 3 and y = 4.\n5. Substitute back to find x by raising y to the fourth power, giving x = 81 and x = 256.\n6. Verify both solutions in the original equation to ensure they're valid.\n\nI don't think I missed anything here. Both solutions are valid, and the steps seem solid. So, the solutions are x = 81 and x = 256.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe solutions are \\boxed{81} and \\boxed{256}.\n</think>\n\nLet \\( y = \\sqrt[4]{x} \\).
