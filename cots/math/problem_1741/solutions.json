Problem: Find the sum of the coefficients in the polynomial $-2(x^7 - x^4 + 3x^2 - 5) + 4(x^3 + 2x) - 3(x^5 - 4)$. Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the sum of the coefficients in this polynomial: -2(x^7 - x^4 + 3x^2 - 5) + 4(x^3 + 2x) - 3(x^5 - 4). Hmm, let's see. I remember that the sum of the coefficients in a polynomial can be found by plugging in x = 1. That should simplify everything, right? So maybe I can just substitute 1 for every x and then calculate the result. Let me try that.\n\nFirst, I'll rewrite the polynomial with x = 1. So, substituting, I get:\n\n-2(1^7 - 1^4 + 3*1^2 - 5) + 4(1^3 + 2*1) - 3(1^5 - 4).\n\nNow, let me compute each part step by step.\n\nStarting with the first part: -2(1^7 - 1^4 + 3*1^2 - 5).\n\nCalculating each term inside the parentheses:\n\n1^7 is 1, because any number to the power of 1 is itself.\n\n-1^4 is -1, because 1^4 is 1, and the negative sign stays.\n\n3*1^2 is 3*1, which is 3.\n\nThen, -5 is just -5.\n\nSo putting that together: 1 - 1 + 3 - 5.\n\nLet me compute that: 1 - 1 is 0, 0 + 3 is 3, 3 - 5 is -2.\n\nSo the first part becomes -2*(-2). Wait, no, hold on. The entire expression inside the parentheses is -2 times that result. So, -2*(result). The result inside was -2, so -2*(-2) is 4.\n\nWait, no, maybe I messed that up. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, the first term is -2 multiplied by the entire expression (1^7 -1^4 +3*1^2 -5). So I calculated that inside as 1 -1 +3 -5, which is -2. So then, -2*(-2) is 4. Okay, that part is 4.\n\nNext, the second part is +4(1^3 + 2*1).\n\nCalculating inside the parentheses:\n\n1^3 is 1, and 2*1 is 2. So 1 + 2 is 3.\n\nThen, 4*3 is 12.\n\nSo the second part is 12.\n\nNow, the third part is -3(1^5 -4).\n\nCalculating inside the parentheses:\n\n1^5 is 1, so 1 -4 is -3.\n\nThen, -3*(-3) is 9.\n\nSo the third part is 9.\n\nNow, adding all three parts together: 4 + 12 + 9.\n\n4 + 12 is 16, and 16 + 9 is 25.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nAlternatively, I could expand the polynomial first and then sum the coefficients. Let me try that method to verify.\n\nStarting with the original polynomial: -2(x^7 - x^4 + 3x^2 - 5) + 4(x^3 + 2x) - 3(x^5 - 4).\n\nLet me distribute each term:\n\nFirst term: -2*x^7 is -2x^7.\n\n-2*(-x^4) is +2x^4.\n\n-2*3x^2 is -6x^2.\n\n-2*(-5) is +10.\n\nSecond term: 4*x^3 is 4x^3.\n\n4*2x is 8x.\n\nThird term: -3*x^5 is -3x^5.\n\n-3*(-4) is +12.\n\nNow, let me write all the terms out:\n\n-2x^7 + 2x^4 -6x^2 +10 +4x^3 +8x -3x^5 +12.\n\nNow, let's combine like terms. Wait, but since we're looking for the sum of the coefficients, maybe it's easier to collect all the coefficients and then add them up.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's more straightforward to just plug in x=1 as I did before, which gives the sum of the coefficients. So I think my first method is correct, and the sum is 25. But let me check again.\n\nWait, in the expansion method, let's see:\n\nThe terms after expansion are:\n\n-2x^7, +2x^4, -6x^2, +10, +4x^3, +8x, -3x^5, +12.\n\nNow, if I collect like terms, but since each term is unique in its power, maybe I can just list all the coefficients.\n\nBut since we're to find the sum of the coefficients, which is when x=1, so each term becomes the coefficient times 1, so just the coefficients added together.\n\nSo, the coefficients are:\n\n-2 (for x^7),\n\n+2 (for x^4),\n\n-6 (for x^2),\n\n+10 (constant term),\n\n+4 (for x^3),\n\n+8 (for x),\n\n-3 (for x^5),\n\n+12.\n\nNow, adding all these coefficients together:\n\n-2 + 2 = 0,\n\n0 -6 = -6,\n\n-6 +10 = 4,\n\n4 +4 = 8,\n\n8 +8 = 16,\n\n16 -3 = 13,\n\n13 +12 = 25.\n\nYes, same result. So that confirms it. So the sum of the coefficients is 25.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as evaluating the polynomial at x=1, which is exactly what I did first, so that's consistent.\n\nI think that's solid. So the answer is 25.\n</think>\n\nThe sum of the coefficients in the polynomial is found by evaluating the polynomial at x = 1. \n\nSubstituting x = 1 into each term:\n\n-2(1 - 1 + 3 - 5) + 4(1 + 2) - 3(1 - 4) = 4 + 12 + 9 = 25.\n\n**Answer:** The sum of the coefficients is \\boxed{25}.",
