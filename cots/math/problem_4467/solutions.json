Problem: The polynomial $ax^4 + bx^3 + 32x^2 - 16x + 6$ has a factor of $3x^2 - 2x + 1.$  Find the ordered pair $(a,b).$ Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this polynomial: \\( ax^4 + bx^3 + 32x^2 - 16x + 6 \\), and I know that it has a factor of \\( 3x^2 - 2x + 1 \\). I need to find the ordered pair \\( (a, b) \\). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, if \\( 3x^2 - 2x + 1 \\) is a factor of the given polynomial, that means when I divide the polynomial by \\( 3x^2 - 2x + 1 \\), there should be no remainder. So, maybe I can perform polynomial division here. Alternatively, I could express the given polynomial as the product of \\( 3x^2 - 2x + 1 \\) and another quadratic polynomial, since the given polynomial is a quartic (degree 4) and \\( 3x^2 - 2x + 1 \\) is quadratic (degree 2). That seems like a good approach because multiplying two quadratics gives a quartic.\n\nLet me denote the other quadratic factor as \\( cx^2 + dx + e \\). So, the product would be:\n\n\\( (3x^2 - 2x + 1)(cx^2 + dx + e) \\)\n\nWhen I multiply these two, I should get the original polynomial \\( ax^4 + bx^3 + 32x^2 - 16x + 6 \\). So, let me carry out the multiplication step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll distribute each term in the first polynomial across each term in the second polynomial.\n\nStarting with \\( 3x^2 \\) times \\( cx^2 + dx + e \\):\n- \\( 3x^2 \\cdot cx^2 = 3c x^{4} \\)\n- \\( 3x^2 \\cdot dx = 3d x^{3} \\)\n- \\( 3x^2 \\cdot e = 3e x^{2} \\)\n\nNext, \\( -2x \\) times \\( cx^2 + dx + e \\):\n- \\( -2x \\cdot cx^2 = -2c x^{3} \\)\n- \\( -2x \\cdot dx = -2d x^{2} \\)\n- \\( -2x \\cdot e = -2e x \\)\n\nFinally, \\( 1 \\) times \\( cx^2 + dx + e \\):\n- \\( 1 \\cdot cx^2 = c x^{2} \\)\n- \\( 1 \\cdot dx = d x \\)\n- \\( 1 \\cdot e = e \\)\n\nNow, I'll combine all these terms:\n\n- \\( 3c x^4 \\)\n- \\( (3d - 2c) x^3 \\)\n- \\( (3e - 2d + c) x^2 \\)\n- \\( (-2e + d) x \\)\n- \\( e \\)\n\nSo, the product is:\n\n\\( 3c x^4 + (3d - 2c) x^3 + (3e - 2d + c) x^2 + (-2e + d) x + e \\)\n\nNow, this should equal the original polynomial \\( ax^4 + bx^3 + 32x^2 - 16x + 6 \\). Therefore, the coefficients of corresponding terms should be equal. Let's set up equations based on that.\n\n1. Coefficient of \\( x^4 \\):\n\\( 3c = a \\)  \u2192 Equation (1)\n\n2. Coefficient of \\( x^3 \\):\n\\( 3d - 2c = b \\)  \u2192 Equation (2)\n\n3. Coefficient of \\( x^2 \\):\n\\( 3e - 2d + c = 32 \\)  \u2192 Equation (3)\n\n4. Coefficient of \\( x \\):\n\\( -2e + d = -16 \\)  \u2192 Equation (4)\n\n5. Constant term:\n\\( e = 6 \\)  \u2192 Equation (5)\n\nAlright, so starting with Equation (5), we have \\( e = 6 \\). Let me plug this into Equation (4) to find \\( d \\).\n\nPlugging \\( e = 6 \\) into Equation (4):\n\\( -2(6) + d = -16 \\)\n\\( -12 + d = -16 \\)\nAdding 12 to both sides:\n\\( d = -16 + 12 \\)\n\\( d = -4 \\)\n\nSo, \\( d = -4 \\). Now, let's plug \\( d = -4 \\) and \\( e = 6 \\) into Equation (3) to find \\( c \\).\n\nEquation (3):\n\\( 3(6) - 2(-4) + c = 32 \\)\n\\( 18 + 8 + c = 32 \\)\n\\( 26 + c = 32 \\)\nSubtracting 26 from both sides:\n\\( c = 6 \\)\n\nSo, \\( c = 6 \\). Now, using Equation (1), we can find \\( a \\).\n\nEquation (1):\n\\( 3c = a \\)\n\\( 3(6) = a \\)\n\\( a = 18 \\)\n\nNext, using Equation (2) to find \\( b \\).\n\nEquation (2):\n\\( 3d - 2c = b \\)\nPlugging in \\( d = -4 \\) and \\( c = 6 \\):\n\\( 3(-4) - 2(6) = b \\)\n\\( -12 - 12 = b \\)\n\\( b = -24 \\)\n\nLet me just double-check my work to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting from the beginning, we had:\n\n\\( (3x^2 - 2x + 1)(6x^2 - 4x + 6) \\)\n\nLet me multiply these to see if I get the original polynomial.\n\nFirst, \\( 3x^2 \\times 6x^2 = 18x^4 \\)\n\\( 3x^2 \\times (-4x) = -12x^3 \\)\n\\( 3x^2 \\times 6 = 18x^2 \\)\n\nNext, \\( -2x \\times 6x^2 = -12x^3 \\)\n\\( -2x \\times (-4x) = 8x^2 \\)\n\\( -2x \\times 6 = -12x \\)\n\nThen, \\( 1 \\times 6x^2 = 6x^2 \\)\n\\( 1 \\times (-4x) = -4x \\)\n\\( 1 \\times 6 = 6 \\)\n\nNow, adding all these terms together:\n\n- \\( 18x^4 \\)\n- \\( (-12x^3 -12x^3) = -24x^3 \\)\n- \\( (18x^2 + 8x^2 + 6x^2) = 32x^2 \\)\n- \\( (-12x -4x) = -16x \\)\n- \\( 6 \\)\n\nSo, the product is indeed \\( 18x^4 -24x^3 + 32x^2 -16x +6 \\), which matches the given polynomial. Therefore, my values for \\( a = 18 \\) and \\( b = -24 \\) are correct.\n\nI think that's all there is to it. I set up the equations correctly, solved for each variable step by step, and verified the result by expanding the product. Everything checks out.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe ordered pair is \\boxed{(18, -24)}.\n</think>\n\nGiven the polynomial \\( ax^4 + bx^3 + 32x^2 - 16x + 6 \\) and knowing it has a factor of \\( 3x^2 - 2x + 1 \\), we can express the polynomial as the product of \\( 3x^2 - 2x + 1 \\) and another quadratic polynomial \\( cx^2 + dx + e \\). \n\nExpanding the product:\n\n\\[\n(3x^2 - 2x + 1)(cx^2 + dx + e)\n\\]\n\nwe get:\n\n\\[\n3c x^4 + (3d - 2c) x^3 + (3e - 2d + c) x^2 + (-2e + d) x + e\n\\]\n\nMatching the coefficients with the given polynomial \\( ax^4 + bx^3 + 32x^2 - 16x + 6 \\), we set up the following equations:\n\n1. \\( 3c = a \\)\n2. \\( 3d - 2c = b \\)\n3. \\( 3e - 2d + c = 32 \\)\n4. \\( -2e + d = -16 \\)\n5. \\( e = 6 \\)\n\nFrom equation (5), we find \\( e = 6 \\). Substituting \\( e = 6 \\) into equation (4):\n\n\\[\n-2(6) + d = -16 \\implies -12 + d = -16 \\implies d = -4\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( d = -4 \\) and \\( e = 6 \\) into equation (3):\n\n\\[\n3(6) - 2(-4) + c = 32 \\implies 18 + 8 + c = 32 \\implies 26 + c = 32 \\implies c = 6\n\\]\n\nUsing \\( c = 6 \\) in equation (1):\n\n\\[\n3(6) = a \\implies a = 18\n\\]\n\nUsing \\( d = -4 \\) and \\( c = 6 \\) in equation (2):\n\n\\[\n3(-4) - 2(6) = b \\implies -12 - 12 = b \\implies b = -24\n\\]\n\nThus, the ordered pair is \\(\\boxed{(18, -24)}\\).",
