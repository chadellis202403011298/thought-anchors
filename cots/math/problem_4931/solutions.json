Problem: What is the least positive integer that satisfies the following conditions?\n\na) When divided by 2, the remainder is 1.\n\nb) When divided by 3, the remainder is 2.\n\nc) When divided by 4, the remainder is 3.\n\nd) When divided by 5, the remainder is 4. Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to find the least positive integer that satisfies four different conditions. Let me try to understand each condition one by one and see how I can approach solving it.\n\nFirst, let me list out the conditions again to make sure I have them clear:\n\na) When the number is divided by 2, the remainder is 1.\n\nb) When the number is divided by 3, the remainder is 2.\n\nc) When the number is divided by 4, the remainder is 3.\n\nd) When the number is divided by 5, the remainder is 4.\n\nHmm, interesting. So each time, when I divide this number by another number (2, 3, 4, 5), the remainder is one less than the divisor. Like, for 2 it's 1, which is 2-1; for 3 it's 2, which is 3-1; and so on. That seems like a pattern. Maybe that can help me find the number.\n\nLet me think about what this implies. If a number leaves a remainder of 1 less than the divisor when divided by it, that suggests that the number is one less than a multiple of each of these divisors. So, for example, if I take the number and add 1 to it, then it should be divisible by 2, 3, 4, and 5 without any remainder. Because if the original number is one less than a multiple, adding 1 would make it exactly that multiple.\n\nSo, mathematically, if N is the number I'm looking for, then:\n\nN + 1 should be divisible by 2, 3, 4, and 5.\n\nIn other words, N + 1 is a common multiple of 2, 3, 4, and 5. And since we're looking for the least such N, N + 1 should be the least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers. Then, N would be LCM(2, 3, 4, 5) - 1.\n\nOkay, that makes sense. So my next step is to find the LCM of 2, 3, 4, and 5.\n\nLet me recall how to find the LCM of multiple numbers. The LCM of a set of numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of each of them. To find it, I can break each number down into its prime factors and then take the highest power of each prime that appears in the factorizations.\n\nSo, let's factor each number:\n\n- 2 is a prime number, so its prime factorization is just 2.\n- 3 is also a prime number, so its prime factorization is 3.\n- 4 can be factored into 2^2.\n- 5 is a prime number, so its prime factorization is 5.\n\nNow, to find the LCM, I take the highest power of each prime that appears in these factorizations:\n\n- For 2, the highest power is 2^2 (from 4).\n- For 3, it's 3^1.\n- For 5, it's 5^1.\n\nSo, the LCM is 2^2 * 3^1 * 5^1.\n\nCalculating that: 2^2 is 4, 4 * 3 is 12, and 12 * 5 is 60. So, the LCM of 2, 3, 4, and 5 is 60.\n\nTherefore, N + 1 = 60, which means N = 60 - 1 = 59.\n\nWait a second, let me check if 59 actually satisfies all the original conditions to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with condition a: 59 divided by 2. 2 goes into 59 twenty-nine times with a remainder of 1. That's correct.\n\nCondition b: 59 divided by 3. 3 times 19 is 57, so the remainder is 2. That's right.\n\nCondition c: 59 divided by 4. 4 times 14 is 56, so the remainder is 3. Correct.\n\nCondition d: 59 divided by 5. 5 times 11 is 55, so the remainder is 4. Yep, that works too.\n\nSo, 59 does satisfy all four conditions. But wait, is 59 the smallest such number? Let me think if there's a smaller number that also meets all these conditions.\n\nSince the LCM of 2, 3, 4, 5 is 60, the next smallest number would be 60 - 1 = 59. If I try subtracting multiples of 60, like 60 - 1, 60 - 1 - 60 = -1, which isn't positive, so 59 is indeed the smallest positive integer that meets all these conditions.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me check numbers less than 59 to see if any of them satisfy all four conditions.\n\nLet's start with a smaller number and check each condition:\n\nTake 1: Divided by 2, remainder 1. Good. Divided by 3, remainder 1, which doesn't satisfy condition b (needs remainder 2). So, 1 is out.\n\nTake 3: Divided by 2, remainder 1. Good. Divided by 3, remainder 0, which isn't 2. So, no.\n\nTake 5: Divided by 2, remainder 1. Good. Divided by 3, remainder 2. Good. Divided by 4, remainder 1, which isn't 3. So, 5 doesn't work.\n\nTake 7: Divided by 2, remainder 1. Good. Divided by 3, remainder 1. Not 2. So, no.\n\nTake 9: Divided by 2, remainder 1. Good. Divided by 3, remainder 0. Not 2. So, no.\n\nTake 11: Divided by 2, remainder 1. Good. Divided by 3, remainder 2. Good. Divided by 4, remainder 3. Good. Divided by 5, remainder 1. Not 4. So, 11 fails condition d.\n\nTake 13: Divided by 2, remainder 1. Good. Divided by 3, remainder 1. Not 2. So, no.\n\nTake 15: Divided by 2, remainder 1. Good. Divided by 3, remainder 0. Not 2. So, no.\n\nTake 17: Divided by 2, remainder 1. Good. Divided by 3, remainder 2. Good. Divided by 4, remainder 1. Not 3. So, 17 fails condition c.\n\nTake 19: Divided by 2, remainder 1. Good. Divided by 3, remainder 1. Not 2. So, no.\n\nTake 21: Divided by 2, remainder 1. Good. Divided by 3, remainder 0. Not 2. So, no.\n\nTake 23: Divided by 2, remainder 1. Good. Divided by 3, remainder 2. Good. Divided by 4, remainder 3. Good. Divided by 5, remainder 3. Not 4. So, 23 fails condition d.\n\nTake 25: Divided by 2, remainder 1. Good. Divided by 3, remainder 1. Not 2. So, no.\n\nTake 27: Divided by 2, remainder 1. Good. Divided by 3, remainder 0. Not 2. So, no.\n\nTake 29: Divided by 2, remainder 1. Good. Divided by 3, remainder 2. Good. Divided by 4, remainder 1. Not 3. So, 29 fails condition c.\n\nTake 31: Divided by 2, remainder 1. Good. Divided by 3, remainder 1. Not 2. So, no.\n\nTake 33: Divided by 2, remainder 1. Good. Divided by 3, remainder 0. Not 2. So, no.\n\nTake 35: Divided by 2, remainder 1. Good. Divided by 3, remainder 2. Good. Divided by 4, remainder 3. Good. Divided by 5, remainder 0. Not 4. So, 35 fails condition d.\n\nTake 37: Divided by 2, remainder 1. Good. Divided by 3, remainder 1. Not 2. So, no.\n\nTake 39: Divided by 2, remainder 1. Good. Divided by 3, remainder 0. Not 2. So, no.\n\nTake 41: Divided by 2, remainder 1. Good. Divided by 3, remainder 2. Good. Divided by 4, remainder 1. Not 3. So, 41 fails condition c.\n\nTake 43: Divided by 2, remainder 1. Good. Divided by 3, remainder 1. Not 2. So, no.\n\nTake 45: Divided by 2, remainder 1. Good. Divided by 3, remainder 0. Not 2. So, no.\n\nTake 47: Divided by 2, remainder 1. Good. Divided by 3, remainder 2. Good. Divided by 4, remainder 3. Good. Divided by 5, remainder 2. Not 4. So, 47 fails condition d.\n\nTake 49: Divided by 2, remainder 1. Good. Divided by 3, remainder 1. Not 2. So, no.\n\nTake 51: Divided by 2, remainder 1. Good. Divided by 3, remainder 0. Not 2. So, no.\n\nTake 53: Divided by 2, remainder 1. Good. Divided by 3, remainder 2. Good. Divided by 4, remainder 1. Not 3. So, 53 fails condition c.\n\nTake 55: Divided by 2, remainder 1. Good. Divided by 3, remainder 1. Not 2. So, no.\n\nTake 57: Divided by 2, remainder 1. Good. Divided by 3, remainder 0. Not 2. So, no.\n\nTake 59: Divided by 2, remainder 1. Good. Divided by 3, remainder 2. Good. Divided by 4, remainder 3. Good. Divided by 5, remainder 4. Good. So, 59 works.\n\nWow, okay, so that took a while, but I checked each number less than 59 and none of them satisfied all four conditions. So, 59 is indeed the smallest positive integer that meets all the given requirements.\n\nAnother way I could approach this problem is by using modular arithmetic. Since each condition is a congruence, maybe I can solve them step by step using the Chinese Remainder Theorem or something similar.\n\nLet me try that approach to verify.\n\nStarting with condition a: N \u2261 1 mod 2.\n\nThat means N is odd. So, N can be written as 2k + 1 for some integer k.\n\nNow, moving to condition b: N \u2261 2 mod 3.\n\nSubstituting N from condition a: 2k + 1 \u2261 2 mod 3.\n\nSubtracting 1 from both sides: 2k \u2261 1 mod 3.\n\nNow, I need to solve for k. 2k \u2261 1 mod 3.\n\nTo find k, I can multiply both sides by the modular inverse of 2 mod 3. The inverse of 2 mod 3 is 2 because 2*2=4\u22611 mod 3.\n\nSo, multiplying both sides by 2: (2*2)k \u2261 2*1 mod 3 => 4k \u2261 2 mod 3.\n\nBut 4 \u2261 1 mod 3, so this simplifies to k \u2261 2 mod 3.\n\nSo, k can be written as 3m + 2 for some integer m.\n\nTherefore, N = 2k + 1 = 2*(3m + 2) + 1 = 6m + 5.\n\nSo now, N can be expressed as 6m + 5. Let's apply condition c: N \u2261 3 mod 4.\n\nSubstituting N: 6m + 5 \u2261 3 mod 4.\n\nSubtracting 5 from both sides: 6m \u2261 -2 mod 4, which is the same as 6m \u2261 2 mod 4.\n\nSimplify 6m mod 4: 6 \u2261 2 mod 4, so 2m \u2261 2 mod 4.\n\nDivide both sides by 2: m \u2261 1 mod 2.\n\nSo, m can be written as 2n + 1 for some integer n.\n\nSubstituting back into N: N = 6*(2n + 1) + 5 = 12n + 6 + 5 = 12n + 11.\n\nSo now, N can be written as 12n + 11. Now, apply condition d: N \u2261 4 mod 5.\n\nSubstituting N: 12n + 11 \u2261 4 mod 5.\n\nSubtracting 11 from both sides: 12n \u2261 -7 mod 5. Since -7 mod 5 is equivalent to 3 (because 5*2=10, so -7 + 10=3), so 12n \u2261 3 mod 5.\n\nSimplify 12 mod 5: 12 \u2261 2 mod 5, so 2n \u2261 3 mod 5.\n\nNow, solve for n: 2n \u2261 3 mod 5.\n\nMultiply both sides by the inverse of 2 mod 5. The inverse of 2 mod 5 is 3 because 2*3=6\u22611 mod 5.\n\nSo, multiplying both sides by 3: (2*3)n \u2261 3*3 mod 5 => 6n \u2261 9 mod 5.\n\nSimplify: 6 \u2261 1 mod 5, so 1n \u2261 4 mod 5 (since 9 mod 5 is 4). Therefore, n \u2261 4 mod 5.\n\nSo, n can be written as 5p + 4 for some integer p.\n\nSubstituting back into N: N = 12n + 11 = 12*(5p + 4) + 11 = 60p + 48 + 11 = 60p + 59.\n\nSo, N = 60p + 59. Since we're looking for the least positive integer, we take p=0, which gives N=59. If p=1, N=119, which is larger, so 59 is indeed the smallest.\n\nThis method also leads me to the same answer, 59, so that reinforces that 59 is the correct solution.\n\nI think I've covered both approaches: first by recognizing the pattern that N + 1 must be a multiple of the LCM of 2,3,4,5, and second by solving the system of congruences step by step using modular arithmetic and substitution. Both methods led me to the same conclusion, so I'm confident that 59 is the correct answer.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't overlook anything, let me think about the problem one more time. The key insight was noticing that each remainder was one less than the divisor, which made me realize that adding 1 to N would make it divisible by all the divisors. That's a really useful pattern to recognize because it simplifies the problem significantly by turning it into finding the LCM.\n\nAnother thing I could consider is whether there are any smaller numbers that fit all the conditions, but as I checked each number below 59, none of them worked. So, 59 is indeed the smallest. It's also good to verify using two different methods because sometimes one method might have a flaw, but in this case, both methods align perfectly.\n\nI guess another way to look at it is that N is one less than a multiple of each divisor, so N + 1 is a multiple of each divisor. Therefore, N + 1 must be the least common multiple of 2,3,4,5, which is 60. So, N is 59. That's straightforward.\n\nIt's interesting how recognizing patterns can make these problems much easier. Instead of trying each number one by one, which is time-consuming, spotting that N + 1 is a multiple of all the divisors allows me to jump straight to the solution using LCM.\n\nI think I've thought this through thoroughly, and I'm confident that 59 is the correct answer. It satisfies all the given conditions, and both methods of solving confirm that it's the smallest such number.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires finding the smallest positive integer that leaves a remainder of one less than the divisor when divided by 2, 3, 4, and 5. \n\nBy analyzing the conditions, we observe that the number plus one must be divisible by each of these divisors. This leads us to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 2, 3, 4, and 5, which is 60. Subtracting one from this LCM gives the desired number.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:**\n   - Each condition states that when the number is divided by \\( n \\), the remainder is \\( n - 1 \\).\n   - Therefore, the number \\( N \\) can be expressed as \\( N = k \\times n - 1 \\) for each divisor \\( n \\).\n\n2. **Find the Least Common Multiple (LCM):**\n   - The LCM of 2, 3, 4, and 5 is calculated by taking the highest powers of their prime factors:\n     - \\( 2 = 2 \\)\n     - \\( 3 = 3 \\)\n     - \\( 4 = 2^2 \\)\n     - \\( 5 = 5 \\)\n   - LCM \\( = 2^2 \\times 3 \\times 5 = 60 \\).\n\n3. **Determine the Number:**\n   - Since \\( N + 1 \\) must be the LCM, \\( N = 60 - 1 = 59 \\).\n\n4. **Verification:**\n   - Check each condition:\n     - \\( 59 \\div 2 \\) leaves remainder 1.\n     - \\( 59 \\div 3 \\) leaves remainder 2.\n     - \\( 59 \\div 4 \\) leaves remainder 3.\n     - \\( 59 \\div 5 \\) leaves remainder 4.\n   - All conditions are satisfied.\n\n**Answer:**\nThe least positive integer is \\boxed{59}.",
