Problem: Find the number of positive solutions to\n\\[\\sin (\\arccos( \\tan (\\arcsin x) ) ) ) = x.\\] Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this trigonometric equation to solve: \\(\\sin (\\arccos( \\tan (\\arcsin x) ) ) ) = x\\). Hmm, that looks a bit complicated with all those inverse trig functions nested inside each other. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand each part of the equation. The equation is \\(\\sin (\\arccos( \\tan (\\arcsin x) ) ) ) = x\\). So, starting from the inside, we have \\(\\arcsin x\\). I know that \\(\\arcsin x\\) gives me an angle whose sine is x. The range of \\(\\arcsin\\) is \\([-\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2]\\), but since we're looking for positive solutions, x must be between 0 and 1, right? Because \\(\\arcsin x\\) for x positive will give an angle between 0 and \u03c0/2.\n\nNext, inside the equation, we have \\(\\tan (\\arcsin x)\\). So, if I let \u03b8 = \\(\\arcsin x\\), then \u03b8 is between 0 and \u03c0/2, and \\(\\tan \u03b8\\) would be \\(\\sin \u03b8 / \\cos \u03b8\\). Since \\(\\sin \u03b8 = x\\), I can express \\(\\tan \u03b8\\) in terms of x.\n\nLet me write this down:\n\nLet \u03b8 = \\(\\arcsin x\\), so \u03b8 \u2208 [0, \u03c0/2].\n\nThen, \\(\\tan \u03b8 = \\sin \u03b8 / \\cos \u03b8 = x / \\cos \u03b8\\).\n\nBut I need to express \\(\\cos \u03b8\\) in terms of x. Since \\(\\sin^2 \u03b8 + \\cos^2 \u03b8 = 1\\), so \\(\\cos \u03b8 = \\sqrt{1 - x^2}\\). Since \u03b8 is in the first quadrant, cosine is positive.\n\nSo, \\(\\tan \u03b8 = x / \\sqrt{1 - x^2}\\).\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\n\\(\\sin (\\arccos( \\tan (\\arcsin x) ) ) = x\\)\n\nWhich is:\n\n\\(\\sin (\\arccos( x / \\sqrt{1 - x^2} )) = x\\)\n\nNow, let me let \u03c6 = \\(\\arccos( x / \\sqrt{1 - x^2} )\\). So, \u03c6 is the angle whose cosine is \\(x / \\sqrt{1 - x^2}\\). The range of \\(\\arccos\\) is [0, \u03c0], so \u03c6 is between 0 and \u03c0.\n\nTherefore, \\(\\cos \u03c6 = x / \\sqrt{1 - x^2}\\), and we can find \\(\\sin \u03c6\\) because we know that \\(\\sin^2 \u03c6 + \\cos^2 \u03c6 = 1\\).\n\nSo, \\(\\sin \u03c6 = \\sqrt{1 - \\cos^2 \u03c6}\\). Let me compute that.\n\n\\(\\cos \u03c6 = x / \\sqrt{1 - x^2}\\), so \\(\\cos^2 \u03c6 = x^2 / (1 - x^2)\\).\n\nThen, \\(\\sin^2 \u03c6 = 1 - x^2 / (1 - x^2) = (1 - x^2 - x^2) / (1 - x^2) = (1 - 2x^2) / (1 - x^2)\\).\n\nWait, that seems a bit off. Let me check my algebra.\n\nWait, 1 - (x^2 / (1 - x^2)) = [ (1 - x^2) - x^2 ] / (1 - x^2) = (1 - 2x^2) / (1 - x^2). Yeah, that's correct.\n\nSo, \\(\\sin \u03c6 = \\sqrt{(1 - 2x^2) / (1 - x^2)}\\). Hmm, but since \u03c6 is in [0, \u03c0], sine is non-negative, so we can take the positive square root.\n\nBut, wait, we have to ensure that the expression inside the square root is non-negative. So, (1 - 2x^2) / (1 - x^2) \u2265 0.\n\nLet me consider the numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: 1 - 2x^2 \u2265 0 \u21d2 x^2 \u2264 1/2 \u21d2 |x| \u2264 \u221a(1/2) \u2248 0.707.\n\nDenominator: 1 - x^2 > 0 \u21d2 x^2 < 1 \u21d2 |x| < 1.\n\nSince we're considering positive solutions, x \u2208 (0, \u221a(1/2)].\n\nSo, the expression under the square root is non-negative only when x \u2264 \u221a(1/2).\n\nSo, \\(\\sin \u03c6 = \\sqrt{(1 - 2x^2) / (1 - x^2)}\\).\n\nBut the original equation is \\(\\sin \u03c6 = x\\), so:\n\n\\(\\sqrt{(1 - 2x^2) / (1 - x^2)} = x\\)\n\nLet me square both sides to eliminate the square root:\n\n(1 - 2x^2) / (1 - x^2) = x^2\n\nMultiply both sides by (1 - x^2):\n\n1 - 2x^2 = x^2 (1 - x^2)\n\nExpand the right side:\n\n1 - 2x^2 = x^2 - x^4\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n1 - 2x^2 - x^2 + x^4 = 0 \u21d2 1 - 3x^2 + x^4 = 0\n\nLet me write it as:\n\nx^4 - 3x^2 + 1 = 0\n\nHmm, that's a quartic equation, but it's quadratic in terms of y = x^2. Let me substitute y = x^2:\n\ny^2 - 3y + 1 = 0\n\nNow, solve for y using quadratic formula:\n\ny = [3 \u00b1 \u221a(9 - 4)] / 2 = [3 \u00b1 \u221a5] / 2\n\nSo, y = [3 + \u221a5]/2 \u2248 (3 + 2.236)/2 \u2248 5.236/2 \u2248 2.618\n\nOr y = [3 - \u221a5]/2 \u2248 (3 - 2.236)/2 \u2248 0.764/2 \u2248 0.382\n\nBut y = x^2, and since x is positive and in (0, \u221a(1/2)] \u2248 (0, 0.707], so y must be \u2264 (\u221a(1/2))^2 = 1/2 = 0.5.\n\nSo, y = [3 + \u221a5]/2 \u2248 2.618 is greater than 0.5, which is outside our domain. So we discard that.\n\nThe other solution is y = [3 - \u221a5]/2 \u2248 0.381966, which is less than 0.5, so that's acceptable.\n\nTherefore, x^2 = [3 - \u221a5]/2 \u21d2 x = sqrt([3 - \u221a5]/2)\n\nSince x is positive, we take the positive square root.\n\nWait, let me compute sqrt([3 - \u221a5]/2). Let me see if this can be simplified.\n\nLet me compute [3 - \u221a5]/2 numerically to check:\n\n\u221a5 \u2248 2.236, so 3 - 2.236 \u2248 0.764. Then, 0.764 / 2 \u2248 0.382. So sqrt(0.382) \u2248 0.618, which is approximately the golden ratio conjugate.\n\nWait, I think sqrt([3 - \u221a5]/2) is equal to (sqrt(5) - 1)/2. Let me check:\n\nLet me compute (sqrt(5) - 1)/2 \u2248 (2.236 - 1)/2 \u2248 1.236/2 \u2248 0.618, which matches the square root of 0.382. Let me square (sqrt(5) - 1)/2:\n\n[(sqrt(5) - 1)/2]^2 = (5 - 2sqrt(5) + 1)/4 = (6 - 2sqrt(5))/4 = (3 - sqrt(5))/2, which is correct. So, yes, sqrt([3 - sqrt(5)]/2) = (sqrt(5) - 1)/2.\n\nSo, x = (sqrt(5) - 1)/2 \u2248 0.618, which is less than \u221a(1/2) \u2248 0.707, so it's within our domain.\n\nWait, but let me check if this is the only solution. Because when we squared both sides, sometimes extraneous solutions can be introduced, so I need to verify.\n\nSo, let me plug x = (sqrt(5) - 1)/2 into the original equation and see if it holds.\n\nFirst, compute arcsin x. Since x \u2248 0.618, which is within [-1,1], so \u03b8 = arcsin(0.618) \u2248 0.666 radians (since sin(\u03c0/4) \u2248 0.707, which is a bit higher, so maybe around 0.666).\n\nThen, tan \u03b8 = tan(arcsin x) = x / sqrt(1 - x^2). Let's compute sqrt(1 - x^2):\n\nx = (sqrt(5) - 1)/2 \u2248 0.618, so x^2 \u2248 0.618^2 \u2248 0.3819.\n\nThen, 1 - x^2 \u2248 1 - 0.3819 \u2248 0.6181, so sqrt(1 - x^2) \u2248 sqrt(0.6181) \u2248 0.786.\n\nThen, tan \u03b8 \u2248 0.618 / 0.786 \u2248 0.786. Wait, that's approximately 0.786, which is sqrt(0.618), but let me check more accurately.\n\nWait, let me compute exact values.\n\nSince x = (sqrt(5) - 1)/2, then x^2 = [(sqrt(5) - 1)/2]^2 = (5 - 2sqrt(5) + 1)/4 = (6 - 2sqrt(5))/4 = (3 - sqrt(5))/2.\n\nSo, 1 - x^2 = 1 - (3 - sqrt(5))/2 = (2 - 3 + sqrt(5))/2 = (-1 + sqrt(5))/2.\n\nSo, sqrt(1 - x^2) = sqrt( (-1 + sqrt(5))/2 ). Let me compute that:\n\nsqrt( (sqrt(5) - 1)/2 ) = ?\n\nWait, actually, that's exactly equal to x, because x = (sqrt(5) - 1)/2, so sqrt(1 - x^2) = sqrt( (sqrt(5) - 1)/2 ) = x.\n\nWait, no, because sqrt(a) is positive, and x is positive, so sqrt( (sqrt(5) - 1)/2 ) = x. Therefore, sqrt(1 - x^2) = x. Therefore, tan \u03b8 = x / sqrt(1 - x^2) = x / x = 1.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, tan \u03b8 = 1, which implies \u03b8 = \u03c0/4, because tan(\u03c0/4) = 1.\n\nWait, but if \u03b8 = arcsin x, and x = (sqrt(5) - 1)/2 \u2248 0.618, then arcsin(0.618) is approximately 0.666 radians, which is more than \u03c0/4 (\u22480.785 radians). Wait, no, 0.666 is less than \u03c0/4 \u2248 0.785. Wait, actually, 0.666 is about 38 degrees, while \u03c0/4 is 45 degrees. Wait, no, 0.666 radians is about 38 degrees, and \u03c0/4 is about 45 degrees. So, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, if tan \u03b8 = 1, then \u03b8 would be \u03c0/4. But if \u03b8 = arcsin x, then x = sin(\u03c0/4) = sqrt(2)/2 \u2248 0.707, which is higher than our x \u2248 0.618. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps.\n\nWait, let me go back. I found that x = (sqrt(5) - 1)/2, which is approximately 0.618. Then, when I compute tan \u03b8, where \u03b8 = arcsin x, I get tan \u03b8 = x / sqrt(1 - x^2).\n\nBut earlier, I thought that sqrt(1 - x^2) = x, but that's only if 1 - x^2 = x^2, which would mean 1 = 2x^2, so x^2 = 1/2, x = sqrt(2)/2 \u2248 0.707. But in our case, x is (sqrt(5)-1)/2 \u2248 0.618, so 1 - x^2 \u2248 0.618, which is not equal to x^2 \u2248 0.3819.\n\nWait, maybe I confused something earlier. Let me recompute:\n\nWe have x = (sqrt(5) - 1)/2 \u2248 0.618.\n\nThen, x^2 \u2248 0.618^2 \u2248 0.3819.\n\nSo, 1 - x^2 \u2248 1 - 0.3819 \u2248 0.6181.\n\nSo, sqrt(1 - x^2) \u2248 sqrt(0.6181) \u2248 0.786.\n\nThen, tan \u03b8 = x / sqrt(1 - x^2) \u2248 0.618 / 0.786 \u2248 0.786. Wait, that's approximately 0.786, which is approximately 1/sqrt(2) \u2248 0.707, but not exactly. Wait, maybe I should compute it exactly.\n\nWait, let's compute tan \u03b8 exactly.\n\nGiven x = (sqrt(5) - 1)/2, then tan \u03b8 = x / sqrt(1 - x^2).\n\nWe have x^2 = (3 - sqrt(5))/2, so 1 - x^2 = 1 - (3 - sqrt(5))/2 = (2 - 3 + sqrt(5))/2 = (-1 + sqrt(5))/2.\n\nSo, sqrt(1 - x^2) = sqrt( (-1 + sqrt(5))/2 ).\n\nLet me compute tan \u03b8:\n\ntan \u03b8 = x / sqrt(1 - x^2) = [ (sqrt(5) - 1)/2 ] / sqrt( (sqrt(5) - 1)/2 )\n\nLet me write sqrt(a)/b as sqrt(a)/sqrt(b^2), but perhaps I can rationalize this.\n\nWait, let me compute this fraction:\n\nLet me denote a = sqrt(5) - 1, so x = a/2, and sqrt(1 - x^2) = sqrt(a/2).\n\nSo, tan \u03b8 = (a/2) / sqrt(a/2) = (a/2) * sqrt(2/a) = (a/2) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(a) = (a * sqrt(2)) / (2 * sqrt(a)) )\n\nSimplify sqrt(a) = sqrt(sqrt(5) - 1), so:\n\n= (sqrt(2) * sqrt(a)) / 2\n\n= sqrt(2a)/2\n\nNow, 2a = 2(sqrt(5) - 1) = 2sqrt(5) - 2.\n\nSo, sqrt(2a) = sqrt(2sqrt(5) - 2). Hmm, that seems complicated, but perhaps we can compute it numerically.\n\nWait, alternatively, let me compute tan \u03b8 = x / sqrt(1 - x^2):\n\nx = (sqrt(5) - 1)/2 \u2248 (2.236 - 1)/2 \u2248 1.236/2 \u2248 0.618\n\nsqrt(1 - x^2) \u2248 sqrt(1 - 0.618^2) \u2248 sqrt(1 - 0.3819) \u2248 sqrt(0.6181) \u2248 0.786\n\nSo, tan \u03b8 \u2248 0.618 / 0.786 \u2248 0.786, which is approximately 0.786.\n\nWait, but 0.786 is approximately tan(38 degrees) or so. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps.\n\nWait, but let's proceed. So, \u03c6 = arccos(tan \u03b8). So, \u03c6 = arccos(0.786). Let me compute that.\n\ncos \u03c6 = 0.786, so \u03c6 \u2248 arccos(0.786) \u2248 0.666 radians, which is about 38 degrees.\n\nThen, sin \u03c6 = x \u2248 0.618.\n\nWait, but if \u03c6 \u2248 0.666 radians, then sin \u03c6 \u2248 sin(0.666) \u2248 0.618, which matches x. So, that works.\n\nWait, but let me check the exact value.\n\nWe had:\n\nsin \u03c6 = x = (sqrt(5) - 1)/2.\n\nAnd we had:\n\nsin \u03c6 = sqrt( (1 - 2x^2)/(1 - x^2) )\n\nWait, let me compute (1 - 2x^2)/(1 - x^2):\n\nx^2 = (3 - sqrt(5))/2, so 2x^2 = 3 - sqrt(5).\n\nThus, 1 - 2x^2 = 1 - (3 - sqrt(5)) = 1 - 3 + sqrt(5) = -2 + sqrt(5).\n\nAnd 1 - x^2 = (-1 + sqrt(5))/2, as before.\n\nSo, (1 - 2x^2)/(1 - x^2) = (-2 + sqrt(5)) / [ (-1 + sqrt(5))/2 ] = [ (-2 + sqrt(5)) * 2 ] / (-1 + sqrt(5)).\n\nSimplify numerator: (-2 + sqrt(5)) * 2 = -4 + 2sqrt(5).\n\nDenominator: (-1 + sqrt(5)).\n\nSo, we have (-4 + 2sqrt(5)) / (-1 + sqrt(5)).\n\nFactor numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: -4 + 2sqrt(5) = -2*(2 - sqrt(5)).\n\nDenominator: -1 + sqrt(5) = sqrt(5) - 1.\n\nSo, we have (-2*(2 - sqrt(5))) / (sqrt(5) - 1).\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by (sqrt(5) + 1) to rationalize the denominator:\n\nNumerator: (-2*(2 - sqrt(5)))*(sqrt(5) + 1) = -2*[2*sqrt(5) + 2 - 5 - sqrt(5)] = -2*[ (2sqrt(5) - sqrt(5)) + (2 - 5) ] = -2*[ sqrt(5) - 3 ] = -2sqrt(5) + 6.\n\nDenominator: (sqrt(5) - 1)(sqrt(5) + 1) = 5 - 1 = 4.\n\nSo, the expression becomes (-2sqrt(5) + 6)/4 = (6 - 2sqrt(5))/4 = (3 - sqrt(5))/2.\n\nSo, sqrt( (1 - 2x^2)/(1 - x^2) ) = sqrt( (3 - sqrt(5))/2 ) = x, as we had earlier.\n\nTherefore, sin \u03c6 = x, which matches the original equation. So, the solution x = (sqrt(5) - 1)/2 is valid.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's another solution. Because when we squared both sides, sometimes we can introduce extraneous solutions. So, let me check if y = [3 + sqrt(5)]/2 is a possible solution, even though it's greater than 0.5.\n\nWait, y = [3 + sqrt(5)]/2 \u2248 (3 + 2.236)/2 \u2248 5.236/2 \u2248 2.618, which is greater than 1, so x^2 = 2.618 would imply x \u2248 sqrt(2.618) \u2248 1.618, which is greater than 1, which is outside the domain of arcsin, which requires |x| \u2264 1. So, that solution is invalid.\n\nThus, the only valid solution is x = (sqrt(5) - 1)/2.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that when I squared both sides, I didn't lose any solutions. Let me consider the equation:\n\nsqrt( (1 - 2x^2)/(1 - x^2) ) = x\n\nWe squared both sides to get (1 - 2x^2)/(1 - x^2) = x^2, leading to x^4 - 3x^2 + 1 = 0, which we solved correctly.\n\nBut we must ensure that sqrt( (1 - 2x^2)/(1 - x^2) ) is non-negative, which it is, and that x is non-negative, which it is. So, the only solution is x = (sqrt(5) - 1)/2.\n\nTherefore, the number of positive solutions is 1.\n\nWait, but let me just confirm with another approach.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider the function f(x) = sin(arccos(tan(arcsin x))) - x. We can analyze f(x) to see where it crosses zero.\n\nWe know that x must be in (0, 1). Let's check at x = 0: f(0) = sin(arccos(tan(arcsin 0))) - 0 = sin(arccos(tan 0)) = sin(arccos(0)) = sin(\u03c0/2) = 1, so f(0) = 1.\n\nAt x = 1: arcsin(1) = \u03c0/2, tan(\u03c0/2) is undefined, so x approaches 1 from below, f(x) approaches negative infinity? Wait, no, let me think.\n\nWait, as x approaches 1 from below, arcsin x approaches \u03c0/2, so tan(arcsin x) approaches tan(\u03c0/2), which is infinity. Then, arccos(infinity) is undefined, but perhaps we can consider the limit.\n\nWait, as x approaches 1 from below, tan(arcsin x) approaches +infty, so arccos(tan(arcsin x)) approaches arccos(+infty), but arccos is defined only for inputs between -1 and 1. So, as the input to arccos goes beyond 1, it's undefined. So, the function is only defined for x where tan(arcsin x) \u2264 1, because arccos is only defined for arguments between -1 and 1.\n\nWait, that's an important point. So, for arccos(tan(arcsin x)) to be defined, tan(arcsin x) must be in [-1, 1]. But since x is positive, arcsin x is in [0, \u03c0/2], so tan(arcsin x) is non-negative, so we require tan(arcsin x) \u2264 1.\n\nSo, tan(arcsin x) \u2264 1 \u21d2 arcsin x \u2264 arctan(1) = \u03c0/4 \u21d2 x \u2264 sin(\u03c0/4) = sqrt(2)/2 \u2248 0.707.\n\nSo, x must be in (0, sqrt(2)/2].\n\nWait, but earlier, when solving, we found x = (sqrt(5) - 1)/2 \u2248 0.618, which is less than sqrt(2)/2 \u2248 0.707, so that's within the domain.\n\nWait, but if x must be \u2264 sqrt(2)/2, then maybe there's another solution in that interval?\n\nWait, let me check the equation again:\n\nWe had x^4 - 3x^2 + 1 = 0, which gave us two roots for y = x^2: y = [3 \u00b1 sqrt(5)]/2.\n\nWe rejected y = [3 + sqrt(5)]/2 because it's greater than 1, but y = [3 - sqrt(5)]/2 \u2248 0.381966, which is less than (sqrt(2)/2)^2 = 0.5.\n\nWait, so x = sqrt(y) = sqrt([3 - sqrt(5)]/2) \u2248 0.618, which is within (0, sqrt(2)/2).\n\nSo, that's the only solution in that interval. Thus, the number of positive solutions is 1.\n\nWait, but let me check another point, say x = 0.5. Let's compute f(0.5):\n\nCompute arcsin(0.5) = \u03c0/6 \u2248 0.5236 radians.\n\nThen, tan(\u03c0/6) = 1/sqrt(3) \u2248 0.577.\n\nThen, arccos(0.577) \u2248 arccos(0.577) \u2248 0.955 radians.\n\nThen, sin(0.955) \u2248 0.816.\n\nSo, f(0.5) = 0.816 - 0.5 \u2248 0.316 > 0.\n\nAt x = (sqrt(5) - 1)/2 \u2248 0.618, f(x) = 0.\n\nAt x approaching sqrt(2)/2 \u2248 0.707 from below, let's see what happens:\n\nCompute x = 0.7:\n\narcsin(0.7) \u2248 0.7754 radians.\n\ntan(0.7754) \u2248 1.000 (since tan(\u03c0/4) = 1, and 0.7754 is slightly more than \u03c0/4 \u2248 0.7854, so tan(0.7754) \u2248 0.999).\n\nThen, arccos(0.999) \u2248 0.0436 radians.\n\nsin(0.0436) \u2248 0.0436.\n\nSo, f(0.7) \u2248 0.0436 - 0.7 \u2248 -0.6564 < 0.\n\nSo, f(x) goes from positive at x=0.5 to negative at x=0.7, crossing zero at x \u2248 0.618, which is our solution.\n\nTherefore, the function f(x) crosses zero exactly once in (0, sqrt(2)/2), so there's exactly one positive solution.\n\nWait, but let me check another point beyond x \u2248 0.618, say x = 0.7, which we saw f(x) is negative, and at x=0.5, it's positive, so by Intermediate Value Theorem, there's exactly one crossing in (0.5, 0.7). But we found x \u2248 0.618 is the solution, so that's the only positive solution.\n\nTherefore, the number of positive solutions is 1.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of positive solutions is \\boxed{1}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the equation \\(\\sin (\\arccos( \\tan (\\arcsin x) ) ) = x\\), we start by letting \\(\\theta = \\arcsin x\\). This gives us \\(\\theta \\in [0, \\pi/2]\\) and \\(\\sin \\theta = x\\). We then express \\(\\tan \\theta\\) as \\(\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{1 - x^2}}\\).\n\nNext, we let \\(\\phi = \\arccos\\left(\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{1 - x^2}}\\right)\\), which implies \\(\\cos \\phi = \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{1 - x^2}}\\). We then find \\(\\sin \\phi\\) using the identity \\(\\sin^2 \\phi + \\cos^2 \\phi = 1\\):\n\n\\[\n\\sin \\phi = \\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{1 - x^2}}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1 - 2x^2}{1 - x^2}}\n\\]\n\nThe original equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{\\frac{1 - 2x^2}{1 - x^2}} = x\n\\]\n\nSquaring both sides, we get:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1 - 2x^2}{1 - x^2} = x^2\n\\]\n\nMultiplying both sides by \\(1 - x^2\\) and simplifying, we obtain the quartic equation:\n\n\\[\nx^4 - 3x^2 + 1 = 0\n\\]\n\nLetting \\(y = x^2\\), we solve the quadratic equation:\n\n\\[\ny^2 - 3y + 1 = 0\n\\]\n\nUsing the quadratic formula, we find:\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{3 \\pm \\sqrt{5}}{2}\n\\]\n\nSince \\(y = x^2\\) must be non-negative and less than 1, we discard the larger root and keep \\(y = \\frac{3 - \\sqrt{5}}{2}\\). Thus, \\(x = \\sqrt{\\frac{3 - \\sqrt{5}}{2}}\\), which simplifies to \\(x = \\frac{\\sqrt{5} - 1}{2}\\).\n\nWe verify that this solution is valid and lies within the domain \\((0, \\sqrt{2}/2]\\). After checking the behavior of the function and confirming the solution, we conclude that there is exactly one positive solution.\n\nThus, the number of positive solutions is \\(\\boxed{1}\\).",
