Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out what the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{n}{n-1}\\) is for any positive integer \\(n\\). Hmm, binomial coefficients are those things that come from combinations, right? Like, \\(\\dbinom{n}{k}\\) represents the number of ways to choose \\(k\\) elements from a set of \\(n\\) elements without considering the order. So, in this case, we're choosing \\(n-1\\) elements from \\(n\\), which seems pretty straightforward.\n\nLet me recall the formula for binomial coefficients. I think it's \\(\\dbinom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\\). Yeah, that sounds right. So, substituting \\(k = n - 1\\) into the formula, we get:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{n}{n - 1} = \\frac{n!}{(n - 1)! \\cdot (n - (n - 1))!}\n\\]\n\nWait, let me make sure I did that correctly. The denominator should be \\(k!\\) times \\((n - k)!\\), so substituting \\(k = n - 1\\), it becomes \\((n - 1)!\\) times \\((n - (n - 1))!\\). Let me compute \\(n - (n - 1)\\). That's \\(n - n + 1 = 1\\). So, the denominator becomes \\((n - 1)! \\times 1!\\).\n\nNow, let's write that out:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{n}{n - 1} = \\frac{n!}{(n - 1)! \\times 1!}\n\\]\n\nI know that \\(1! = 1\\), so this simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{n!}{(n - 1)!}\n\\]\n\nHmm, what's \\(n!\\) divided by \\((n - 1)!\\)? Let me think. \\(n! = n \\times (n - 1) \\times (n - 2) \\times \\dots \\times 1\\), and \\((n - 1)! = (n - 1) \\times (n - 2) \\times \\dots \\times 1\\). So when I divide \\(n!\\) by \\((n - 1)!\\), the \\((n - 1)!\\) part cancels out, leaving just \\(n\\).\n\nWait, so that means:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{n!}{(n - 1)!} = n\n\\]\n\nTherefore, \\(\\dbinom{n}{n - 1} = n\\).\n\nLet me check this with a small value of \\(n\\) to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's take \\(n = 5\\). Then, \\(\\dbinom{5}{4}\\) should be equal to 5. Let me compute that:\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{5}{4} = \\frac{5!}{4! \\times 1!} = \\frac{120}{24 \\times 1} = \\frac{120}{24} = 5\n\\]\n\nYep, that works. So, when \\(n = 5\\), \\(\\dbinom{5}{4} = 5\\), which is indeed equal to \\(n\\). Let me try another one, maybe \\(n = 3\\).\n\n\\[\n\\dbinom{3}{2} = \\frac{3!}{2! \\times 1!} = \\frac{6}{2 \\times 1} = 3\n\\]\n\nAgain, that works. So, it seems like my reasoning is correct. Therefore, the binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{n}{n - 1}\\) is equal to \\(n\\) for any positive integer \\(n\\).\n</think>\n\nThe binomial coefficient \\(\\dbinom{n}{n-1}\\) can be simplified using the formula for combinations. By substituting \\(k = n - 1\\) into the formula \\(\\dbinom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\\), we find that the expression simplifies to \\(n\\).\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\(\\boxed{n}\\)",
