The gold medal goes to first place, silver to second, and bronze to third.   In how many ways can the medals be awarded if at most one American gets a medal? Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this math problem here about the Olympic 100-meter finals. There are 8 sprinters in total, and out of these, 3 are Americans. The question is asking: In how many ways can the medals be awarded if at most one American gets a medal? The medals are gold, silver, and bronze, which go to first, second, and third places respectively.\n\nAlright, let me break this down. First, I know that when dealing with permutations, the order matters because each medal is a distinct position. So, the total number of ways to award the medals without any restrictions would be the number of permutations of 8 sprinters taken 3 at a time. That would be 8 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 6, right? Because for gold, you have 8 choices, then 7 for silver, and 6 for bronze. Let me calculate that: 8 \u00d7 7 is 56, and 56 \u00d7 6 is 336. So, 336 total ways without any restrictions.\n\nBut the problem says \"at most one American gets a medal.\" Hmm, that means we can't have two or three Americans winning medals. So, we need to exclude the cases where two or three Americans are among the medalists. Alternatively, another approach is to calculate the number of ways where zero Americans get medals and add that to the number of ways where exactly one American gets a medal. That should give me the total number of acceptable arrangements.\n\nLet me try both methods to see if I get the same answer, just to make sure I'm on the right track.\n\nFirst method: Total ways without restrictions minus the ways where two or three Americans get medals.\n\nSo, total ways: 336.\n\nNow, let's find the number of ways where two Americans get medals. To do this, I need to choose 2 Americans out of the 3 and 1 non-American out of the remaining 5 sprinters (since there are 8 total and 3 are Americans, so 5 are non-Americans). But wait, it's not just combinations; we also have to consider the permutations because the order of medals matters.\n\nSo, the number of ways to choose 2 Americans and 1 non-American is: C(3,2) \u00d7 C(5,1), where C(n,k) is the combination formula. C(3,2) is 3, and C(5,1) is 5, so 3 \u00d7 5 = 15. But these are just the combinations. Now, for each of these combinations, we need to assign the medals. Since the medals are distinct, the number of ways to arrange 3 people in 3 positions is 3! = 6. Wait, no, actually, in this case, since we've already selected 2 Americans and 1 non-American, the number of ways to assign the medals is 3! = 6. So, the total number of ways where exactly two Americans get medals is 15 \u00d7 6 = 90.\n\nWait, hold on, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again. When I choose 2 Americans and 1 non-American, the number of ways to arrange them in the three medal positions is indeed 3! because each of the three people can be in any of the three positions. So, 3! = 6. So, 15 combinations \u00d7 6 permutations = 90. So, 90 ways where exactly two Americans get medals.\n\nNow, what about the case where all three medals go to Americans? There are 3 Americans, so we need to arrange all three in the three medal positions. That would be 3! = 6 ways. So, 6 ways where all three Americans get medals.\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways where two or three Americans get medals is 90 + 6 = 96.\n\nSo, the number of ways where at most one American gets a medal is total ways minus these, which is 336 - 96 = 240.\n\nWait, but let me check this another way to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's calculate the number of ways where zero Americans get medals and add that to the number of ways where exactly one American gets a medal.\n\nStarting with zero Americans: All three medals go to non-Americans. There are 5 non-Americans, so the number of ways to arrange 3 medals among them is P(5,3) = 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 = 60.\n\nNow, for exactly one American and two non-Americans: First, choose 1 American out of 3, which is C(3,1) = 3. Then, choose 2 non-Americans out of 5, which is C(5,2) = 10. So, the number of combinations is 3 \u00d7 10 = 30. Now, for each of these combinations, we need to assign the three people to the three medal positions. That's 3! = 6 permutations. So, 30 \u00d7 6 = 180 ways.\n\nTherefore, the total number of acceptable ways is 60 (zero Americans) + 180 (one American) = 240.\n\nHmm, so both methods give me 240, which is reassuring. So, the answer should be 240.\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the first method. Total ways: 336. Subtract the cases where two or three Americans get medals: 90 + 6 = 96. So, 336 - 96 = 240. Yep, same as the second method. So, that's consistent.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the number of ways is 240.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem of determining the number of ways to award the medals such that at most one American receives a medal, we can use two methods: subtracting the unwanted cases from the total or directly calculating the desired cases. Both approaches lead to the same result.\n\n**Method 1: Total Ways Minus Unwanted Cases**\n\n1. **Total Number of Ways Without Restrictions:**\n   \\[\n   P(8,3) = 8 \\times 7 \\times 6 = 336\n   \\]\n\n2. **Number of Ways Where Two Americans Get Medals:**\n   - Choose 2 Americans from 3: \\( C(3,2) = 3 \\)\n   - Choose 1 non-American from 5: \\( C(5,1) = 5 \\)\n   - Arrange the 3 selected sprinters in 3 positions: \\( 3! = 6 \\)\n   - Total ways: \\( 3 \\times 5 \\times 6 = 90 \\)\n\n3. **Number of Ways Where Three Americans Get Medals:**\n   - Arrange 3 Americans in 3 positions: \\( 3! = 6 \\)\n\n4. **Total Unwanted Cases (Two or Three Americans):**\n   \\[\n   90 + 6 = 96\n   \\]\n\n5. **Desired Cases:**\n   \\[\n   336 - 96 = 240\n   \\]\n\n**Method 2: Direct Calculation**\n\n1. **Zero Americans:**\n   - Choose 3 non-Americans from 5: \\( P(5,3) = 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 = 60 \\)\n\n2. **Exactly One American:**\n   - Choose 1 American from 3: \\( C(3,1) = 3 \\)\n   - Choose 2 non-Americans from 5: \\( C(5,2) = 10 \\)\n   - Arrange the 3 selected sprinters: \\( 3! = 6 \\)\n   - Total ways: \\( 3 \\times 10 \\times 6 = 180 \\)\n\n3. **Total Desired Cases:**\n   \\[\n   60 + 180 = 240\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{240}\n\\]",
