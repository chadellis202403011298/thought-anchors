Find the number of ordered triples $(a,b,c)$ of positive integers for which $[a,b] = 1000$, $[b,c] = 2000$, and $[c,a] = 2000$.\n Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this problem here about finding the number of ordered triples (a, b, c) of positive integers where the least common multiples (LCMs) [a, b] = 1000, [b, c] = 2000, and [c, a] = 2000. Hmm, okay, LCMs... I remember that LCM is the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of both numbers. So, for example, [a, b] means the smallest number that both a and b divide into.\n\nFirst, I think it would be helpful to factorize these LCMs into their prime factors because LCMs are closely related to the prime factors of the numbers involved. So, let me start by factorizing 1000 and 2000.\n\n1000 is equal to 10^3, which is (2 * 5)^3, so that's 2^3 * 5^3. Similarly, 2000 is 2^4 * 5^3 because 2000 is 2^4 * 5^3 (since 2000 = 16 * 125, and 16 is 2^4, 125 is 5^3).\n\nSo, [a, b] = 2^3 * 5^3, [b, c] = 2^4 * 5^3, and [c, a] = 2^4 * 5^3. Okay, so now I can think of each number a, b, c in terms of their exponents of primes 2 and 5 because the LCMs only involve these primes. So, any other prime factors in a, b, or c would make the LCMs have those primes as well, but since the LCMs only have 2 and 5, a, b, c must only have 2 and 5 as their prime factors. So, a, b, c are all of the form 2^x * 5^y where x and y are non-negative integers.\n\nSo, to model this, I can represent each number a, b, c as pairs (x, y) where x is the exponent of 2 and y is the exponent of 5. So, for example, a = (x_a, y_a), b = (x_b, y_b), c = (x_c, y_c). Then, the LCM of two numbers, say a and b, would be the maximum of their exponents for each prime. So, [a, b] would be (max(x_a, x_b), max(y_a, y_b)). Similarly for the others.\n\nGiven that, we can break down the problem into two separate problems: one dealing with the exponents of 2, and the other dealing with the exponents of 5. Because the LCMs are determined independently for each prime. So, the total number of ordered triples (a, b, c) would be the product of the number of solutions for the exponents of 2 and the number of solutions for the exponents of 5.\n\nSo, let's first handle the exponents of 2. Let me denote the exponents for 2 in a, b, c as x_a, x_b, x_c respectively. Similarly, for 5, they'll be y_a, y_b, y_c.\n\nGiven that [a, b] = 2^3, so max(x_a, x_b) = 3.\n\nSimilarly, [b, c] = 2^4, so max(x_b, x_c) = 4.\n\nAnd [c, a] = 2^4, so max(x_c, x_a) = 4.\n\nSo, we have these three conditions:\n\n1. max(x_a, x_b) = 3\n2. max(x_b, x_c) = 4\n3. max(x_c, x_a) = 4\n\nSimilarly, for the exponents of 5:\n\nGiven [a, b] = 5^3, so max(y_a, y_b) = 3.\n\n[b, c] = 5^3, so max(y_b, y_c) = 3.\n\n[c, a] = 5^3, so max(y_c, y_a) = 3.\n\nSo, for the exponents of 5, all three LCMs are 5^3, so:\n\n1. max(y_a, y_b) = 3\n2. max(y_b, y_c) = 3\n3. max(y_c, y_a) = 3\n\nSo, now I can handle these two separate systems of equations for exponents of 2 and 5. Let's first tackle the exponents of 2.\n\nFor exponents of 2:\n\nWe have:\n\n1. max(x_a, x_b) = 3\n2. max(x_b, x_c) = 4\n3. max(x_c, x_a) = 4\n\nI need to find the number of ordered triples (x_a, x_b, x_c) where each x is a non-negative integer, satisfying these three conditions.\n\nLet me think about what these conditions imply.\n\nFrom condition 1: max(x_a, x_b) = 3. So, at least one of x_a or x_b is 3, and neither can be greater than 3.\n\nFrom condition 2: max(x_b, x_c) = 4. So, at least one of x_b or x_c is 4, and neither can be greater than 4.\n\nFrom condition 3: max(x_c, x_a) = 4. So, at least one of x_c or x_a is 4, and neither can be greater than 4.\n\nSo, let's try to analyze the possible values of x_a, x_b, x_c.\n\nFirst, from condition 2 and 3, since max(x_b, x_c) = 4 and max(x_c, x_a) = 4, so either x_b or x_c is 4, and either x_c or x_a is 4. So, x_c must be 4, or x_a must be 4, but let's see.\n\nWait, let's suppose that x_c is 4. Then from condition 3, since max(x_c, x_a) = 4, x_a can be anything up to 4, but from condition 1, max(x_a, x_b) = 3, so x_a and x_b can't exceed 3. But wait, if x_c is 4, then from condition 3, max(x_c, x_a) = 4, which is satisfied because x_c is 4. But from condition 1, max(x_a, x_b) = 3, so x_a \u2264 3 and x_b \u2264 3, but then from condition 2, max(x_b, x_c) = max(x_b, 4) = 4, which is okay because x_c is 4. So, in this case, x_c = 4, and x_a \u2264 3, x_b \u2264 3, but from condition 1, at least one of x_a or x_b is 3.\n\nAlternatively, suppose that x_a = 4. Then from condition 3, max(x_c, x_a) = 4, which is satisfied. From condition 1, max(x_a, x_b) = 4, but condition 1 says it's 3. Wait, that's a problem. Because condition 1 says max(x_a, x_b) = 3, but if x_a = 4, then max(x_a, x_b) would be 4, which contradicts condition 1. So, x_a cannot be 4. Therefore, x_c must be 4, because if x_a can't be 4, then to satisfy condition 3, x_c must be 4.\n\nSo, x_c = 4.\n\nNow, from condition 2: max(x_b, x_c) = 4, which is satisfied because x_c = 4.\n\nFrom condition 1: max(x_a, x_b) = 3. So, both x_a and x_b must be \u2264 3, and at least one of them must be 3.\n\nSo, let's model the possible values of x_a and x_b.\n\nx_a can be from 0 to 3, x_b can be from 0 to 3, but at least one of x_a or x_b must be 3.\n\nSo, the number of possible (x_a, x_b) pairs is equal to the total number of pairs where x_a \u2264 3, x_b \u2264 3, minus the number of pairs where both x_a < 3 and x_b < 3.\n\nTotal pairs where x_a \u2264 3 and x_b \u2264 3: 4 choices for x_a (0,1,2,3) and 4 choices for x_b, so 16 total.\n\nNumber of pairs where both x_a < 3 and x_b < 3: x_a can be 0,1,2 and x_b can be 0,1,2, so 3*3=9.\n\nSo, the number of valid (x_a, x_b) pairs is 16 - 9 = 7.\n\nWait, wait, that doesn't seem right. Because if x_a and x_b can be 0,1,2,3, but we require that at least one is 3, then the number of such pairs is (number where x_a=3) + (number where x_b=3) - (number where both x_a=3 and x_b=3).\n\nSo, that's 4 + 4 - 1 = 7, which matches the earlier calculation.\n\nSo, there are 7 possible (x_a, x_b) pairs where max(x_a, x_b)=3.\n\nSince x_c is fixed at 4, each of these 7 possibilities for (x_a, x_b) corresponds to a unique triple (x_a, x_b, x_c) where x_c=4.\n\nTherefore, the number of solutions for exponents of 2 is 7.\n\nWait, but hold on, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. So, x_c is fixed at 4, and for each valid (x_a, x_b) pair, we have a valid triple. So, 7 possibilities.\n\nNow, moving on to exponents of 5.\n\nWe have:\n\n1. max(y_a, y_b) = 3\n2. max(y_b, y_c) = 3\n3. max(y_c, y_a) = 3\n\nSo, all three LCMs are 5^3, so each pair must have at least one element equal to 3, and neither can exceed 3.\n\nSo, let's model this.\n\nEach of y_a, y_b, y_c can be from 0 to 3, but in each pair, at least one must be 3.\n\nSo, let's think about the constraints:\n\nFrom 1: max(y_a, y_b) = 3 \u21d2 at least one of y_a or y_b is 3.\n\nFrom 2: max(y_b, y_c) = 3 \u21d2 at least one of y_b or y_c is 3.\n\nFrom 3: max(y_c, y_a) = 3 \u21d2 at least one of y_c or y_a is 3.\n\nSo, each of the three pairs must have at least one 3.\n\nLet me consider the possible cases for y_a, y_b, y_c.\n\nCase 1: All three are 3. Then all conditions are satisfied.\n\nCase 2: Exactly two are 3. Let's say y_a=3, y_b=3, y_c\u22603. Then, check the conditions:\n\nmax(y_a, y_b)=3: yes.\n\nmax(y_b, y_c)=3: since y_b=3, yes.\n\nmax(y_c, y_a)=3: since y_a=3, yes.\n\nSimilarly, if y_a=3, y_c=3, y_b\u22603, same thing.\n\nOr y_b=3, y_c=3, y_a\u22603: same.\n\nCase 3: Exactly one is 3. Let's say y_a=3, y_b\u22603, y_c\u22603.\n\nThen:\n\nmax(y_a, y_b)=3: yes.\n\nmax(y_b, y_c)= max(y_b, y_c). Since neither is 3, this would be less than 3, which contradicts condition 2. So, this case is impossible.\n\nSimilarly, if y_b=3 and others aren't, then max(y_b, y_c)=3, but max(y_c, y_a) would be max of two numbers less than 3, which is less than 3, violating condition 3. So, same issue.\n\nSame if y_c=3 and others aren't: max(y_c, y_a)=3, but max(y_a, y_b) would be less than 3, violating condition 1.\n\nSo, the only possible cases are where all three are 3, or exactly two are 3.\n\nWait, but let me check: if exactly two are 3, say y_a=3, y_b=3, y_c=2.\n\nThen:\n\nmax(y_a, y_b)=3: yes.\n\nmax(y_b, y_c)=3: yes, since y_b=3.\n\nmax(y_c, y_a)=3: yes, since y_a=3.\n\nSimilarly, if y_a=3, y_c=3, y_b=2: same thing.\n\nSo, all these cases are allowed.\n\nNow, let's count the number of ordered triples (y_a, y_b, y_c) that satisfy all three conditions.\n\nEach y can be from 0 to 3, but with the constraints that in each pair, at least one is 3.\n\nAlternatively, we can model this as each y must be \u22643, and at least one in each pair is 3.\n\nThis is equivalent to saying that no two variables can be less than 3 at the same time. Because if two variables are less than 3, their max would be less than 3, violating the condition.\n\nSo, in other words, for each pair, at least one is 3. So, the complement is that in any pair, both are less than 3, which is forbidden.\n\nSo, the total number of possible triples without any restrictions is 4^3=64.\n\nNow, we need to subtract the triples where at least one pair has both elements less than 3.\n\nBut perhaps a better way is to count directly the number of valid triples.\n\nEach variable y_a, y_b, y_c can be 0,1,2,3, but with the constraints that:\n\n- y_a and y_b cannot both be <3.\n\n- y_b and y_c cannot both be <3.\n\n- y_c and y_a cannot both be <3.\n\nSo, let's think about how many triples satisfy all three constraints.\n\nLet me consider the possible values for y_a, y_b, y_c.\n\nEach can be 0,1,2,3, but with the constraints.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that each variable is either 3 or something less than 3, but ensuring that in each pair, at least one is 3.\n\nSo, perhaps it's easier to consider the possible cases based on how many variables are 3.\n\nCase 1: All three are 3. Then, all conditions are satisfied. There's only 1 such triple: (3,3,3).\n\nCase 2: Exactly two variables are 3. Let's say y_a=3, y_b=3, y_c\u22603. Then, y_c can be 0,1,2. So, 3 possibilities.\n\nSimilarly, y_a=3, y_c=3, y_b\u22603: 3 possibilities.\n\nAnd y_b=3, y_c=3, y_a\u22603: 3 possibilities.\n\nSo, total for Case 2: 3*3=9.\n\nCase 3: Exactly one variable is 3. Let's say y_a=3, y_b\u22603, y_c\u22603. Now, we have to check if this satisfies all the conditions.\n\nFrom condition 1: max(y_a, y_b)=3, which is okay because y_a=3.\n\nCondition 2: max(y_b, y_c)=3. But since both y_b and y_c are <3, their max would be <3, which violates condition 2. So, this case is invalid.\n\nSimilarly, if y_b=3 and others are not, then condition 3 would fail because max(y_c, y_a) would be <3.\n\nSame if y_c=3 and others are not, condition 1 would fail.\n\nSo, Case 3 contributes 0 valid triples.\n\nCase 4: None are 3. Then, all three variables are <3, which would violate all three conditions because each pair would have max <3. So, this is invalid.\n\nSo, total valid triples: Case1 + Case2 = 1 + 9 = 10.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Let me verify.\n\nAlternatively, another way: For each variable, it can be 3 or not, but ensuring that in each pair, at least one is 3.\n\nSo, the number of valid triples is equal to the number of ways where each pair has at least one 3.\n\nThis is similar to the inclusion-exclusion principle.\n\nTotal possible triples without any restriction: 4^3=64.\n\nNow, subtract the triples where at least one pair has both elements <3.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nA: the set of triples where y_a and y_b are both <3.\n\nB: the set where y_b and y_c are both <3.\n\nC: the set where y_c and y_a are both <3.\n\nWe need to compute |A \u222a B \u222a C| and subtract it from 64.\n\nBy inclusion-exclusion:\n\n|A \u222a B \u222a C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A\u2229B| - |A\u2229C| - |B\u2229C| + |A\u2229B\u2229C|.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n|A|: y_a and y_b <3, y_c can be anything. So, y_a and y_b each have 3 choices (0,1,2), y_c has 4 choices. So, |A|=3*3*4=36.\n\nSimilarly, |B|=36, |C|=36.\n\n|A\u2229B|: y_a, y_b, y_c all <3. So, y_a, y_b, y_c each have 3 choices. So, |A\u2229B|=3^3=27.\n\nSimilarly, |A\u2229C|: same as |A\u2229B|, because it's when y_a, y_b, y_c all <3. So, 27.\n\nWait, no. Wait, A is y_a and y_b <3, B is y_b and y_c <3. So, A\u2229B is y_a, y_b, y_c all <3, which is 3^3=27.\n\nSimilarly, A\u2229C would be y_a and y_b <3, and y_c and y_a <3. But if y_a <3, and y_c <3, but y_b <3, then all three are <3, so it's the same as A\u2229B\u2229C.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, A is y_a and y_b <3.\n\nB is y_b and y_c <3.\n\nC is y_c and y_a <3.\n\nSo, A\u2229B is when y_a, y_b, y_c all <3.\n\nSimilarly, A\u2229C is when y_a, y_b <3 and y_c and y_a <3. But since y_a is already <3 from A, this reduces to y_a, y_b, y_c all <3, same as A\u2229B.\n\nSimilarly, B\u2229C is when y_b, y_c <3 and y_c, y_a <3, which again requires y_a, y_b, y_c all <3.\n\nTherefore, |A\u2229B| = |A\u2229C| = |B\u2229C| = 27.\n\nNow, |A\u2229B\u2229C| is also the set where all three are <3, which is 27.\n\nSo, applying inclusion-exclusion:\n\n|A \u222a B \u222a C| = 36 + 36 + 36 - 27 - 27 - 27 + 27.\n\nCompute this:\n\n36*3 = 108\n\nMinus 27*3 = 81\n\nPlus 27.\n\nSo, 108 - 81 = 27; 27 + 27 = 54.\n\nSo, |A \u222a B \u222a C| = 54.\n\nTherefore, the number of valid triples is total triples - |A \u222a B \u222a C| = 64 - 54 = 10.\n\nWhich matches the earlier count. So, 10 valid triples for exponents of 5.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\n- For exponents of 2: 7 solutions.\n\n- For exponents of 5: 10 solutions.\n\nSince the exponents of 2 and 5 are independent, the total number of ordered triples (a, b, c) is 7 * 10 = 70.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the final answer is 70.\n\nBut let me just double-check the exponents of 2 part because earlier I thought there were 7 solutions, but let me go through it again.\n\nWe have x_c = 4, fixed.\n\nThen, for (x_a, x_b), we need max(x_a, x_b) = 3, so x_a and x_b can be 0-3, but at least one is 3.\n\nNumber of such pairs: total pairs where x_a and x_b \u22643 is 4*4=16.\n\nNumber of pairs where both <3 is 3*3=9.\n\nSo, 16-9=7, correct.\n\nSo, 7 possibilities for exponents of 2, 10 for exponents of 5, total 70.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of ordered triples is \\boxed{70}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by factorizing the given LCMs into their prime factors. We have:\n\n- \\([a, b] = 1000 = 2^3 \\times 5^3\\)\n- \\([b, c] = 2000 = 2^4 \\times 5^3\\)\n- \\([c, a] = 2000 = 2^4 \\times 5^3\\)\n\nWe represent each number \\(a, b, c\\) as pairs \\((x, y)\\) where \\(x\\) is the exponent of 2 and \\(y\\) is the exponent of 5.
