What is the smallest $n$ for which the $n$th term of the sequence is divisible by one million? Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this problem here about a geometric sequence. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The problem says the first term is 3/4, and the second term is 15. I need to find the smallest n for which the nth term is divisible by one million. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I remember that a geometric sequence has each term after the first found by multiplying the previous term by a constant called the common ratio, usually denoted as r. So, if the first term is a1, then the second term is a1 * r, the third term is a1 * r^2, and so on. So, in general, the nth term is a1 * r^(n-1).\n\nGiven that the first term a1 is 3/4, and the second term is 15, I can use these two to find the common ratio r. Since the second term is a1 * r, I can set up the equation:\n\n15 = (3/4) * r\n\nTo solve for r, I'll divide both sides by (3/4), which is the same as multiplying by 4/3. So,\n\nr = 15 * (4/3) = 20\n\nWait, that seems a bit big, but let me check. 3/4 times 20 is indeed 15, because 3/4 * 20 = 15. Yep, that's correct. So, the common ratio r is 20.\n\nNow, the nth term of the sequence is given by a_n = a1 * r^(n-1). Plugging in the values we have:\n\na_n = (3/4) * 20^(n-1)\n\nI need to find the smallest n such that a_n is divisible by one million. So, 1,000,000 divides a_n, which means a_n must be a multiple of 1,000,000. In other words, a_n / 1,000,000 should be an integer.\n\nSo, let's write that condition mathematically:\n\n(3/4) * 20^(n-1) / 1,000,000 must be an integer.\n\nSimplifying this, we can write:\n\n(3/4) * 20^(n-1) = 1,000,000 * k, where k is an integer.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to think about the expression (3/4) * 20^(n-1) being a multiple of 1,000,000. Let me rewrite 1,000,000 as 10^6 to make it clearer.\n\nSo, (3/4) * 20^(n-1) must be divisible by 10^6. Let's express everything in terms of prime factors to see what's going on.\n\nFirst, 3/4 is 3/(2^2). Then, 20 is 2^2 * 5, so 20^(n-1) is (2^2 * 5)^(n-1) = 2^(2(n-1)) * 5^(n-1).\n\nSo, putting it all together, a_n is:\n\n(3/(2^2)) * (2^(2(n-1)) * 5^(n-1)) = 3 * 2^(2(n-1) - 2) * 5^(n-1)\n\nSimplifying the exponents:\n\n2^(2(n-1) - 2) = 2^(2n - 2 - 2) = 2^(2n - 4)\n\nSo, a_n = 3 * 2^(2n - 4) * 5^(n - 1)\n\nWe need this to be divisible by 10^6, which is (2*5)^6 = 2^6 * 5^6.\n\nSo, for a_n to be divisible by 2^6 * 5^6, the exponents of 2 and 5 in a_n must be at least 6.\n\nLooking at a_n's prime factors:\n\n- The exponent of 2 is (2n - 4)\n- The exponent of 5 is (n - 1)\n- The exponent of 3 is 1, which isn't a problem because 10^6 doesn't have any 3s.\n\nSo, we need:\n\n2n - 4 \u2265 6 and n - 1 \u2265 6\n\nLet me solve these inequalities separately.\n\nFirst inequality: 2n - 4 \u2265 6\n\nAdding 4 to both sides: 2n \u2265 10\n\nDividing by 2: n \u2265 5\n\nSecond inequality: n - 1 \u2265 6\n\nAdding 1 to both sides: n \u2265 7\n\nSo, n has to satisfy both inequalities. The first one says n is at least 5, the second says n is at least 7. So, the stricter condition is n \u2265 7.\n\nWait, but let me check if n=7 actually works, because sometimes when dealing with exponents, especially when combining terms, you might need a higher n. Let me compute a_7 and see if it's divisible by 1,000,000.\n\nBut before that, maybe I can check the exponents for n=7:\n\nFor 2's exponent: 2n - 4 = 2*7 - 4 = 14 - 4 = 10. So, 2^10.\n\nFor 5's exponent: 7 - 1 = 6. So, 5^6.\n\nSo, a_7 = 3 * 2^10 * 5^6.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n2^10 is 1024, 5^6 is 15,625. Multiplying 1024 * 15,625:\n\n1024 * 15,625. Let me compute that step by step.\n\n15,625 * 1000 = 15,625,000\n\n15,625 * 24 = Let's compute 15,625 * 20 = 312,500 and 15,625 * 4 = 62,500. So, total is 312,500 + 62,500 = 375,000.\n\nSo, 15,625 * 1024 = 15,625 * (1000 + 24) = 15,625,000 + 375,000 = 16,000,000.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right. Wait, 15,625 * 1024: Let me think differently. 15,625 is 5^6, which is 15,625, and 1024 is 2^10. So, 15,625 * 1024 = (5^6) * (2^10) = 10^6 * 2^(10-6) * 5^(6-6) = 10^6 * 2^4 * 5^0 = 10^6 * 16 * 1 = 16,000,000.\n\nWait, that seems correct because 10^6 is 1,000,000, and 16 times that is 16,000,000. So, a_7 = 3 * 16,000,000 = 48,000,000.\n\nSo, 48,000,000 is indeed divisible by 1,000,000 because 48,000,000 \u00f7 1,000,000 = 48, which is an integer. So, n=7 works.\n\nWait, but let me check if n=6 works as well, just to be sure that 7 is indeed the smallest.\n\nFor n=6:\n\na_6 = 3 * 2^(2*6 -4) * 5^(6-1) = 3 * 2^(12-4) * 5^5 = 3 * 2^8 * 5^5.\n\nCompute 2^8 = 256, 5^5 = 3125.\n\nSo, 256 * 3125: Let's compute that.\n\n3125 * 200 = 625,000\n\n3125 * 56 = Let's compute 3125 * 50 = 156,250 and 3125 * 6 = 18,750. So, 156,250 + 18,750 = 175,000.\n\nSo, total is 625,000 + 175,000 = 800,000.\n\nSo, 256 * 3125 = 800,000.\n\nThen, a_6 = 3 * 800,000 = 2,400,000.\n\nNow, 2,400,000 divided by 1,000,000 is 2.4, which is not an integer. So, a_6 is 2,400,000, which is not divisible by 1,000,000 because it leaves a remainder of 400,000. So, n=6 doesn't work.\n\nWait, but that seems contradictory because according to the inequalities earlier, n=7 is the first n that satisfies both conditions. So, maybe I made a mistake in my initial approach.\n\nWait, let me go back. The exponents required for 10^6 are 2^6 and 5^6. So, in a_n, we have 2^(2n - 4) and 5^(n -1). So, for a_n to be divisible by 2^6 and 5^6, both exponents must be at least 6.\n\nSo, 2n - 4 \u2265 6 \u21d2 n \u2265 5\n\nAnd n - 1 \u2265 6 \u21d2 n \u2265 7\n\nSo, n must be at least 7, which is correct because n=7 is the smallest integer that satisfies both conditions. So, n=7 is the answer.\n\nWait, but let me check if I did the prime factorization correctly. So, a_n = (3/4) * 20^(n-1) = 3/(2^2) * (2^2 * 5)^(n-1) = 3 * 2^(2(n-1)) * 5^(n-1) / 2^2 = 3 * 2^(2n - 2 - 2) * 5^(n-1) = 3 * 2^(2n -4) * 5^(n-1). Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, to have 2^(2n -4) \u2265 2^6 and 5^(n -1) \u2265 5^6, which gives 2n -4 \u2265 6 \u21d2 n \u2265 5, and n -1 \u2265 6 \u21d2 n \u2265 7.\n\nThus, the minimal n is 7.\n\nWait, but when I computed a_7, I got 48,000,000, which is 48 * 1,000,000, so it's indeed divisible. And a_6 was 2,400,000, which is 2.4 * 1,000,000, not an integer multiple. So, that's correct.\n\nWait, but maybe I should consider that the term a_n must be an integer. Because if a_n is not an integer, it can't be divisible by one million, which is an integer. So, let's check if a_n is an integer for n=7.\n\nFrom the expression a_n = 3 * 2^(2n -4) * 5^(n-1). For n=7, that's 3 * 2^(10) * 5^(6). 2^10 is 1024, 5^6 is 15,625, and 3 times that is 48,000,000, which is an integer. So, that's fine.\n\nBut wait, for n=5, let's see:\n\na_5 = 3 * 2^(2*5 -4) *5^(5-1) = 3 * 2^(10 -4) *5^4 = 3 * 2^6 * 5^4.\n\n2^6 is 64, 5^4 is 625. So, 64 * 625 = 40,000. Then, 3 * 40,000 = 120,000. 120,000 is 120 * 1,000, which is 120,000, but 120,000 divided by 1,000,000 is 0.12, which is not an integer. So, n=5 doesn't work.\n\nSimilarly, n=6 gives 2,400,000, which is 2.4 * 1,000,000, not integer.\n\nn=7 gives 48,000,000, which is 48 * 1,000,000, which is an integer multiple.\n\nSo, the minimal n is 7.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I can approach this differently. Let's express a_n as (3/4) * 20^(n-1). We can write 20 as 4*5, so 20^(n-1) = 4^(n-1) * 5^(n-1). So, a_n = (3/4) * 4^(n-1) * 5^(n-1) = 3 * 4^(n-2) * 5^(n-1).\n\nBecause 4^(n-1) divided by 4 is 4^(n-2).\n\nSo, a_n = 3 * 4^(n-2) * 5^(n-1).\n\nWe can write this as 3 * (2^2)^(n-2) * 5^(n-1) = 3 * 2^(2n -4) *5^(n-1), which is the same as before.\n\nWe need a_n to be divisible by 1,000,000 = 2^6 *5^6.\n\nSo, the exponents of 2 and 5 in a_n must be at least 6.\n\nSo, for 2's exponent: 2n -4 \u22656 \u21d22n \u226510 \u21d2n\u22655\n\nFor 5's exponent: n -1 \u22656 \u21d2n\u22657\n\nThus, n must be at least 7.\n\nSo, the minimal n is 7.\n\nWait, but let me check if I can write a_n as 3 * 20^(n-1)/4. So, a_n = (3/4)*20^(n-1). Let's see if this can be written as 3*(5*4)^(n-1)/4 = 3*5^(n-1)*4^(n-1)/4 = 3*5^(n-1)*4^(n-2).\n\nWhich is the same as before, so 3*4^(n-2)*5^(n-1).\n\nSo, for a_n to be an integer, 4^(n-2) must be an integer, which it is for n\u22652. But more importantly, when we multiply by 3, we need the entire term to be an integer, which it is for n\u22652, but when we divide by 4, it's already handled by the 4^(n-2).\n\nBut the main point is that for a_n to be divisible by 1,000,000, the exponents of 2 and 5 in its prime factorization must be at least 6 each.\n\nSo, as before, 2n -4 \u22656 \u21d2n\u22655\n\nn -1 \u22656 \u21d2n\u22657\n\nThus, n=7 is the minimal n.\n\nWait, but let me think about whether 3 affects this. Since 3 is a prime factor not present in 1,000,000, it doesn't impose any additional constraints beyond what's already required. So, the presence of 3 just means that a_n will have an extra factor of 3, but since 1,000,000 doesn't require any 3s, it's fine.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\na_n = 3 * 2^(2n -4) *5^(n -1)\n\nWe need 2^(2n -4) to be at least 2^6, so 2n -4 \u22656 \u21d2n\u22655\n\nAnd 5^(n -1) to be at least 5^6 \u21d2n -1\u22656 \u21d2n\u22657\n\nSo, n must be at least 7.\n\nThus, the smallest n is 7.\n\nI think that makes sense. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, and checking n=7 gives a_n=48,000,000, which is indeed divisible by 1,000,000. So, the answer should be 7.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe smallest \\( n \\) is \\boxed{7}.\n</think>\n\nGiven the first term of a geometric sequence \\( a_1 = \\frac{3}{4} \\) and the second term \\( a_2 = 15 \\), we need to find the smallest \\( n \\) for which the \\( n \\)-th term is divisible by one million.\n\n1. **Find the common ratio \\( r \\):**\n   \\[\n   a_2 = a_1 \\cdot r \\implies 15 = \\frac{3}{4} \\cdot r \\implies r = 15 \\cdot \\frac{4}{3} = 20\n   \\]\n\n2. **General form of the \\( n \\)-th term:**\n   \\[\n   a_n = a_1 \\cdot r^{n-1} = \\frac{3}{4} \\cdot 20^{n-1}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Express \\( a_n \\) in terms of prime factors:**\n   \\[\n   a_n = \\frac{3}{4} \\cdot (2^2 \\cdot 5)^{n-1} = 3 \\cdot 2^{2(n-1)} \\cdot 5^{n-1} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2^2} = 3 \\cdot 2^{2n-4} \\cdot 5^{n-1}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Condition for divisibility by one million (\\( 10^6 = 2^6 \\cdot 5^6 \\)):**\n   - The exponent of 2 in \\( a_n \\) must be at least 6:\n     \\[\n     2n - 4 \\geq 6 \\implies 2n \\geq 10 \\implies n \\geq 5\n     \\]\n   - The exponent of 5 in \\( a_n \\) must be at least 6:\n     \\[\n     n - 1 \\geq 6 \\implies n \\geq 7\n     \\]\n\n5. **Determine the smallest \\( n \\) satisfying both conditions:**\n   - The stricter condition is \\( n \\geq 7 \\).\n\n6. **Verification:**\n   - For \\( n = 7 \\):\n     \\[\n     a_7 = 3 \\cdot 2^{10} \\cdot 5^6 = 3 \\cdot 1024 \\cdot 15625 = 48,000,000\n     \\]\n     - 48,000,000 is divisible by 1,000,000.\n\nThus, the smallest \\( n \\) for which the \\( n \\)-th term is divisible by one million is \\(\\boxed{7}\\).",
