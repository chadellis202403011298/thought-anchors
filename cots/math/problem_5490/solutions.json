Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how many distinct positive factors the number 32 has. Hmm, I remember that factors are numbers that divide into another number without leaving a remainder. So, for example, factors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6 because each of those divides evenly into 6.\n\nBut I'm not exactly sure how to approach this for 32. Maybe I can start by listing all the numbers that divide into 32. Let me try that. So, starting from 1, since 1 is a factor of every number. Then, 2 because 32 divided by 2 is 16, which is an integer. Next, 3? Wait, 32 divided by 3 is about 10.666, which isn't an integer, so 3 isn't a factor. How about 4? 32 divided by 4 is 8, so 4 is a factor. Then 5? 32 divided by 5 is 6.4, which isn't an integer, so 5 isn't a factor. Next is 6, but 32 divided by 6 is approximately 5.333, so that's not an integer either. 7? 32 divided by 7 is around 4.571, which isn't an integer. 8? 32 divided by 8 is 4, so 8 is a factor. \n\nWait, but I just went up to 8, and 8 times 4 is 32. But I think I might be missing some factors beyond that. Let me check. After 8, the next number is 16. 32 divided by 16 is 2, so 16 is a factor. Then, 32 divided by 32 is 1, so 32 is also a factor. \n\nSo, listing them out, I have 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32. That seems like six factors in total. But I'm not sure if I missed any. Maybe I should try a different approach, like prime factorization, to make sure I didn't miss any factors.\n\nPrime factorization involves breaking down a number into its prime number components. Let's try that with 32. I know that 32 is an even number, so it's divisible by 2. Let's divide 32 by 2: 32 \u00f7 2 = 16. 16 is also even, so divide by 2 again: 16 \u00f7 2 = 8. 8 is even too, so divide by 2: 8 \u00f7 2 = 4. 4 divided by 2 is 2, and then 2 divided by 2 is 1. So, the prime factors of 32 are 2 multiplied by itself five times, which can be written as 2^5.\n\nNow, I remember that the number of distinct positive factors of a number can be found by taking the exponents in its prime factorization, adding one to each of those exponents, and then multiplying them together. So, if a number N has a prime factorization of the form p1^a * p2^b * p3^c..., then the number of factors is (a+1)(b+1)(c+1)... etc.\n\nIn the case of 32, its prime factorization is 2^5. So, the exponent here is 5. Applying the formula, I add 1 to the exponent: 5 + 1 = 6. So, the number of distinct positive factors is 6.\n\nWait, that matches the count I got earlier when I listed them out: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32. So, that seems correct. But just to be thorough, let me make sure I didn't miss any factors when I was listing them. \n\nStarting from 1 and going up to 32, checking each number:\n\n1: Yes, divides 32.\n2: Yes, as 32 \u00f7 2 = 16.\n3: No, as 32 \u00f7 3 isn't an integer.\n4: Yes, 32 \u00f7 4 = 8.\n5: No, as before.\n6: No, as before.\n7: No, as before.\n8: Yes, 32 \u00f7 8 = 4.\n9: 32 \u00f7 9 \u2248 3.555, so no.\n10: 32 \u00f7 10 = 3.2, so no.\n11: 32 \u00f7 11 \u2248 2.909, no.\n12: 32 \u00f7 12 \u2248 2.666, no.\n13: 32 \u00f7 13 \u2248 2.461, no.\n14: 32 \u00f7 14 \u2248 2.285, no.\n15: 32 \u00f7 15 \u2248 2.133, no.\n16: Yes, 32 \u00f7 16 = 2.\n17: 32 \u00f7 17 \u2248 1.882, no.\n18: 32 \u00f7 18 \u2248 1.777, no.\n19: 32 \u00f7 19 \u2248 1.684, no.\n20: 32 \u00f7 20 = 1.6, no.\n21: 32 \u00f7 21 \u2248 1.523, no.\n22: 32 \u00f7 22 \u2248 1.454, no.\n23: 32 \u00f7 23 \u2248 1.391, no.\n24: 32 \u00f7 24 \u2248 1.333, no.\n25: 32 \u00f7 25 = 1.28, no.\n26: 32 \u00f7 26 \u2248 1.230, no.\n27: 32 \u00f7 27 \u2248 1.185, no.\n28: 32 \u00f7 28 \u2248 1.142, no.\n29: 32 \u00f7 29 \u2248 1.103, no.\n30: 32 \u00f7 30 \u2248 1.066, no.\n31: 32 \u00f7 31 \u2248 1.032, no.\n32: Yes, 32 \u00f7 32 = 1.\n\nSo, indeed, the only factors are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32. That's six factors in total. \n\nI think I'm confident now that 32 has six distinct positive factors. Both the listing method and the prime factorization method gave me the same answer, so that should be correct.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many distinct positive factors 32 has, we can use prime factorization and the formula for the number of factors.\n\n1. **Prime Factorization**:  \n   - 32 is divisible by 2: 32 \u00f7 2 = 16  \n   - 16 \u00f7 2 = 8  \n   - 8 \u00f7 2 = 4  \n   - 4 \u00f7 2 = 2  \n   - 2 \u00f7 2 = 1  \n   - Thus, 32 = 2^5.\n\n2. **Number of Factors Formula**:  \n   - If a number N = p^a, where p is a prime, the number of distinct positive factors is (a + 1).  \n   - Here, a = 5, so the number of factors is (5 + 1) = 6.\n\n3. **Verification by Listing**:  \n   - Factors of 32: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32.  \n   - Total of 6 factors.\n\n**Answer**:  \n\\boxed{6}",
