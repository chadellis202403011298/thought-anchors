  "problem": "An infinite geometric series has first term $328$ and a sum of $2009$. What is its common ratio?",
  "level": "Level 5",
  "type": "Algebra",
  "gt_solution": "Since this is an infinite geometric series, we have $\\frac{328}{1-r} = 2009$. Solving for $r$, we find that $r = \\boxed{\\frac{41}{49}}$.",
  "gt_answer": "\\frac{41}{49}"
