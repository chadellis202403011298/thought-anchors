Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this problem here about an infinite geometric series. The first term is 328, and the sum is 2009. I need to find the common ratio. Hmm, I remember that geometric series have a specific formula for their sum, especially when they're infinite. Let me try to recall that.\n\nAlright, I think the formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series is S = a\u2081 / (1 - r), where S is the sum, a\u2081 is the first term, and r is the common ratio. Yeah, that sounds right. I should double-check that. So, if that's the case, then I can plug in the values I have into this formula and solve for r.\n\nGiven that the first term a\u2081 is 328 and the sum S is 2009, I can write the equation as 2009 = 328 / (1 - r). Now, I need to solve for r. Let me write that down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll write the equation:\n\n2009 = 328 / (1 - r)\n\nI want to solve for r, so I'll start by getting rid of the denominator. I can multiply both sides of the equation by (1 - r) to do that. Let's see:\n\n2009 * (1 - r) = 328\n\nExpanding the left side, I get:\n\n2009 - 2009r = 328\n\nNow, I'll subtract 2009 from both sides to isolate the term with r:\n\n-2009r = 328 - 2009\n\nCalculating 328 minus 2009, let's see. 2009 minus 328 is 1681, so 328 - 2009 would be -1681. So,\n\n-2009r = -1681\n\nNow, I can divide both sides by -2009 to solve for r:\n\nr = (-1681) / (-2009)\n\nDividing two negative numbers gives a positive result, so:\n\nr = 1681 / 2009\n\nHmm, let me see if I can simplify this fraction. Both numerator and denominator are numbers, so maybe they have a common factor. Let me check if 1681 and 2009 share any common divisors.\n\nI know that 1681 is 41 squared because 40 squared is 1600, and 41 squared is 1681. So, 1681 = 41\u00b2. What about 2009? Let me try dividing 2009 by 41 to see if it's a factor.\n\n2009 \u00f7 41. Let me do the division. 41 times 40 is 1640, subtract that from 2009: 2009 - 1640 = 369. Now, 41 times 9 is 369, so 41 times 49 is 2009. So, 2009 = 41 * 49.\n\nTherefore, 1681 / 2009 = (41\u00b2) / (41 * 49) = 41 / 49. Because one 41 cancels out from numerator and denominator.\n\nSo, r = 41/49.\n\nWait, let me confirm that. If I simplify 1681/2009 by dividing numerator and denominator by 41, I get 41/49. Yes, that's correct.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations, let me go through the steps again.\n\n1. The formula: S = a\u2081 / (1 - r)\n2. Plug in S = 2009 and a\u2081 = 328: 2009 = 328 / (1 - r)\n3. Multiply both sides by (1 - r): 2009*(1 - r) = 328\n4. Expand: 2009 - 2009r = 328\n5. Subtract 2009 from both sides: -2009r = 328 - 2009 = -1681\n6. Divide both sides by -2009: r = (-1681)/(-2009) = 1681/2009\n7. Simplify: 1681 = 41\u00b2, 2009 = 41*49, so 41\u00b2/(41*49) = 41/49\n\nYep, that all checks out. So the common ratio is 41/49.\n\nI should also remember that for an infinite geometric series to converge, the absolute value of the common ratio must be less than 1. In this case, 41/49 is approximately 0.8367, which is less than 1, so it's valid.\n\nJust to double-check, let me compute the sum using r = 41/49 and see if it equals 2009.\n\nCompute a\u2081 / (1 - r) = 328 / (1 - 41/49) = 328 / (8/49) = 328 * (49/8)\n\nLet me compute that. 328 \u00f7 8 = 41, because 8*40 = 320, and 8*1 = 8, so 40 + 1 = 41. Then, 41 * 49.\n\nCompute 41 * 49. 40*49 = 1960, and 1*49 = 49, so 1960 + 49 = 2009. Perfect, that's the sum given in the problem. So that confirms that r = 41/49 is correct.\n\nI think I've got it right. So the common ratio is 41/49.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe common ratio is \\boxed{\\dfrac{41}{49}}.\n</think>\n\nGiven an infinite geometric series with the first term \\( a_1 = 328 \\) and the sum \\( S = 2009 \\), we need to find the common ratio \\( r \\).\n\nThe formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series is:\n\\[ S = \\frac{a_1}{1 - r} \\]\n\nPlugging in the given values:\n\\[ 2009 = \\frac{328}{1 - r} \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( r \\), we first multiply both sides by \\( 1 - r \\):\n\\[ 2009(1 - r) = 328 \\]\n\nExpanding and simplifying:\n\\[ 2009 - 2009r = 328 \\]\n\\[ -2009r = 328 - 2009 \\]\n\\[ -2009r = -1681 \\]\n\nDividing both sides by -2009:\n\\[ r = \\frac{-1681}{-2009} \\]\n\\[ r = \\frac{1681}{2009} \\]\n\nSimplifying the fraction by noting that \\( 1681 = 41^2 \\) and \\( 2009 = 41 \\times 49 \\):\n\\[ r = \\frac{41^2}{41 \\times 49} = \\frac{41}{49} \\]\n\nThus, the common ratio is:\n\\[ \\boxed{\\dfrac{41}{49}} \\]",
