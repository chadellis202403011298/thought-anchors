Problem: If $p, q,$ and $r$ are three non-zero integers such that $p + q + r = 26$ and\\[\\frac{1}{p} + \\frac{1}{q} + \\frac{1}{r} + \\frac{360}{pqr} = 1,\\] compute $pqr$.\n Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to find the value of \\( pqr \\) where \\( p, q, \\) and \\( r \\) are three non-zero integers. The problem gives me two conditions: the sum of \\( p, q, \\) and \\( r \\) is 26, and another equation involving their reciprocals and a term with \\( \\frac{360}{pqr} \\) that equals 1. Let me write down the given information to get a clearer picture.\n\nFirst, the equations are:\n\n1. \\( p + q + r = 26 \\)\n2. \\( \\frac{1}{p} + \\frac{1}{q} + \\frac{1}{r} + \\frac{360}{pqr} = 1 \\)\n\nI need to find \\( pqr \\). Hmm, okay. Let's see how I can approach this.\n\nI remember that when dealing with equations involving reciprocals, it's often helpful to combine the fractions. Maybe I can combine all the terms on the left side of the second equation to have a single fraction. Let me try that.\n\nSo, the second equation is:\n\n\\( \\frac{1}{p} + \\frac{1}{q} + \\frac{1}{r} + \\frac{360}{pqr} = 1 \\)\n\nTo combine these, I can find a common denominator, which would be \\( pqr \\). Let's rewrite each term with this denominator.\n\n- \\( \\frac{1}{p} = \\frac{qr}{pqr} \\)\n- \\( \\frac{1}{q} = \\frac{pr}{pqr} \\)\n- \\( \\frac{1}{r} = \\frac{pq}{pqr} \\)\n- \\( \\frac{360}{pqr} \\) is already with the denominator \\( pqr \\).\n\nSo, combining all these, the equation becomes:\n\n\\( \\frac{qr + pr + pq + 360}{pqr} = 1 \\)\n\nNow, since the left side is a single fraction equal to 1, the numerator must be equal to the denominator. Therefore:\n\n\\( qr + pr + pq + 360 = pqr \\)\n\nHmm, that's interesting. So, \\( pqr - pq - pr - qr = 360 \\). Let me write that as:\n\n\\( pqr - pq - pr - qr = 360 \\)\n\nI wonder if I can factor this equation somehow. Let me see. Maybe I can factor by grouping or look for a way to express this in terms of the sum \\( p + q + r \\).\n\nWait, I also know that \\( p + q + r = 26 \\). Maybe I can use this somehow. Let me think about how these two equations can be connected.\n\nLet me try to express \\( pqr \\) in terms of \\( pq, pr, qr \\) and the sum \\( p + q + r \\). Hmm, perhaps I can use the identity for expanding \\( (p - 1)(q - 1)(r - 1) \\) or something similar, but I'm not sure if that would help here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the equation \\( pqr - pq - pr - qr = 360 \\) and try to factor it. Let me see:\n\n\\( pqr - pq - pr - qr = 360 \\)\n\nI can factor out terms:\n\n\\( pq(r - 1) - pr - qr = 360 \\)\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps. Let me try another approach.\n\nLet me consider that \\( p, q, r \\) are integers, and their product \\( pqr \\) is involved, so perhaps they are factors of 360 or something related. Let me see.\n\nWait, the equation \\( pqr - pq - pr - qr = 360 \\) can be rewritten as:\n\n\\( pqr - pq - pr - qr + 1 = 361 \\)\n\nWait, why? Because I added 1 to both sides. Let me check:\n\n\\( pqr - pq - pr - qr + 1 = 360 + 1 = 361 \\)\n\nNow, I notice that the left side can be factored as:\n\n\\( (p - 1)(q - 1)(r - 1) \\)\n\nLet me verify that:\n\n\\( (p - 1)(q - 1)(r - 1) = pqr - pq - pr - qr + p + q + r - 1 \\)\n\nWait, that's not exactly the same as what I have. Let me compute it step by step.\n\nFirst, expand \\( (p - 1)(q - 1) \\):\n\n\\( (p - 1)(q - 1) = pq - p - q + 1 \\)\n\nNow, multiply this by \\( (r - 1) \\):\n\n\\( (pq - p - q + 1)(r - 1) = pq \\cdot r - pq \\cdot 1 - p \\cdot r + p \\cdot 1 - q \\cdot r + q \\cdot 1 + 1 \\cdot r - 1 \\cdot 1 \\)\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\n- \\( pq \\cdot r = pqr \\)\n- \\( -pq \\cdot 1 = -pq \\)\n- \\( -p \\cdot r = -pr \\)\n- \\( +p \\cdot 1 = +p \\)\n- \\( -q \\cdot r = -qr \\)\n- \\( +q \\cdot 1 = +q \\)\n- \\( +1 \\cdot r = +r \\)\n- \\( -1 \\cdot 1 = -1 \\)\n\nCombine all these terms:\n\n\\( pqr - pq - pr - qr + p + q + r - 1 \\)\n\nSo, \\( (p - 1)(q - 1)(r - 1) = pqr - pq - pr - qr + p + q + r - 1 \\)\n\nBut in my earlier equation, I have \\( pqr - pq - pr - qr + 1 = 361 \\). Comparing this with the expanded form of \\( (p - 1)(q - 1)(r - 1) \\), which is \\( pqr - pq - pr - qr + p + q + r - 1 \\), I can see that:\n\n\\( (p - 1)(q - 1)(r - 1) = (pqr - pq - pr - qr) + (p + q + r) - 1 \\)\n\nFrom my equation, \\( pqr - pq - pr - qr = 360 \\), so substituting that in:\n\n\\( (p - 1)(q - 1)(r - 1) = 360 + (p + q + r) - 1 \\)\n\nBut I know \\( p + q + r = 26 \\), so:\n\n\\( (p - 1)(q - 1)(r - 1) = 360 + 26 - 1 = 385 \\)\n\nSo, \\( (p - 1)(q - 1)(r - 1) = 385 \\)\n\nHmm, that's a useful equation because 385 is a known number, and I can factor it to find possible integer values for \\( p - 1, q - 1, r - 1 \\). Let me factor 385.\n\n385 divided by 5 is 77, because 5 times 77 is 385. Then, 77 can be factored into 7 and 11. So, 385 factors into 5 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 11. Therefore, 385 is the product of these three primes.\n\nSo, \\( (p - 1)(q - 1)(r - 1) = 5 \\times 7 \\times 11 = 385 \\)\n\nNow, since \\( p, q, r \\) are integers, \\( p - 1, q - 1, r - 1 \\) must be positive integers because \\( p, q, r \\) are non-zero, and if they were 1, then \\( p - 1 \\) would be 0, but 0 can't be a factor here because 385 is positive. So, \\( p, q, r \\) must each be greater than 1, making \\( p - 1, q - 1, r - 1 \\) positive integers.\n\nSo, the possible values for \\( p - 1, q - 1, r - 1 \\) are the factors of 385. Since 385 factors into 5, 7, and 11, which are all primes, the possible triplets (in any order) for \\( (p - 1, q - 1, r - 1) \\) are (5, 7, 11). There might be other factorizations if we consider 1 as a factor, but since 385 is 5\u00d77\u00d711, and all are primes, the only way to write it as a product of three positive integers is 1\u00d75\u00d777, 1\u00d77\u00d755, 1\u00d711\u00d735, 5\u00d77\u00d711, etc. But since we need three positive integers greater than zero, and \\( p, q, r \\) are non-zero, let's see.\n\nWait, actually, \\( p - 1, q - 1, r - 1 \\) could be 1, 5, 77 or 1, 7, 55, etc. But since \\( p, q, r \\) are non-zero integers, \\( p - 1, q - 1, r - 1 \\) could be 1, but if any of them is 1, then \\( p, q, r \\) would be 2, which is allowed.\n\nBut let's check which triplet of factors of 385 adds up correctly when 1 is added back to each to get \\( p, q, r \\) such that their sum is 26.\n\nWait, let's first consider the triplet (5,7,11). Then, \\( p, q, r \\) would be 6, 8, 12. Let's check the sum: 6 + 8 + 12 = 26. Perfect, that's exactly the sum we need. So that seems to fit.\n\nBut let me make sure there aren't other possible triplets. Let's check other possible factorizations.\n\nAnother possible triplet is (1,5,77). Then, \\( p, q, r \\) would be 2, 6, 78. Their sum would be 2 + 6 + 78 = 86, which is way more than 26, so that's not possible.\n\nAnother triplet: (1,7,55). Then, \\( p, q, r \\) would be 2, 8, 56. Sum is 2 + 8 + 56 = 66, which is too big.\n\nAnother triplet: (1,11,35). Then, \\( p, q, r \\) would be 2, 12, 36. Sum is 2 + 12 + 36 = 50, still too big.\n\nAnother triplet: (5,5,15.4). Wait, no, 385 divided by 5 is 77, which is 7\u00d711. So, if I tried to have two 5s, then 5\u00d75\u00d715.4, but 15.4 isn't an integer, so that's not possible. So, the only triplet where all three are integers and their sum is 26 is (5,7,11), giving \\( p, q, r \\) as 6,8,12 in some order.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that. Let me check the sum: 6 + 8 + 12 = 26, yes. So that works.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can have negative factors? But since \\( p, q, r \\) are non-zero integers, \\( p - 1, q - 1, r - 1 \\) could be negative as well, but that would make \\( p, q, r \\) less than 1, which could be negative. But let's see if that's possible.\n\nSuppose one of \\( p - 1, q - 1, r - 1 \\) is negative. For example, if \\( p - 1 = -5 \\), then \\( p = -4 \\). Then, the other two factors would have to multiply to \\( 385 / (-5) = -77 \\). So, possible factors could be (-7,11) or (7,-11). Let's check if that could give a sum of 26 when 1 is added back.\n\nSo, if \\( p - 1 = -5 \\), \\( q - 1 = -7 \\), and \\( r - 1 = 11 \\), then \\( p = -4 \\), \\( q = -6 \\), \\( r = 12 \\). The sum is (-4) + (-6) + 12 = 2, which is not 26. Not good.\n\nAlternatively, if \\( p - 1 = -5 \\), \\( q - 1 = 7 \\), \\( r - 1 = -11 \\), then \\( p = -4 \\), \\( q = 8 \\), \\( r = -10 \\). Sum is (-4) + 8 + (-10) = -6, not 26.\n\nAnother possibility: \\( p - 1 = 5 \\), \\( q - 1 = -7 \\), \\( r - 1 = 11 \\). Then, \\( p = 6 \\), \\( q = -6 \\), \\( r = 12 \\). Sum is 6 + (-6) + 12 = 12, not 26.\n\nAlternatively, \\( p - 1 = 5 \\), \\( q - 1 = 7 \\), \\( r - 1 = -11 \\). Then, \\( p = 6 \\), \\( q = 8 \\), \\( r = -10 \\). Sum is 6 + 8 + (-10) = 4, not 26.\n\nHmm, seems like negative factors aren't giving me the correct sum. So, maybe the only possible triplet is the positive one: (5,7,11), leading to \\( p, q, r \\) being 6,8,12.\n\nLet me check if these values satisfy the original equations.\n\nFirst, \\( p + q + r = 6 + 8 + 12 = 26 \\). Good.\n\nNow, let's check the second equation:\n\n\\( \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{1}{12} + \\frac{360}{6 \\times 8 \\times 12} \\)\n\nCompute each term:\n\n- \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\approx 0.1667 \\)\n- \\( \\frac{1}{8} = 0.125 \\)\n- \\( \\frac{1}{12} \\approx 0.0833 \\)\n- \\( 6 \\times 8 \\times 12 = 576 \\)\n- \\( \\frac{360}{576} = \\frac{360 \u00f7 72}{576 \u00f7 72} = \\frac{5}{8} = 0.625 \\)\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n0.1667 + 0.125 = 0.2917\n\n0.2917 + 0.0833 = 0.375\n\n0.375 + 0.625 = 1.0\n\nPerfect, that adds up to 1. So, the values 6,8,12 satisfy both equations.\n\nTherefore, \\( pqr = 6 \\times 8 \\times 12 \\). Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, 6 \u00d7 8 = 48\n\nThen, 48 \u00d7 12 = 576\n\nSo, \\( pqr = 576 \\)\n\nWait, but let me make sure there aren't other possible triplets that could also satisfy the conditions. For example, maybe the triplet isn't (5,7,11) but some other combination where the factors are arranged differently, but still give the same product and sum.\n\nWait, but 385 is 5\u00d77\u00d711, and those are the only prime factors, so the only possible triplet without including 1 is (5,7,11). Any other triplet would involve 1 and larger numbers, which we saw earlier give sums way beyond 26 when 1 is added back. So, I think that's the only solution.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me check if there's another way to factor 385 into three integers, possibly including negative numbers, but as we saw earlier, that doesn't help because the sum doesn't match.\n\nSo, I think the only possible values are \\( p = 6 \\), \\( q = 8 \\), \\( r = 12 \\) (or any permutation of these), giving \\( pqr = 576 \\).\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of \\( pqr \\) is \\boxed{576}.\n</think>\n\nGiven the problem where \\( p, q, \\) and \\( r \\) are three non-zero integers such that \\( p + q + r = 26 \\) and \n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{p} + \\frac{1}{q} + \\frac{1}{r} + \\frac{360}{pqr} = 1,\n\\]\n\nwe need to find the value of \\( pqr \\).\n\nFirst, we rewrite the second equation with a common denominator \\( pqr \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{qr + pr + pq + 360}{pqr} = 1.\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\nqr + pr + pq + 360 = pqr.\n\\]\n\nRearranging, we get:\n\n\\[\npqr - pq - pr - qr = 360.\n\\]\n\nWe also know that \\( p + q + r = 26 \\). To factor the equation, we consider the identity for expanding \\( (p - 1)(q - 1)(r - 1) \\):\n\n\\[\n(p - 1)(q - 1)(r - 1) = pqr - pq - pr - qr + p + q + r - 1.\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( pqr - pq - pr - qr = 360 \\) and \\( p + q + r = 26 \\), we get:\n\n\\[\n(p - 1)(q - 1)(r - 1) = 360 + 26 - 1 = 385.\n\\]\n\nThe prime factorization of 385 is \\( 5 \\times 7 \\times 11 \\). Thus, the possible values for \\( p - 1, q - 1, r - 1 \\) are 5, 7, and 11. Adding 1 to each, we get \\( p, q, r \\) as 6, 8, and 12. \n\nVerifying the sum:\n\n\\[\n6 + 8 + 12 = 26,\n\\]\n\nand checking the second equation confirms it holds true. Therefore, the product \\( pqr \\) is:\n\n\\[\n6 \\times 8 \\times 12 = 576.\n\\]\n\nThe value of \\( pqr \\) is \\boxed{576}.",
