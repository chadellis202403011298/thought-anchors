Problem: If $\\det \\mathbf{A} = 2$ and $\\det \\mathbf{B} = 12,$ then find $\\det (\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}).$ Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this problem here: If the determinant of matrix A is 2 and the determinant of matrix B is 12, I need to find the determinant of the product of A and B, which is det(AB). Hmm, determinants, right? I remember they have something to do with the scaling factor of the linear transformation described by the matrix, but I'm not entirely sure how they behave when you multiply matrices together. Let me think.\n\nFirst, I recall that determinants have some properties, especially when dealing with matrix multiplication. I think one of the key properties is that the determinant of a product of two square matrices is equal to the product of their determinants. So, maybe det(AB) = det(A) * det(B). That seems familiar, but I should verify if that's always true.\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm not confusing this with something else. I remember that for inverses, det(A inverse) is 1 over det(A), right? And for transposes, the determinant remains the same, so det(A transpose) = det(A). So, those are different properties, but the one about the product being the product of determinants... I think that's correct, but I should check.\n\nLet me try to recall if there are any conditions where this holds. I think it's true for square matrices of the same size. So, if A and B are both n x n matrices, then det(AB) = det(A) * det(B). Since the problem gives me det(A) and det(B), it's safe to assume that A and B are square matrices of the same size, otherwise, their product wouldn't be defined. So, that must be the case here.\n\nSo, applying this property, det(AB) would just be det(A) multiplied by det(B). Given that det(A) is 2 and det(B) is 12, then det(AB) should be 2 * 12, which is 24. That seems straightforward.\n\nWait, let me think if there's any other property or exception I'm missing. For example, does this hold even if the matrices are not invertible? Because if either A or B is not invertible, their determinant would be zero, right? But in this case, det(A) is 2 and det(B) is 12, which are both non-zero, so both A and B are invertible. That means their product AB is also invertible, and the determinant of AB should indeed be the product of their determinants. So, I don't think there's any issue here.\n\nAnother thing I can consider is whether the property holds for any field, but since we're dealing with real numbers here, it's definitely applicable. I don't think there's any reason to doubt this property in this context.\n\nJust to make sure I'm not making a mistake, let me consider a simple example. Suppose A is a 2x2 matrix with determinant 2, and B is another 2x2 matrix with determinant 12. Let's pick specific matrices to test.\n\nFor example, let A be the matrix [[1, 1], [0, 2]]. The determinant of A is (1)(2) - (1)(0) = 2, which matches. Now, let B be a matrix with determinant 12. Let's choose B as [[3, 0], [0, 4]], since 3*4 - 0*0 = 12. Now, let's compute AB.\n\nAB would be:\nFirst row: [1*3 + 1*0, 1*0 + 1*4] = [3, 4]\nSecond row: [0*3 + 2*0, 0*0 + 2*4] = [0, 8]\nSo, AB is [[3, 4], [0, 8]]. The determinant of AB is (3)(8) - (4)(0) = 24. Which is indeed 2 * 12. So, this example works out.\n\nAlternatively, let me try another example where A and B are different. Suppose A is [[2, 0], [0, 1]], so det(A) = 2*1 - 0*0 = 2. Let B be [[6, 0], [0, 2]], so det(B) = 6*2 - 0*0 = 12. Then AB is [[12, 0], [0, 2]], and det(AB) is 12*2 - 0*0 = 24, which is again 2*12. So, that checks out too.\n\nWait, maybe I can try a 3x3 example, just to be thorough. Let's take A as a 3x3 matrix with det 2. Maybe A is a diagonal matrix with entries 2, 1, 1, so det(A) = 2*1*1 = 2. Let B be a 3x3 diagonal matrix with entries 6, 2, 1, so det(B) = 6*2*1 = 12. Then AB is the diagonal matrix with entries 12, 2, 1, so det(AB) = 12*2*1 = 24, which is 2*12. Yep, that works too.\n\nWait a second, what if A and B are not diagonal? Let me take A as a 2x2 matrix with rows [1, 2] and [3, 4], so determinant is (1)(4) - (2)(3) = 4 - 6 = -2. Wait, but in our problem, det(A) is 2, so maybe I need to adjust that. Let me pick another matrix. How about A = [[1, 0], [0, 2]], so determinant is 2. Then B = [[6, 0], [0, 2]], determinant is 12. Then AB is [[6, 0], [0, 4]], determinant is 24. So, same result. \n\nAlternatively, let me take A as [[1, 1], [1, 0]], which has determinant (1)(0) - (1)(1) = -1. Hmm, but I need det(A) to be 2. Maybe I can scale it. If I take A as [[2, 0], [0, 1]], that gives det(A) = 2, as before. B as [[6, 0], [0, 2]], det(B) = 12. AB is [[12, 0], [0, 2]], det(AB) = 24. So, same result again.\n\nI think I'm convinced that the property holds, and the answer is indeed 24. I don't see any reason to doubt this, given the examples I've tried and the properties I remember. So, I think the solution is straightforward: det(AB) = det(A) * det(B) = 2 * 12 = 24.\n</think>\n\nThe determinant of the product of two square matrices is equal to the product of their determinants. Therefore, det(AB) = det(A) * det(B) = 2 * 12 = 24.\n\n$\\boxed{24}$",
