What is the fifth term? Express your answer as a common fraction. Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this math problem here about an arithmetic sequence. The first four terms are given as x + y, x - y, xy, and x/y. I need to find the fifth term. Hmm, arithmetic sequences have a common difference between consecutive terms, right? So that means the difference between the first and second term should be the same as between the second and third, and so on. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall what an arithmetic sequence is. It's a sequence where each term after the first is obtained by adding a constant, called the common difference, to the preceding term. So, if I denote the terms as a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, then a2 - a1 = a3 - a2 = a4 - a3 = d, where d is the common difference.\n\nGiven that, the first four terms are:\n1. a1 = x + y\n2. a2 = x - y\n3. a3 = xy\n4. a4 = x/y\n\nSo, the differences between consecutive terms should all be equal. Let me write down the equations based on the common difference.\n\nFirst, the difference between a2 and a1 should be equal to the difference between a3 and a2:\na2 - a1 = a3 - a2\n\nSubstituting the given terms:\n(x - y) - (x + y) = (xy) - (x - y)\n\nLet me compute the left side first:\n(x - y) - (x + y) = x - y - x - y = (x - x) + (-y - y) = 0 - 2y = -2y\n\nNow the right side:\n(xy) - (x - y) = xy - x + y\n\nSo, setting them equal:\n-2y = xy - x + y\n\nHmm, that's the first equation. Let me write that down:\n-2y = xy - x + y\n\nI can rearrange this equation to bring all terms to one side:\nxy - x + y + 2y = 0\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Let me subtract -2y from both sides to get:\n0 = xy - x + y + 2y\nWait, no, that's not correct. Let me try again.\n\nWait, starting from:\n-2y = xy - x + y\n\nLet me bring all terms to the left side:\n-2y - (xy - x + y) = 0\nWhich is:\n-2y - xy + x - y = 0\nCombine like terms:\n(-2y - y) + (-xy) + x = 0\nWhich is:\n-3y - xy + x = 0\n\nHmm, that seems a bit messy. Maybe I can factor some terms. Let's see:\nx - xy - 3y = 0\nFactor x out of the first two terms:\nx(1 - y) - 3y = 0\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps yet. Let me keep this equation aside for now and see if I can get another equation from the next difference.\n\nThe next difference is between a3 and a2, which should equal the difference between a4 and a3. So:\na3 - a2 = a4 - a3\n\nSubstituting the given terms:\n(xy) - (x - y) = (x/y) - (xy)\n\nCompute the left side again:\nxy - x + y\n\nCompute the right side:\n(x/y) - xy\n\nSo, setting them equal:\nxy - x + y = (x/y) - xy\n\nLet me write that down as the second equation:\nxy - x + y = (x/y) - xy\n\nAgain, let's bring all terms to one side:\nxy - x + y - (x/y) + xy = 0\nCombine like terms:\n(2xy) - x + y - (x/y) = 0\n\nHmm, this looks complicated. Let me see if I can find a way to solve these two equations together.\n\nSo, from the first equation, we have:\n-2y = xy - x + y\nWhich I rearranged to:\nx(1 - y) - 3y = 0\nLet me write that as:\nx(1 - y) = 3y\nSo, x = 3y / (1 - y)\n\nHmm, that's an expression for x in terms of y. Maybe I can substitute this into the second equation.\n\nThe second equation is:\n2xy - x + y - (x/y) = 0\n\nLet me substitute x = 3y / (1 - y) into this equation.\n\nFirst, compute each term:\n\n2xy = 2 * (3y / (1 - y)) * y = 2 * (3y^2 / (1 - y)) = 6y^2 / (1 - y)\n\n-x = - (3y / (1 - y)) = -3y / (1 - y)\n\ny remains y.\n\n-(x/y) = - (3y / (1 - y)) / y = -3 / (1 - y)\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n6y^2 / (1 - y) - 3y / (1 - y) + y - 3 / (1 - y) = 0\n\nLet me combine the terms with the same denominator:\n\n[6y^2 - 3y - 3] / (1 - y) + y = 0\n\nHmm, that's a bit messy. Let me combine the terms:\n\nFirst, let me write y as y*(1 - y)/(1 - y) to have the same denominator:\n\n[6y^2 - 3y - 3 + y*(1 - y)] / (1 - y) = 0\n\nCompute y*(1 - y) = y - y^2\n\nSo, the numerator becomes:\n6y^2 - 3y - 3 + y - y^2 = (6y^2 - y^2) + (-3y + y) + (-3)\nWhich is:\n5y^2 - 2y - 3\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n(5y^2 - 2y - 3) / (1 - y) = 0\n\nFor a fraction to be zero, the numerator must be zero, so:\n5y^2 - 2y - 3 = 0\n\nLet me solve this quadratic equation for y.\n\nUsing the quadratic formula:\ny = [2 \u00b1 sqrt(4 + 60)] / 10\nSince sqrt(64) = 8, so:\ny = [2 \u00b1 8]/10\n\nSo, two possibilities:\n1. y = (2 + 8)/10 = 10/10 = 1\n2. y = (2 - 8)/10 = (-6)/10 = -3/5\n\nNow, y cannot be 1 because in the expression x = 3y / (1 - y), if y = 1, the denominator becomes zero, which is undefined. So, y must be -3/5.\n\nSo, y = -3/5.\n\nNow, let's find x using the expression x = 3y / (1 - y).\n\nSubstituting y = -3/5:\nx = 3*(-3/5) / (1 - (-3/5)) = (-9/5) / (1 + 3/5) = (-9/5) / (8/5) = (-9/5) * (5/8) = -9/8\n\nSo, x = -9/8 and y = -3/5.\n\nLet me check if these values satisfy the original terms and the arithmetic sequence condition.\n\nCompute the first four terms:\n\n1. a1 = x + y = (-9/8) + (-3/5) = Let's find a common denominator, which is 40:\n= (-45/40) + (-24/40) = (-69)/40\n\n2. a2 = x - y = (-9/8) - (-3/5) = (-9/8) + 3/5\nCommon denominator 40:\n= (-45/40) + 24/40 = (-21)/40\n\n3. a3 = xy = (-9/8)*(-3/5) = 27/40\n\n4. a4 = x/y = (-9/8)/(-3/5) = (-9/8)*( -5/3) = (45/24) = 15/8\n\nWait, let me check these calculations again because I think I might have made a mistake.\n\nWait, a4 is x/y, which is (-9/8)/(-3/5) = (-9/8) * (-5/3) = (45/24) which simplifies to 15/8, yes.\n\nNow, let me check the differences between consecutive terms.\n\nCompute a2 - a1:\na2 = (-21/40), a1 = (-69/40)\nSo, (-21/40) - (-69/40) = (48/40) = 6/5\n\nCompute a3 - a2:\na3 = 27/40, a2 = (-21/40)\nSo, 27/40 - (-21/40) = 48/40 = 6/5\n\nCompute a4 - a3:\na4 = 15/8, which is 75/40, a3 = 27/40\nSo, 75/40 - 27/40 = 48/40 = 6/5\n\nGreat, so the common difference d is 6/5.\n\nSo, the fifth term a5 = a4 + d = 15/8 + 6/5\n\nLet me compute that. Common denominator is 40.\n\n15/8 = 75/40, 6/5 = 48/40\nSo, 75/40 + 48/40 = 123/40\n\nWait, 75 + 48 is 123, so 123/40. Let me check if that reduces, but 123 and 40 have no common factors besides 1, so that's the answer.\n\nWait, but let me double-check all steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, found that the common difference is 6/5, so a5 should be 15/8 + 6/5. Converting to 40ths, that's 75/40 + 48/40 = 123/40. Yep, that seems correct.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me check the initial terms again with x = -9/8 and y = -3/5.\n\na1 = x + y = (-9/8) + (-3/5) = (-45/40) + (-24/40) = (-69)/40, which is correct.\n\na2 = x - y = (-9/8) - (-3/5) = (-9/8) + 3/5 = (-45/40) + 24/40 = (-21)/40, correct.\n\na3 = xy = (-9/8)*(-3/5) = 27/40, correct.\n\na4 = x/y = (-9/8)/(-3/5) = (45/24) = 15/8, correct.\n\nDifferences all equal to 6/5, so the fifth term is 15/8 + 6/5 = 123/40.\n\nWait, 123/40 can be expressed as a mixed number, but since the problem asks for a common fraction, 123/40 is acceptable.\n\nWait, just to make sure, 123 and 40 have no common factors, so that's the simplest form.\n\nSo, the fifth term is 123/40.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe fifth term is \\boxed{\\dfrac{123}{40}}.\n</think>\n\nThe first four terms in an arithmetic sequence are given as \\(x + y\\), \\(x - y\\), \\(xy\\), and \\(\\frac{x}{y}\\).
