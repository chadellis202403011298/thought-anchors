The probability of the arrow stopping on region $A$ is $\\frac{3}{8}$, the probability of it stopping in $B$ is $\\frac{1}{4}$, and the probability of it stopping in region $C$ is equal to the probability of it stopping in region $D$. What is the probability of the arrow stopping in region $C$?  Express your answer as a common fraction. Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this problem about a board game spinner, and I need to find the probability of the arrow stopping on region C. Let me try to break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, the spinner is divided into four regions: A, B, C, and D. The problem gives me the probabilities for A and B, and tells me that C and D have equal probabilities. I'm supposed to find the probability for C. Hmm, okay.\n\nLet me write down what I know. The probability of stopping on A is 3/8, and on B is 1/4. So, I can note that as P(A) = 3/8 and P(B) = 1/4. Now, the total probability for all regions should add up to 1 because the spinner must stop on one of the regions. So, P(A) + P(B) + P(C) + P(D) = 1.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that P(C) is equal to P(D). So, that means P(C) = P(D). Let me call this common probability x. So, P(C) = x and P(D) = x. \n\nNow, let's substitute all these into the equation. So, P(A) + P(B) + P(C) + P(D) becomes 3/8 + 1/4 + x + x. That simplifies to 3/8 + 1/4 + 2x. \n\nI know that 3/8 + 1/4 needs to be calculated. Let me convert 1/4 to eighths to add them easily. Since 1/4 is equal to 2/8, adding 3/8 and 2/8 gives me 5/8. So, now the equation is 5/8 + 2x = 1.\n\nTo solve for x, I'll subtract 5/8 from both sides. So, 2x = 1 - 5/8. What's 1 minus 5/8? Well, 1 is the same as 8/8, so 8/8 - 5/8 is 3/8. So, 2x = 3/8.\n\nNow, to find x, I'll divide both sides by 2. So, x = (3/8) / 2. Dividing by 2 is the same as multiplying by 1/2, so x = 3/8 * 1/2 = 3/16.\n\nWait, let me check that again. If I have 3/8 divided by 2, that's the same as 3/8 times 1/2, which is indeed 3/16. So, x, which is P(C), is 3/16.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make a mistake, let me add all the probabilities together. P(A) is 3/8, P(B) is 1/4, which is 2/8, so 3/8 + 2/8 is 5/8. Then, P(C) and P(D) are each 3/16, so together that's 6/16, which simplifies to 3/8. Adding 5/8 and 3/8 gives me 8/8, which is 1. That checks out, so I think I did this correctly.\n\nSo, the probability of the spinner stopping on region C is 3/16.\n</think>\n\nThe probability of the spinner stopping on region C is found by recognizing that the total probability must sum to 1. Given P(A) = 3/8, P(B) = 1/4, and P(C) = P(D), we set P(C) = P(D) = x. Solving 3/8 + 1/4 + 2x = 1 leads to x = 3/16.\n\n$\\boxed{\\dfrac{3}{16}}$",
