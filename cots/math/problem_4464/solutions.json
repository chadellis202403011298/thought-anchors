Problem: The squares of a chessboard are labelled with numbers, as shown below.\n\n[asy]\nunitsize(0.8 cm);\n\nint i, j;\n\nfor (i = 0; i <= 8; ++i) {\n  draw((i,0)--(i,8));\n  draw((0,i)--(8,i));\n}\n\nfor (i = 0; i <= 7; ++i) {\nfor (j = 0; j <= 7; ++j) {\n  label(\"$\\frac{1}{\" + string(i + 8 - j) + \"}$\", (i + 0.5, j + 0.5));\n}}\n[/asy]\n\nEight of the squares are chosen, so that there is exactly one chosen square in each row and each column.  Find the minimum sum of the labels of the eight chosen squares. Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this math problem about a chessboard where each square is labeled with a fraction. The goal is to choose eight squares, one in each row and each column, such that the sum of their labels is as small as possible. Hmm, sounds a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down.\n\nFirst, let me visualize the chessboard. It's an 8x8 grid, right? Each square is labeled with 1 divided by (i + 8 - j), where i and j are the row and column indices, starting from 0. Wait, so for each square in row i and column j, the label is 1/(i + 8 - j). Let me make sure I understand that correctly.\n\nLet's take the top-left square, which would be row 0, column 0. Plugging into the formula, it's 1/(0 + 8 - 0) = 1/8. Okay, that makes sense. What about the square in row 0, column 1? That would be 1/(0 + 8 - 1) = 1/7. Hmm, so as we move to the right in the same row, the denominator decreases by 1 each time, making the fraction larger. So the first row would have labels from 1/8 up to 1/1, but wait, 1/(0 + 8 - 7) = 1/1. So the first row is 1/8, 1/7, 1/6, ..., up to 1/1.\n\nSimilarly, the second row, row 1, would start with 1/(1 + 8 - 0) = 1/9, and then decrease by 1 each column: 1/9, 1/8, 1/7, ..., 1/2. Wait, but that can't be right because in the first row, the denominators go from 8 down to 1, but in the second row, they start at 9 and go down to 2. Hmm, that seems a bit confusing. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the formula is 1/(i + 8 - j). So for row i, column j, it's 1/(i + 8 - j). Let me tabulate a few values to make sure I'm getting this right.\n\nFor row 0 (top row):\n- Column 0: 1/(0 + 8 - 0) = 1/8\n- Column 1: 1/(0 + 8 - 1) = 1/7\n- Column 2: 1/(0 + 8 - 2) = 1/6\n- ...\n- Column 7: 1/(0 + 8 - 7) = 1/1\n\nSo the first row is 1/8, 1/7, 1/6, ..., 1/1.\n\nFor row 1:\n- Column 0: 1/(1 + 8 - 0) = 1/9\n- Column 1: 1/(1 + 8 - 1) = 1/8\n- Column 2: 1/(1 + 8 - 2) = 1/7\n- ...\n- Column 7: 1/(1 + 8 - 7) = 1/2\n\nWait a second, so the second row starts at 1/9 and goes down to 1/2. That means each subsequent row starts with a higher denominator and ends with a lower denominator than the row above it. So the labels in each row are increasing as we move to the right, but each row starts with a higher denominator than the row above, making the fractions smaller as we go down the rows.\n\nWait, that might not be the case. Let me think again. For row i, the label in column j is 1/(i + 8 - j). So for a fixed i, as j increases, the denominator decreases, so the fraction increases. So within each row, the labels increase from left to right.\n\nNow, across the rows, for a fixed j, as i increases, the denominator becomes i + 8 - j. So for a fixed column j, as we move down the rows (i increases), the denominator increases by 1 each time, so the fraction decreases. Therefore, in each column, the labels decrease from top to bottom.\n\nSo, in each row, the labels increase from left to right, and in each column, they decrease from top to bottom.\n\nSo, the top-left corner is the smallest label in the first row, and the smallest label in the first column. But as we move right in the first row, the labels get larger, and as we move down the first column, the labels get smaller.\n\nNow, the problem is to choose one square from each row and each column such that the sum of their labels is minimized. This is similar to a permutation problem, where each chosen square corresponds to a permutation of the columns, one per row.\n\nWait, yes, because in an 8x8 grid, choosing one square from each row and column is equivalent to finding a permutation of the columns, where each row selects a unique column.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding a permutation \u03c3 of {0,1,2,...,7} such that the sum over i from 0 to 7 of 1/(i + 8 - \u03c3(i)) is minimized.\n\nHmm, that's the mathematical formulation. Now, I need to find such a permutation \u03c3 that minimizes this sum.\n\nAlternatively, since the labels are 1/(i + 8 - \u03c3(i)), and we want to minimize the sum, perhaps it's equivalent to maximizing the sum of (i + 8 - \u03c3(i)), because 1/x is a decreasing function. So, minimizing the sum of 1/x is equivalent to maximizing the sum of x.\n\nTherefore, the problem can be restated as: find a permutation \u03c3 that maximizes the sum over i of (i + 8 - \u03c3(i)).\n\nWait, that might be a useful approach. So, if I can maximize the sum S = \u03a3(i + 8 - \u03c3(i)) from i=0 to 7, then the sum of 1/(i + 8 - \u03c3(i)) will be minimized.\n\nSo, let's compute S:\n\nS = \u03a3(i + 8 - \u03c3(i)) from i=0 to 7\n= \u03a3(i + 8) - \u03a3\u03c3(i)\n= \u03a3i + \u03a38 - \u03a3\u03c3(i)\n= (\u03a3i from 0 to7) + 8*8 - \u03a3\u03c3(i)\n\nBut since \u03c3 is a permutation of 0 to7, \u03a3\u03c3(i) = \u03a3i from 0 to7.\n\nTherefore, S = \u03a3i + 64 - \u03a3i = 64.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, regardless of the permutation \u03c3, the sum S is always 64. So, that approach doesn't help because S is constant. Therefore, my initial thought was incorrect; maximizing S isn't possible because it's fixed. So, I need another approach.\n\nHmm, maybe I should think differently. Since each term is 1/(i + 8 - \u03c3(i)), and we need to minimize the sum, perhaps we can find a way to assign the smallest possible denominators, but since the denominators are determined by the permutation, it's a bit more involved.\n\nWait, let's consider that for each row i, the label in column j is 1/(i + 8 - j). So, for row i, the smallest label is when j is as large as possible, because that makes the denominator as small as possible, hence the fraction as large as possible. But since we want to minimize the sum, we actually want the largest denominators, i.e., the smallest fractions.\n\nWait, no, wait. If we want to minimize the sum of 1/(i + 8 - j), we need each term to be as small as possible. So, each term 1/(i + 8 - j) should be as small as possible, which means (i + 8 - j) should be as large as possible.\n\nSo, for each row i, we want to choose a column j such that (i + 8 - j) is as large as possible, which would make 1/(i + 8 - j) as small as possible.\n\nBut we have the constraint that each column can be chosen only once, so it's a permutation problem where we need to assign each row to a column such that (i + 8 - j) is maximized for each i, subject to each j being used exactly once.\n\nWait, but since (i + 8 - j) = (8 - j) + i, and since i ranges from 0 to7, for each j, 8 - j is a constant, so for each j, as i increases, (i +8 -j) increases. So, for each column j, the label in row i is 1/(i +8 -j). So, for a given j, the label increases as i increases.\n\nWait, so for column j, the label in row i is 1/(i +8 -j). So, for column j, the label in row 0 is 1/(8 - j), and in row 7, it's 1/(7 +8 -j) = 1/(15 - j).\n\nWait, so for each column j, the label increases as we move down the rows. So, in column j, the smallest label is in row 0, and the largest is in row 7.\n\nBut we want to pick one label from each row and column such that the sum is minimized. So, perhaps we should pick the smallest possible labels, but we have to make sure that each column is only used once.\n\nWait, but the smallest labels are in the top-left corner, but if we pick all the top-left corners, that would require reusing columns, which isn't allowed. So, we need to pick one from each row and column, but in such a way that the sum is minimized.\n\nWait, perhaps this is similar to the assignment problem in optimization, where we have a cost matrix and we want to find the minimum cost matching. In this case, the cost matrix would be the labels on the chessboard, and we want to find a permutation that gives the minimum total cost.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the problem is equivalent to finding the minimum weight matching in a bipartite graph where one set is the rows and the other set is the columns, with edges weighted by the labels. The minimum weight matching would correspond to the permutation that gives the smallest sum.\n\nNow, the assignment problem can be solved using the Hungarian algorithm, but since this is a math problem, maybe there's a pattern or symmetry that allows us to find the minimum without going through the entire algorithm.\n\nLet me try to analyze the cost matrix. The label in row i, column j is 1/(i +8 -j). So, let me write out the cost matrix for clarity.\n\nLet's index rows from 0 to7 (top to bottom) and columns from 0 to7 (left to right). Then, the cost matrix C[i][j] = 1/(i +8 -j).\n\nLet me compute a few values to see the pattern.\n\nFor row 0:\n- C[0][0] = 1/(0+8-0) = 1/8\n- C[0][1] = 1/7\n- C[0][2] = 1/6\n- ...\n- C[0][7] = 1/1\n\nRow 1:\n- C[1][0] = 1/9\n- C[1][1] = 1/8\n- C[1][2] = 1/7\n- ...\n- C[1][7] = 1/2\n\nRow 2:\n- C[2][0] = 1/10\n- C[2][1] = 1/9\n- C[2][2] = 1/8\n- ...\n- C[2][7] = 1/3\n\n...\n\nRow 7:\n- C[7][0] = 1/15\n- C[7][1] = 1/14\n- ...\n- C[7][7] = 1/8\n\nWait, so each row starts with a higher denominator than the row above it, and the denominators decrease as we move to the right within a row. So, the top-left corner is 1/8, and as we move right, the denominators decrease, making the fractions larger.\n\nSimilarly, as we move down each column, the denominators increase, making the fractions smaller. So, in column 0, the labels go from 1/8 down to 1/15, which is smaller in the lower rows.\n\nSo, to minimize the sum, we want to pick the smallest possible labels, but we can't pick the same column more than once.\n\nWait, but the smallest labels are in the lower rows for each column. So, perhaps the minimal sum would involve picking the smallest possible labels from each column, but ensuring that each row is only used once.\n\nWait, but if we pick the smallest label from each column, which is in the lowest row for that column, but then we have to make sure that each row is only used once. So, it's a bit of a conflict because the smallest labels are in the lower rows, but we can't pick the same row more than once.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal sum is achieved by picking the diagonal from the bottom-left to the top-right. Let me check.\n\nWait, the diagonal would be where j = 7 - i, so for row i, column j = 7 - i.\n\nSo, for row 0, column 7: C[0][7] = 1/1\nRow 1, column 6: C[1][6] = 1/3\nRow 2, column 5: C[2][5] = 1/4\nRow 3, column 4: C[3][4] = 1/5\nRow 4, column 3: C[4][3] = 1/6\nRow 5, column 2: C[5][2] = 1/7\nRow 6, column 1: C[6][1] = 1/8\nRow 7, column 0: C[7][0] = 1/15\n\nWait, let me compute the sum of these:\n\n1 + 1/3 + 1/4 + 1/5 + 1/6 + 1/7 + 1/8 + 1/15\n\nHmm, that seems quite large. Wait, but maybe that's not the minimal sum. Because the diagonal might not be the optimal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal sum is achieved by selecting the smallest possible labels in such a way that each row and column is used only once. Since the labels increase as we move right and down, perhaps we can find a way to pick the smallest labels without overlapping.\n\nWait, maybe the minimal sum occurs when we pick the smallest labels from each row, but ensuring that the columns are unique. So, in row 0, the smallest label is 1/8 at column 0. Then, in row 1, the smallest available label would be 1/9 at column 0, but column 0 is already taken by row 0. So, the next smallest is 1/8 at column 1. But wait, in row 1, the labels are 1/9, 1/8, 1/7, etc. So, the smallest available label in row 1, not in column 0, would be 1/8 at column 1.\n\nBut then, in row 2, the smallest label is 1/10 at column 0, but column 0 is taken, so next is 1/9 at column 1, but column 1 is taken, so next is 1/8 at column 2.\n\nWait, but this seems like a possible approach, but I'm not sure if it leads to the minimal sum. Let me try to outline this approach.\n\nIf I pick the smallest available label in each row, avoiding used columns, perhaps I can find a minimal sum. Let's try:\n\nRow 0: column 0, 1/8\nRow 1: column 1, 1/8\nRow 2: column 2, 1/8\n...\nRow 7: column 7, 1/8\n\nWait, but that would require each row to pick a column j = i, but that would mean each row picks a different column, and the labels would all be 1/8. Wait, but in row 0, column 0 is 1/8, row 1, column 1 is 1/8, and so on up to row 7, column 7 is 1/8. So, the sum would be 8*(1/8) = 1.\n\nWait, that seems too good. Is that possible? Because if each row picks the same column, that's not allowed, but in this case, each row is picking a different column, j = i, so it's a valid permutation. So, the sum would be 8*(1/8) = 1.\n\nWait, but is that correct? Let me check the labels again.\n\nFor row i, column j = i, the label is 1/(i +8 - i) = 1/8. So, yes, each of these would be 1/8, and the sum would indeed be 1.\n\nWait, but that seems surprisingly simple. So, the minimal sum is 1? That seems too straightforward, but let me check if that's correct.\n\nWait, but in row 7, column 7, the label is 1/(7 +8 -7) = 1/8, which is correct. So, each diagonal element from (0,0) to (7,7) is 1/8, and the sum is 8*(1/8) =1.\n\nWait, but that seems to be the case. So, is the minimal sum 1?\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I choose the main diagonal, each label is 1/8, so the sum is 1. Is there a way to get a sum less than 1?\n\nWait, perhaps not, because any other permutation would have some labels larger than 1/8 and some smaller, but since the sum of eight terms each at least 1/8 would be at least 1. Wait, no, that's not necessarily true because some could be smaller and some larger, but perhaps the minimal sum is indeed 1.\n\nWait, let me think differently. If I can find a permutation where all the labels are 1/8, then the sum would be 1, which is minimal. But is that possible? Because in row i, column j = i, the label is 1/8, so yes, that's possible. Therefore, the minimal sum is 1.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that there isn't a permutation where some labels are smaller than 1/8, which would allow the sum to be less than 1.\n\nWait, in row 0, the smallest label is 1/8, so we can't get any smaller than that. In row 1, the smallest label is 1/9, but if we pick that, then in row 0, we can't pick column 0 anymore, so we have to pick a larger label in row 0. So, perhaps picking 1/9 in row 1 would require picking a larger label in row 0, which might not be beneficial.\n\nWait, let's test this. Suppose in row 1, we pick column 0, which is 1/9. Then, in row 0, we can't pick column 0, so the smallest available label in row 0 would be 1/7 in column 1. So, the sum for rows 0 and 1 would be 1/7 + 1/9 \u2248 0.1429 + 0.1111 \u2248 0.254, whereas if we pick the diagonal, it's 1/8 + 1/8 = 0.25, which is smaller. So, in this case, picking the diagonal gives a smaller sum.\n\nSimilarly, if we try to pick smaller labels in lower rows, we might have to pick larger labels in higher rows, which could result in a larger total sum.\n\nTherefore, it seems that picking the main diagonal, where each row picks its own column, resulting in all labels being 1/8, gives the minimal sum of 1.\n\nWait, but let me check another possibility. Suppose in row 0, we pick column 1, which is 1/7, and in row 1, we pick column 0, which is 1/9. Then, the sum for these two rows is 1/7 + 1/9 \u2248 0.1429 + 0.1111 \u2248 0.254, which is larger than 0.25 from picking the diagonal. So, that's worse.\n\nAlternatively, if in row 0, we pick column 2 (1/6), and in row 1, pick column 1 (1/8), the sum is 1/6 + 1/8 \u2248 0.1667 + 0.125 \u2248 0.2917, which is even worse.\n\nTherefore, it seems that deviating from the diagonal increases the sum in the early rows, which suggests that the minimal sum is indeed achieved by picking the main diagonal, giving a sum of 1.\n\nWait, but let me check another approach. Suppose we try to maximize the denominators, which would minimize the sum. So, for each row, pick the column that gives the largest possible denominator, i.e., the smallest label. But we have to ensure that each column is picked only once.\n\nIn row 0, the largest denominator is 8 (column 0). In row 1, the largest denominator is 9 (column 0), but column 0 is already taken by row 0, so the next largest is 8 (column 1). In row 2, the largest denominator is 10 (column 0), but column 0 is taken, so next is 9 (column 1), which is taken by row 1, so next is 8 (column 2). Wait, this seems to follow the diagonal again, with each row i picking column i, resulting in denominators 8,8,8,... which is the same as before.\n\nWait, but in row 3, the largest available denominator would be 11 (column 0), but column 0 is taken, so 10 (column 1) is taken, 9 (column 2) is taken, so next is 8 (column 3). So, again, following the diagonal.\n\nSo, this approach also leads to picking the main diagonal, resulting in all denominators being 8, and the sum being 8*(1/8)=1.\n\nTherefore, it seems that the minimal sum is indeed 1.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's a way to have some denominators larger than 8, which would make their reciprocals smaller than 1/8, thus potentially reducing the total sum below 1.\n\nWait, but in row 0, the largest denominator is 8, so we can't get a smaller label than 1/8 in row 0. If we try to pick a larger denominator in a lower row, say row 7, column 0, which is 15, giving 1/15, but then we have to pick another column for row 0, which would have to be at least 1/7, which is larger than 1/8. So, the sum would be 1/7 + ... + 1/15, which is more than 1.\n\nWait, let's compute that:\n\nIf in row 0, we pick column 1: 1/7\nRow 1: column 2: 1/7\nRow 2: column 3: 1/8\nRow 3: column 4: 1/9\nRow 4: column 5: 1/10\nRow 5: column 6: 1/11\nRow 6: column 7: 1/12\nRow 7: column 0: 1/15\n\nWait, but this is just a random permutation, and the sum would be:\n\n1/7 + 1/7 + 1/8 + 1/9 + 1/10 + 1/11 + 1/12 + 1/15\n\nLet me compute this approximately:\n\n1/7 \u2248 0.1429\n1/7 \u2248 0.1429\n1/8 = 0.125\n1/9 \u2248 0.1111\n1/10 = 0.1\n1/11 \u2248 0.0909\n1/12 \u2248 0.0833\n1/15 \u2248 0.0667\n\nAdding these up:\n\n0.1429 + 0.1429 = 0.2858\n+0.125 = 0.4108\n+0.1111 = 0.5219\n+0.1 = 0.6219\n+0.0909 \u2248 0.7128\n+0.0833 \u2248 0.7961\n+0.0667 \u2248 0.8628\n\nSo, the sum is approximately 0.8628, which is less than 1. Wait, that's interesting. So, maybe the minimal sum is less than 1? But that contradicts my earlier conclusion.\n\nWait, but in this permutation, I have two 1/7 terms, which isn't allowed because each column can only be used once. Wait, in this example, I picked column 1 for row 0 and column 2 for row 1, but I think I made a mistake in assigning columns. Let me correct that.\n\nWait, each column must be used exactly once, so if I pick column 1 for row 0, I can't pick it again for row 1. So, let me try to construct a valid permutation where some denominators are larger than 8, thus making some terms smaller than 1/8, but without overlapping columns.\n\nLet me try:\n\nRow 0: column 1 \u2192 1/7\nRow 1: column 2 \u2192 1/7 (Wait, no, that's the same column as row 0. Can't do that.)\n\nWait, let's try:\n\nRow 0: column 1 \u2192 1/7\nRow 1: column 3 \u2192 1/6\nRow 2: column 4 \u2192 1/5\nRow 3: column 5 \u2192 1/4\nRow 4: column 6 \u2192 1/3\nRow 5: column 7 \u2192 1/2\nRow 6: column 0 \u2192 1/9\nRow 7: column 2 \u2192 1/8\n\nWait, but this is just a random assignment, and I might be overlapping columns. Let me check:\n\n- Row 0: column 1\n- Row 1: column 3\n- Row 2: column 4\n- Row 3: column 5\n- Row 4: column 6\n- Row 5: column 7\n- Row 6: column 0\n- Row 7: column 2\n\nWait, column 2 is used by row 7, so that's okay. Let's compute the labels:\n\nRow 0: 1/7 \u2248 0.1429\nRow 1: 1/(1 +8 -3)=1/6 \u2248 0.1667\nRow 2: 1/(2 +8 -4)=1/6 \u2248 0.1667\nRow 3: 1/(3 +8 -5)=1/6 \u2248 0.1667\nRow 4: 1/(4 +8 -6)=1/6 \u2248 0.1667\nRow 5: 1/(5 +8 -7)=1/6 \u2248 0.1667\nRow 6: 1/(6 +8 -0)=1/14 \u2248 0.0714\nRow 7: 1/(7 +8 -2)=1/13 \u2248 0.0769\n\nWait, but this seems off because I'm getting multiple 1/6 terms, which might not be the case. Wait, no, let me compute each term correctly.\n\nWait, for row 1, column 3: 1/(1 +8 -3)=1/6\nRow 2, column 4: 1/(2 +8 -4)=1/6\nRow 3, column 5: 1/(3 +8 -5)=1/6\nRow 4, column 6: 1/(4 +8 -6)=1/6\nRow 5, column 7: 1/(5 +8 -7)=1/6\nRow 6, column 0: 1/(6 +8 -0)=1/14\nRow 7, column 2: 1/(7 +8 -2)=1/13\n\nSo, the sum would be:\n\n1/7 + 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/14 + 1/13\n\nLet me compute this:\n\n1/7 \u2248 0.1429\n1/6 \u2248 0.1667 (five times)\n1/14 \u2248 0.0714\n1/13 \u2248 0.0769\n\nSo:\n\n0.1429 + (5*0.1667)=0.1429 + 0.8335=0.9764\n+0.0714=1.0478\n+0.0769\u22481.1247\n\nSo, the sum is approximately 1.1247, which is more than 1. So, this permutation gives a higher sum than the diagonal approach.\n\nWait, so maybe trying to pick some larger denominators doesn't help because the other terms become too large.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal sum is indeed 1, achieved by picking the main diagonal where each term is 1/8.\n\nAlternatively, let me try another permutation where I pick columns such that the denominators are as large as possible without overlapping.\n\nFor example:\n\nRow 0: column 7 \u2192 1/1\nRow 1: column 6 \u2192 1/2\nRow 2: column 5 \u2192 1/3\nRow 3: column 4 \u2192 1/4\nRow 4: column 3 \u2192 1/5\nRow 5: column 2 \u2192 1/6\nRow 6: column 1 \u2192 1/7\nRow 7: column 0 \u2192 1/8\n\nWait, but this is the anti-diagonal. Let's compute the sum:\n\n1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + 1/5 + 1/6 + 1/7 + 1/8\n\nThat's the harmonic series up to 1/8. Let me compute that:\n\n1 = 1\n1/2 = 0.5\n1/3 \u2248 0.3333\n1/4 = 0.25\n1/5 = 0.2\n1/6 \u2248 0.1667\n1/7 \u2248 0.1429\n1/8 = 0.125\n\nAdding them up:\n\n1 + 0.5 = 1.5\n+0.3333 \u2248 1.8333\n+0.25 \u2248 2.0833\n+0.2 \u2248 2.2833\n+0.1667 \u2248 2.45\n+0.1429 \u2248 2.5929\n+0.125 \u2248 2.7179\n\nSo, the sum is approximately 2.7179, which is much larger than 1. So, that's worse.\n\nWait, so picking the anti-diagonal gives a much larger sum, so that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a permutation where some rows pick higher denominators without forcing others to pick too low.\n\nWait, but in row 0, the smallest label is 1/8, so we can't go lower than that. If we pick 1/8 in row 0, then in row 1, the next smallest label would be 1/9 in column 0, but that's already taken, so we have to pick 1/8 in column 1, and so on, leading back to the diagonal.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal sum is indeed 1, achieved by picking the main diagonal where each term is 1/8.\n\nWait, but let me try another approach. Suppose I try to assign columns to rows such that the denominator (i +8 -j) is as large as possible, but without overlapping columns. Since each row i can have j from 0 to7, and we want to maximize (i +8 -j), which is equivalent to minimizing j.\n\nWait, so for each row i, the maximum denominator is achieved when j is as small as possible. So, for row 0, maximum denominator is 8 (j=0). For row 1, maximum is 9 (j=0), but j=0 is taken by row 0, so next is j=1, giving 8. For row 2, maximum is 10 (j=0), but taken, so next is j=1, giving 9, but taken by row 1, so j=2, giving 8. So, again, this leads us to the diagonal where each row picks j=i, giving denominators of 8 each.\n\nTherefore, it seems that the minimal sum is indeed 1, achieved by picking the main diagonal.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's a way to have some denominators larger than 8 without forcing others to be smaller than 8.\n\nWait, in row 7, the maximum denominator is 15 (j=0). If I assign row 7 to column 0, then row 0 can't use column 0, so row 0 would have to pick the next best, which is j=1, giving 7. So, 1/7 in row 0. Then, row 1 can pick j=1, but that's taken, so j=2, giving 7. So, 1/7 in row 1. Wait, but this seems to lead to overlapping columns again.\n\nWait, let me try:\n\nRow 7: column 0 \u2192 1/15\nRow 6: column 1 \u2192 1/14\nRow 5: column 2 \u2192 1/13\nRow 4: column 3 \u2192 1/12\nRow 3: column 4 \u2192 1/11\nRow 2: column 5 \u2192 1/10\nRow 1: column 6 \u2192 1/9\nRow 0: column 7 \u2192 1/8\n\nWait, but this is the anti-diagonal again, which we saw gives a sum of approximately 2.7179, which is worse than 1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a different permutation where some higher rows pick higher denominators without forcing lower rows to pick too low.\n\nWait, for example:\n\nRow 7: column 0 \u2192 1/15\nRow 6: column 1 \u2192 1/14\nRow 5: column 2 \u2192 1/13\nRow 4: column 3 \u2192 1/12\nRow 3: column 4 \u2192 1/11\nRow 2: column 5 \u2192 1/10\nRow 1: column 6 \u2192 1/9\nRow 0: column 7 \u2192 1/8\n\nBut that's the same as the anti-diagonal, which gives a higher sum.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to have row 7 pick column 0 (1/15), row 6 pick column 1 (1/14), row 5 pick column 2 (1/13), row 4 pick column 3 (1/12), row 3 pick column 4 (1/11), row 2 pick column 5 (1/10), row 1 pick column 6 (1/9), and row 0 pick column 7 (1/8). So, the same as before, sum \u22482.7179.\n\nAlternatively, what if I try to have row 7 pick column 1 (1/14), row 6 pick column 2 (1/13), and so on, but I think that would lead to similar or higher sums.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the minimal sum is indeed 1, as achieved by the main diagonal, and any other permutation would result in a higher sum.\n\nTherefore, after considering various approaches",
