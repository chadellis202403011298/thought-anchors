The sum of the lengths of its $12$ edges is $208$ inches. What would be the volume of the box, in cubic inches, if its length, width and height were each increased by one inch? Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this math problem here about a rectangular box. Let me try to understand what it's asking. The problem states that the box has a volume of 4320 cubic inches, a surface area of 1704 square inches, and the sum of the lengths of its 12 edges is 208 inches. Then it's asking for the volume of the box if each of its dimensions\u2014length, width, and height\u2014are increased by one inch.\n\nHmm, okay, so first, let me recall what I know about rectangular boxes. A rectangular box has three dimensions: length (let's say l), width (w), and height (h). The volume is given by l * w * h, the surface area is 2(lw + lh + wh), and the sum of all edges is 4(l + w + h), since each dimension has four edges.\n\nSo, the problem gives me three equations:\n\n1. Volume: lwh = 4320\n2. Surface area: 2(lw + lh + wh) = 1704\n3. Sum of edges: 4(l + w + h) = 208\n\nI need to find the new volume when each dimension is increased by one inch. So, the new dimensions would be (l + 1), (w + 1), and (h + 1), and the new volume would be (l + 1)(w + 1)(h + 1).\n\nBut before I can find the new volume, I probably need to figure out the original values of l, w, and h. Once I have those, I can compute the new volume by expanding the expression (l + 1)(w + 1)(h + 1).\n\nLet me start by simplifying the given equations.\n\nFirst, let's take the sum of edges equation: 4(l + w + h) = 208. If I divide both sides by 4, I get l + w + h = 52. Let me write that down:\n\nl + w + h = 52. (Equation 1)\n\nNext, the surface area equation: 2(lw + lh + wh) = 1704. If I divide both sides by 2, that becomes lw + lh + wh = 852. Let me note that as:\n\nlw + lh + wh = 852. (Equation 2)\n\nAnd the volume equation is lwh = 4320. (Equation 3)\n\nSo, now I have three equations with three variables. I think I can use these to solve for l, w, and h.\n\nLet me recall that for a cubic equation, if I have the sum of roots, sum of products, and product of roots, I can form the equation as x^3 - (sum)x^2 + (sum of products)x - product = 0. So, in this case, if I let x be the roots l, w, h, then the cubic equation would be:\n\nx^3 - (l + w + h)x^2 + (lw + lh + wh)x - lwh = 0\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\nx^3 - 52x^2 + 852x - 4320 = 0\n\nSo, I need to solve this cubic equation to find the values of l, w, and h.\n\nHmm, solving a cubic equation might be a bit tricky, but maybe I can factor it or find rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem. The possible rational roots would be factors of 4320 divided by factors of 1, so possible integer roots are the divisors of 4320.\n\nLet me list some possible integer roots. Since 4320 is a large number, maybe I can test some smaller integers first.\n\nLet me try x = 10. Plugging into the equation:\n\n10^3 - 52*10^2 + 852*10 - 4320 = 1000 - 5200 + 8520 - 4320\n\nCalculating step by step:\n\n1000 - 5200 = -4200\n\n-4200 + 8520 = 4320\n\n4320 - 4320 = 0\n\nOh, so x = 10 is a root. That means (x - 10) is a factor of the cubic equation.\n\nNow, I can perform polynomial division or use synthetic division to factor out (x - 10) from the cubic equation.\n\nLet me use synthetic division:\n\nDividing x^3 - 52x^2 + 852x - 4320 by (x - 10).\n\nSet up synthetic division with root 10:\n\n10 | 1   -52    852    -4320\n\nBring down the 1.\n\n1\n\nMultiply 1 by 10: 10, add to -52: -42\n\n-42\n\nMultiply -42 by 10: -420, add to 852: 432\n\n432\n\nMultiply 432 by 10: 4320, add to -4320: 0\n\nSo, the cubic factors into (x - 10)(x^2 - 42x + 432) = 0\n\nNow, I need to factor the quadratic equation x^2 - 42x + 432 = 0.\n\nLooking for two numbers that multiply to 432 and add up to -42. Let's see:\n\nFactors of 432: 1 & 432, 2 & 216, 3 & 144, 4 & 108, 6 & 72, 8 & 54, 9 & 48, 12 & 36, 16 & 27, 18 & 24.\n\nLooking for a pair that adds up to 42. Let's check 18 and 24: 18 + 24 = 42, and 18*24 = 432.\n\nSo, the quadratic factors as (x - 18)(x - 24) = 0.\n\nSo, the roots are x = 10, x = 18, x = 24.\n\nTherefore, the dimensions of the box are 10, 18, and 24 inches.\n\nLet me double-check these values to make sure they satisfy all three original equations.\n\nFirst, sum: 10 + 18 + 24 = 52. That matches Equation 1.\n\nNext, surface area: 2(lw + lh + wh) = 2(10*18 + 10*24 + 18*24) = 2(180 + 240 + 432) = 2(852) = 1704. That matches Equation 2.\n\nVolume: 10*18*24 = 4320. That matches Equation 3.\n\nGreat, so the dimensions are correct.\n\nNow, the problem asks for the volume when each dimension is increased by one inch. So, the new dimensions will be 11, 19, and 25 inches.\n\nI need to compute the new volume: 11 * 19 * 25.\n\nLet me compute this step by step.\n\nFirst, 11 * 19: 11*20 = 220, minus 11, so 220 - 11 = 209.\n\nNow, multiply 209 by 25.\n\n209 * 25: Let me think of 25 as 100/4, so 209 * 100 = 20900, divided by 4 is 5225.\n\nAlternatively, 209 * 25 can be calculated as:\n\n200*25 = 5000\n\n9*25 = 225\n\nSo, 5000 + 225 = 5225.\n\nEither way, the new volume is 5225 cubic inches.\n\nWait, let me verify that multiplication again because it's easy to make a mistake.\n\n11 * 19: 10*19=190, plus 1*19=19, so 190+19=209. Correct.\n\n209 * 25: 209 * 20 = 4180, 209 * 5 = 1045, so 4180 + 1045 = 5225. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the new volume after increasing each dimension by one inch is 5225 cubic inches.\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make any miscalculations, let me check the dimensions again: original dimensions 10, 18, 24. Adding 1 to each gives 11, 19, 25. Multiplying those: 11*19=209, 209*25=5225. Yep, that seems right.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. So, the volume increases from 4320 to 5225 cubic inches when each dimension is increased by one inch.\n</think>\n\nThe original dimensions of the box are 10 inches, 18 inches, and 24 inches. After increasing each dimension by one inch, the new dimensions become 11 inches, 19 inches, and 25 inches. Calculating the new volume:\n\n11 * 19 = 209  \n209 * 25 = 5225\n\nThe new volume is 5225 cubic inches.\n\n$\\boxed{5225}$",
