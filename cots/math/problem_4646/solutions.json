Problem: Solve the inequality\n\\[2 - \\frac{1}{2x + 3} < 4.\\] Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I need to solve this inequality: \\(2 - \\frac{1}{2x + 3} < 4\\). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that when dealing with inequalities involving fractions, I have to be careful about the denominator because it can't be zero, and also because multiplying both sides by a negative number reverses the inequality sign. So, first, maybe I should isolate the fraction to make things clearer.\n\nLet me start by subtracting 2 from both sides to get rid of that constant term on the left. So, subtracting 2 gives me:\n\n\\[-\\frac{1}{2x + 3} < 4 - 2\\]\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n\\[-\\frac{1}{2x + 3} < 2\\]\n\nHmm, okay, now I have \\(-\\frac{1}{2x + 3}\\) less than 2. I think I can multiply both sides by -1 to make the fraction positive, but wait, I remember that when I multiply or divide both sides of an inequality by a negative number, the inequality sign flips. So, let me do that.\n\nMultiplying both sides by -1 (and flipping the inequality sign) gives:\n\n\\[\\frac{1}{2x + 3} > -2\\]\n\nAlright, so now I have \\(\\frac{1}{2x + 3} > -2\\). I need to solve for x here. Let me think about how to handle this. I can write this inequality as:\n\n\\[\\frac{1}{2x + 3} + 2 > 0\\]\n\nWait, maybe that's complicating things. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider two cases: one where \\(2x + 3\\) is positive, and another where it's negative. Because depending on the sign of the denominator, the inequality might behave differently.\n\nSo, let's consider the denominator \\(2x + 3\\). It cannot be zero, so \\(2x + 3 \\neq 0\\), which means \\(x \\neq -\\frac{3}{2}\\). That's an important point because the function is undefined there.\n\nCase 1: \\(2x + 3 > 0\\). That is, \\(x > -\\frac{3}{2}\\). In this case, since the denominator is positive, multiplying both sides of the inequality by it won't change the direction of the inequality. So, starting from \\(\\frac{1}{2x + 3} > -2\\), multiplying both sides by \\(2x + 3\\) (which is positive, so inequality sign stays the same) gives:\n\n\\(1 > -2(2x + 3)\\)\n\nLet me compute the right side:\n\n\\(1 > -4x - 6\\)\n\nNow, I can add 6 to both sides:\n\n\\(1 + 6 > -4x\\)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n\\(7 > -4x\\)\n\nThen, dividing both sides by -4, but wait, I have to remember that dividing by a negative number reverses the inequality. So, dividing both sides by -4 gives:\n\n\\(-\\frac{7}{4} < x\\)\n\nBut wait, that's in the context where \\(x > -\\frac{3}{2}\\). So, combining these two conditions, \\(x > -\\frac{3}{2}\\) and \\(x > -\\frac{7}{4}\\). But since \\(-\\frac{7}{4}\\) is -1.75 and \\(-\\frac{3}{2}\\) is -1.5, which is larger. So, the condition \\(x > -\\frac{3}{2}\\) is more restrictive. Therefore, in this case, the solution is \\(x > -\\frac{3}{2}\\).\n\nCase 2: \\(2x + 3 < 0\\), which implies \\(x < -\\frac{3}{2}\\). In this scenario, the denominator is negative, so when I multiply both sides of the inequality by \\(2x + 3\\), the inequality sign will flip. Starting again from \\(\\frac{1}{2x + 3} > -2\\), multiplying both sides by \\(2x + 3\\) (which is negative) gives:\n\n\\(1 < -2(2x + 3)\\)\n\nLet me compute the right side:\n\n\\(1 < -4x - 6\\)\n\nNow, add 6 to both sides:\n\n\\(1 + 6 < -4x\\)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n\\(7 < -4x\\)\n\nDividing both sides by -4 (and flipping the inequality sign again):\n\n\\(-\\frac{7}{4} > x\\)\n\nOr, equivalently, \\(x < -\\frac{7}{4}\\)\n\nBut remember, in this case, we're considering \\(x < -\\frac{3}{2}\\), which is -1.5. So, \\(x < -\\frac{7}{4}\\) is -1.75, which is more restrictive than \\(x < -\\frac{3}{2}\\). Therefore, in this case, the solution is \\(x < -\\frac{7}{4}\\).\n\nNow, putting both cases together, the solution set is all real numbers where \\(x < -\\frac{7}{4}\\) or \\(x > -\\frac{3}{2}\\). But I need to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my steps.\n\nWait, let me check my work. Starting from the original inequality:\n\n\\(2 - \\frac{1}{2x + 3} < 4\\)\n\nSubtract 2:\n\n\\(-\\frac{1}{2x + 3} < 2\\)\n\nMultiply both sides by -1 (and flip inequality):\n\n\\(\\frac{1}{2x + 3} > -2\\)\n\nThen, I considered two cases based on the denominator.\n\nIn Case 1: \\(2x + 3 > 0\\), so \\(x > -\\frac{3}{2}\\). Then:\n\n\\(\\frac{1}{2x + 3} > -2\\)\n\nMultiply both sides by \\(2x + 3\\):\n\n\\(1 > -2(2x + 3)\\)\n\nWhich gives:\n\n\\(1 > -4x - 6\\)\n\nAdding 6:\n\n\\(7 > -4x\\)\n\nDivide by -4 (flip inequality):\n\n\\(-\\frac{7}{4} < x\\)\n\nBut since in this case \\(x > -\\frac{3}{2}\\), the solution is \\(x > -\\frac{3}{2}\\), as \\(-\\frac{3}{2}\\) is greater than \\(-\\frac{7}{4}\\).\n\nIn Case 2: \\(2x + 3 < 0\\), so \\(x < -\\frac{3}{2}\\). Then:\n\n\\(\\frac{1}{2x + 3} > -2\\)\n\nMultiply both sides by \\(2x + 3\\), which is negative, so flip inequality:\n\n\\(1 < -2(2x + 3)\\)\n\nWhich gives:\n\n\\(1 < -4x - 6\\)\n\nAdding 6:\n\n\\(7 < -4x\\)\n\nDivide by -4 (flip inequality):\n\n\\(-\\frac{7}{4} > x\\)\n\nSo, \\(x < -\\frac{7}{4}\\).\n\nTherefore, combining both cases, the solution is \\(x < -\\frac{7}{4}\\) or \\(x > -\\frac{3}{2}\\).\n\nBut let me test a value in each interval to make sure.\n\nFirst interval: \\(x < -\\frac{7}{4}\\), say \\(x = -2\\).\n\nPlugging into original inequality:\n\n\\(2 - \\frac{1}{2(-2) + 3} = 2 - \\frac{1}{-4 + 3} = 2 - \\frac{1}{-1} = 2 + 1 = 3\\). So, 3 < 4? Yes, that's true.\n\nSecond interval: \\(x > -\\frac{3}{2}\\), say \\(x = 0\\).\n\nPlugging in:\n\n\\(2 - \\frac{1}{2(0) + 3} = 2 - \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{6}{3} - \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{5}{3}\\). Is \\(\\frac{5}{3} < 4\\)? Yes, that's true.\n\nWhat about between \\(-\\frac{7}{4}\\) and \\(-\\frac{3}{2}\\), say \\(x = -2\\). Wait, that's the same as before. Wait, let me pick a number between \\(-\\frac{7}{4}\\) (-1.75) and \\(-\\frac{3}{2}\\) (-1.5), like \\(x = -1.6\\).\n\nPlugging in:\n\n\\(2 - \\frac{1}{2(-1.6) + 3} = 2 - \\frac{1}{-3.2 + 3} = 2 - \\frac{1}{-0.2} = 2 + 5 = 7\\). Is 7 < 4? No, that's false. So, the inequality doesn't hold there, which confirms that the solution is indeed \\(x < -\\frac{7}{4}\\) or \\(x > -\\frac{3}{2}\\).\n\nWait, but let me check another point in \\(x < -\\frac{7}{4}\\), say \\(x = -3\\).\n\nPlugging in:\n\n\\(2 - \\frac{1}{2(-3) + 3} = 2 - \\frac{1}{-6 + 3} = 2 - \\frac{1}{-3} = 2 + \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{7}{3}\\). Is \\(\\frac{7}{3} < 4\\)? Yes, because \\(\\frac{7}{3}\\) is approximately 2.333, which is less than 4.\n\nWait, but earlier when I tested \\(x = -2\\), I got 3, which is also less than 4, so that's correct.\n\nWait, but when I tested \\(x = -1.6\\), which is between \\(-\\frac{7}{4}\\) (-1.75) and \\(-\\frac{3}{2}\\) (-1.5), I got 7, which is not less than 4, so that interval isn't part of the solution.\n\nWait, but let me check another point in \\(x > -\\frac{3}{2}\\), say \\(x = 1\\).\n\nPlugging in:\n\n\\(2 - \\frac{1}{2(1) + 3} = 2 - \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{10}{5} - \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{9}{5}\\), which is 1.8, less than 4. Correct.\n\nWait, but what about when \\(x\\) approaches \\(-\\frac{3}{2}\\) from the right? Let me pick \\(x = -1.4\\).\n\nPlugging in:\n\n\\(2 - \\frac{1}{2(-1.4) + 3} = 2 - \\frac{1}{-2.8 + 3} = 2 - \\frac{1}{0.2} = 2 - 5 = -3\\), which is less than 4. So, that works.\n\nWait, but when \\(x\\) approaches \\(-\\frac{3}{2}\\) from the left, say \\(x = -1.6\\), which is less than \\(-\\frac{3}{2}\\), we saw that it didn't work. So, the solution set is indeed \\(x < -\\frac{7}{4}\\) or \\(x > -\\frac{3}{2}\\).\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just write it in interval notation to make sure.\n\nSo, \\(x < -\\frac{7}{4}\\) is \\((-\\infty, -\\frac{7}{4})\\) and \\(x > -\\frac{3}{2}\\) is \\((- \\frac{3}{2}, \\infty)\\). So, the solution is the union of these two intervals.\n\nWait, but I should also check the point where \\(2x + 3 = 0\\), which is \\(x = -\\frac{3}{2}\\). At this point, the original expression is undefined because the denominator is zero, so \\(x = -\\frac{3}{2}\\) is excluded from the solution set, which matches our earlier result.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the solution is all real numbers less than \\(-\\frac{7}{4}\\) and all real numbers greater than \\(-\\frac{3}{2}\\).\n\nI think that's the correct solution. Let me just recap the steps to ensure I didn't skip anything:\n\n1. Subtract 2 from both sides.\n2. Multiply both sides by -1 and reverse the inequality.\n3. Consider two cases based on the sign of the denominator.\n4. Solve each case separately, considering the restrictions on x.\n5. Verify the solution with test points in each interval.\n6. Confirm that the excluded point is indeed excluded.\n\nYes, that all checks out. So, I'm confident that the solution is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe solution to the inequality is \\(\\boxed{x < -\\frac{7}{4} \\text{ or } x > -\\frac{3}{2}}\\).\n</think>\n\nTo solve the inequality \\(2 - \\frac{1}{2x + 3} < 4\\), we start by isolating the fraction. \n\n1.
