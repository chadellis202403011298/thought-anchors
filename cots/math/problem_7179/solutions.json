Problem: Find the degree measure of the least positive angle $\\theta$ for which\n\\[\\cos 5^\\circ = \\sin 25^\\circ + \\sin \\theta.\\] Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this trigonometry problem to solve, and I want to make sure I understand it correctly before jumping in. The problem says:\n\nFind the degree measure of the least positive angle \u03b8 for which\ncos 5\u00b0 = sin 25\u00b0 + sin \u03b8.\n\nAlright, so I need to find \u03b8 such that when I add sin \u03b8 to sin 25\u00b0, the result is equal to cos 5\u00b0. And I need the least positive angle, so \u03b8 should be between 0\u00b0 and 360\u00b0, I suppose.\n\nFirst, let me recall some trigonometric identities that might help here. I know that sin and cos are related through complementary angles, meaning that sin(x) = cos(90\u00b0 - x). Maybe that can help me rewrite one side in terms of the other.\n\nLooking at the equation: cos 5\u00b0 = sin 25\u00b0 + sin \u03b8.\n\nHmm, I can see that both sides involve trigonometric functions, so perhaps I can manipulate this equation using identities to solve for \u03b8.\n\nLet me first write down the equation again:\n\ncos 5\u00b0 = sin 25\u00b0 + sin \u03b8.\n\nI want to solve for \u03b8, so maybe I can isolate sin \u03b8 first. Let me subtract sin 25\u00b0 from both sides:\n\ncos 5\u00b0 - sin 25\u00b0 = sin \u03b8.\n\nSo, sin \u03b8 = cos 5\u00b0 - sin 25\u00b0.\n\nNow, I need to compute the right side to find the value of sin \u03b8. Let me compute cos 5\u00b0 and sin 25\u00b0 separately.\n\nBut wait, before I do that, maybe I can find a way to express cos 5\u00b0 - sin 25\u00b0 using a trigonometric identity. I remember that there are identities for the difference of sines and cosines, but I'm not sure exactly which one applies here. Alternatively, perhaps I can express both terms in terms of sine or cosine functions with the same angle.\n\nWait, let me think about this: cos 5\u00b0 is the same as sin(90\u00b0 - 5\u00b0) because of the complementary angle identity. So, cos 5\u00b0 = sin 85\u00b0. So, substituting that into the equation, I get:\n\nsin 85\u00b0 - sin 25\u00b0 = sin \u03b8.\n\nSo, sin \u03b8 = sin 85\u00b0 - sin 25\u00b0.\n\nNow, I can use the sine subtraction formula, which is:\n\nsin A - sin B = 2 cos[(A + B)/2] sin[(A - B)/2].\n\nLet me apply that here, where A is 85\u00b0 and B is 25\u00b0.\n\nSo, sin 85\u00b0 - sin 25\u00b0 = 2 cos[(85 + 25)/2] sin[(85 - 25)/2].\n\nCalculating the terms inside the cos and sin:\n\n(85 + 25)/2 = 110/2 = 55\u00b0.\n\n(85 - 25)/2 = 60/2 = 30\u00b0.\n\nSo, this becomes 2 cos 55\u00b0 sin 30\u00b0.\n\nI know that sin 30\u00b0 is 0.5, so substituting that in:\n\n2 cos 55\u00b0 * 0.5 = cos 55\u00b0.\n\nSo, sin \u03b8 = cos 55\u00b0.\n\nBut wait, I can also express cos 55\u00b0 as sin(90\u00b0 - 55\u00b0) = sin 35\u00b0, because cos x = sin(90\u00b0 - x). So, cos 55\u00b0 = sin 35\u00b0.\n\nTherefore, sin \u03b8 = sin 35\u00b0.\n\nNow, when does sin \u03b8 equal sin 35\u00b0? Well, the general solution for sin \u03b8 = sin \u03b1 is \u03b8 = \u03b1 + 360\u00b0k or \u03b8 = 180\u00b0 - \u03b1 + 360\u00b0k, where k is any integer.\n\nSo, in this case, \u03b1 is 35\u00b0, so the solutions would be \u03b8 = 35\u00b0 + 360\u00b0k or \u03b8 = 180\u00b0 - 35\u00b0 + 360\u00b0k, which is \u03b8 = 145\u00b0 + 360\u00b0k.\n\nBut we're looking for the least positive angle \u03b8, so let's consider k=0 first.\n\nSo, \u03b8 = 35\u00b0 or \u03b8 = 145\u00b0.\n\nNow, we need to check which of these solutions is valid in the original equation, because sometimes when we use identities, we might introduce extraneous solutions.\n\nLet me check \u03b8 = 35\u00b0 first.\n\nCompute sin 35\u00b0, which is approximately 0.5736.\n\nCompute sin 25\u00b0, which is approximately 0.4226.\n\nSo, sin 25\u00b0 + sin 35\u00b0 \u2248 0.4226 + 0.5736 \u2248 0.9962.\n\nNow, compute cos 5\u00b0, which is approximately 0.9962.\n\nHmm, that's very close, so \u03b8 = 35\u00b0 seems to work.\n\nNow, let's check \u03b8 = 145\u00b0.\n\nCompute sin 145\u00b0, which is sin(180\u00b0 - 35\u00b0) = sin 35\u00b0 \u2248 0.5736.\n\nSo, sin 25\u00b0 + sin 145\u00b0 \u2248 0.4226 + 0.5736 \u2248 0.9962, which again is equal to cos 5\u00b0. So, both \u03b8 = 35\u00b0 and \u03b8 = 145\u00b0 satisfy the equation.\n\nBut the problem asks for the least positive angle, so between 35\u00b0 and 145\u00b0, the smaller one is 35\u00b0, so \u03b8 = 35\u00b0 is the answer.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me go through my steps again to see if I made any mistakes.\n\nStarting with the original equation:\n\ncos 5\u00b0 = sin 25\u00b0 + sin \u03b8.\n\nI converted cos 5\u00b0 to sin 85\u00b0, so the equation became sin 85\u00b0 = sin 25\u00b0 + sin \u03b8.\n\nThen, moving sin 25\u00b0 to the left, I got sin 85\u00b0 - sin 25\u00b0 = sin \u03b8.\n\nUsing the sine subtraction formula, I converted that to 2 cos 55\u00b0 sin 30\u00b0, which simplifies to cos 55\u00b0, because 2 * cos 55\u00b0 * 0.5 = cos 55\u00b0.\n\nThen, I converted cos 55\u00b0 to sin 35\u00b0, so sin \u03b8 = sin 35\u00b0, leading to \u03b8 = 35\u00b0 or 145\u00b0, and since we're looking for the least positive angle, \u03b8 = 35\u00b0.\n\nThat seems correct, but let me double-check the calculation where I substituted cos 55\u00b0 as sin 35\u00b0. Yes, because 55\u00b0 + 35\u00b0 = 90\u00b0, so cos 55\u00b0 = sin 35\u00b0, which is correct.\n\nWait, but let me also consider another approach. Maybe I can compute both sides numerically to confirm.\n\nCompute cos 5\u00b0: Using a calculator, cos(5\u00b0) \u2248 0.996194698.\n\nCompute sin 25\u00b0 + sin \u03b8: Let's compute when \u03b8 = 35\u00b0, sin 35\u00b0 \u2248 0.573576436, so sin 25\u00b0 + sin 35\u00b0 \u2248 0.422618262 + 0.573576436 \u2248 0.996194698, which is equal to cos 5\u00b0, so that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, when \u03b8 = 145\u00b0, sin 145\u00b0 = sin(35\u00b0) \u2248 0.573576436, so adding sin 25\u00b0 gives the same result, so that's also correct.\n\nTherefore, both \u03b8 = 35\u00b0 and \u03b8 = 145\u00b0 are valid solutions, but the least positive angle is 35\u00b0, so \u03b8 = 35\u00b0 is the answer.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me check if there's any possibility that \u03b8 could be negative or something, but since the problem asks for the least positive angle, we can ignore negative angles, so 35\u00b0 is indeed the smallest positive solution.\n\nSo, after all that, I think \u03b8 = 35\u00b0 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe least positive angle \u03b8 is \\boxed{35} degrees.\n</think>\n\nWe start with the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\cos 5^\\circ = \\sin 25^\\circ + \\sin \\theta\n\\]\n\nFirst, we isolate \\(\\sin \\theta\\) by subtracting \\(\\sin 25^\\circ\\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\n\\cos 5^\\circ - \\sin 25^\\circ = \\sin \\theta\n\\]\n\nWe use the identity \\(\\cos x = \\sin(90^\\circ - x)\\) to rewrite \\(\\cos 5^\\circ\\) as \\(\\sin 85^\\circ\\):\n\n\\[\n\\sin 85^\\circ - \\sin 25^\\circ = \\sin \\theta\n\\]\n\nNext, we apply the sine subtraction formula:\n\n\\[\n\\sin A - \\sin B = 2 \\cos\\left(\\frac{A + B}{2}\\right) \\sin\\left(\\frac{A - B}{2}\\right)\n\\]\n\nHere, \\(A = 85^\\circ\\) and \\(B = 25^\\circ\\), so:\n\n\\[\n\\sin 85^\\circ - \\sin 25^\\circ = 2 \\cos\\left(\\frac{85^\\circ + 25^\\circ}{2}\\right) \\sin\\left(\\frac{85^\\circ - 25^\\circ}{2}\\right)\n\\]\n\nCalculating the terms inside the cosine and sine:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{85^\\circ + 25^\\circ}{2} = 55^\\circ \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{85^\\circ - 25^\\circ}{2} = 30^\\circ\n\\]\n\nThus, we have:\n\n\\[\n2 \\cos 55^\\circ \\sin 30^\\circ\n\\]\n\nSince \\(\\sin 30^\\circ = 0.5\\), this simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n2 \\cos 55^\\circ \\cdot 0.5 = \\cos 55^\\circ\n\\]\n\nWe convert \\(\\cos 55^\\circ\\) to \\(\\sin 35^\\circ\\) using the identity \\(\\cos x = \\sin(90^\\circ - x)\\):\n\n\\[\n\\sin \\theta = \\sin 35^\\circ\n\\]\n\nThe general solutions for \\(\\sin \\theta = \\sin 35^\\circ\\) are:\n\n\\[\n\\theta = 35^\\circ + 360^\\circ k \\quad \\text{or} \\quad \\theta = 180^\\circ - 35^\\circ + 360^\\circ k\n\\]\n\nFor the least positive angle, we consider \\(k = 0\\):\n\n\\[\n\\theta = 35^\\circ \\quad \\text{or} \\quad \\theta = 145^\\circ\n\\]\n\nThe smallest positive angle is \\(35^\\circ\\).\n\nThus, the least positive angle \\(\\theta\\) is \\(\\boxed{35}\\) degrees.",
