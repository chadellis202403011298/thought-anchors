Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this equation to solve: \u221a(1 + \u221a(2y - 3)) = \u221a6. Hmm, let me try to figure out how to approach this. I remember that when dealing with square roots, a good strategy is to square both sides of the equation to eliminate the outer square root. Let me try that.\n\nFirst, I'll write down the equation again to make sure I have it right:\n\u221a(1 + \u221a(2y - 3)) = \u221a6.\n\nAlright, so if I square both sides, that should get rid of the square root on the left side. Let's do that:\n(\u221a(1 + \u221a(2y - 3)))\u00b2 = (\u221a6)\u00b2.\n\nSimplifying both sides, the left side becomes just 1 + \u221a(2y - 3), and the right side becomes 6. So now the equation is:\n1 + \u221a(2y - 3) = 6.\n\nHmm, okay, that looks simpler. Now, I need to solve for y. Let me isolate the remaining square root first. I'll subtract 1 from both sides:\n\u221a(2y - 3) = 6 - 1,\nwhich simplifies to:\n\u221a(2y - 3) = 5.\n\nGreat, now I have another square root equation. Again, I can square both sides to eliminate this square root. Let's do that:\n(\u221a(2y - 3))\u00b2 = 5\u00b2.\n\nSimplifying both sides, the left side becomes 2y - 3, and the right side becomes 25. So now I have:\n2y - 3 = 25.\n\nNow, I just need to solve for y. Let me add 3 to both sides:\n2y = 25 + 3,\nwhich simplifies to:\n2y = 28.\n\nThen, I'll divide both sides by 2 to get y by itself:\ny = 28 / 2,\nso y = 14.\n\nWait a second, I should check if this solution makes sense in the original equation. Sometimes, when we square both sides of an equation, we can introduce extraneous solutions that don't actually satisfy the original equation. Let me plug y = 14 back into the original equation to verify.\n\nStarting with the left side:\n\u221a(1 + \u221a(2*14 - 3)).\n\nCalculating inside the inner square root first:\n2*14 = 28,\n28 - 3 = 25.\n\nSo now, the expression becomes:\n\u221a(1 + \u221a25).\n\nSince \u221a25 is 5, this simplifies to:\n\u221a(1 + 5) = \u221a6.\n\nWhich matches the right side of the original equation, \u221a6. So, y = 14 is indeed a valid solution.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, let me go through the steps again quickly.\n\n1. Start with \u221a(1 + \u221a(2y - 3)) = \u221a6.\n2. Square both sides: 1 + \u221a(2y - 3) = 6.\n3. Subtract 1: \u221a(2y - 3) = 5.\n4. Square again: 2y - 3 = 25.\n5. Add 3: 2y = 28.\n6. Divide by 2: y = 14.\n\nEverything checks out, and the solution works when substituted back into the original equation. So I think I've got it right.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the equation \u221a(1 + \u221a(2y - 3)) = \u221a6, follow these steps:\n\n1. Square both sides to eliminate the outer square root:\n   (\u221a(1 + \u221a(2y - 3)))\u00b2 = (\u221a6)\u00b2\n   \u2192 1 + \u221a(2y - 3) = 6\n\n2. Subtract 1 from both sides:\n   \u221a(2y - 3) = 5\n\n3. Square both sides again to remove the remaining square root:\n   (\u221a(2y - 3))\u00b2 = 5\u00b2\n   \u2192 2y - 3 = 25\n\n4. Add 3 to both sides:\n   2y = 28\n\n5. Divide by 2 to solve for y:\n   y = 14\n\n**Answer:** y = 14\n\n$\\boxed{14}$",
