Express your answer as a common fraction. Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the expected number of 1's when rolling two standard dice. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that expectation is like the average outcome we'd expect over many trials. So, maybe I can calculate the average number of 1's appearing when two dice are rolled.\n\nFirst, let me recall that each die has numbers from 1 to 6, and each number has an equal chance of appearing, right? So the probability of rolling a 1 on a single die is 1/6, and the probability of not rolling a 1 is 5/6. Since we're rolling two dice, I guess I can consider each die separately and then add up their individual expectations.\n\nWait, that makes sense because expectation is linear, so the expected value of the sum is the sum of the expected values. So, if I let X be the number of 1's on the first die and Y be the number of 1's on the second die, then the total number of 1's is X + Y. Therefore, the expected value E[X + Y] should be E[X] + E[Y].\n\nNow, what's E[X]? For a single die, the expected number of 1's is just the probability of rolling a 1, which is 1/6. Similarly, E[Y] is also 1/6. So adding them together, E[X + Y] = 1/6 + 1/6 = 2/6, which simplifies to 1/3.\n\nWait, is that right? Let me double-check. Each die has a 1/6 chance of showing a 1, so for two dice, the expected number of 1's should be 2*(1/6) = 1/3. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach it by considering all possible outcomes when rolling two dice. There are 6 sides on each die, so 6*6 = 36 possible outcomes. Now, how many of these outcomes result in 0, 1, or 2 ones?\n\n- For 0 ones: Neither die shows a 1. Each die has 5 possibilities (2-6), so 5*5 = 25 outcomes.\n- For 1 one: Either the first die is 1 and the second isn't, or the second die is 1 and the first isn't. So that's 1*5 + 5*1 = 10 outcomes.\n- For 2 ones: Both dice show 1, which is 1 outcome.\n\nLet me check: 25 + 10 + 1 = 36, which matches the total number of outcomes. Good.\n\nNow, the expected value E is calculated as the sum over all possible values multiplied by their probabilities. So:\n\nE = (0 * 25/36) + (1 * 10/36) + (2 * 1/36)\n= 0 + 10/36 + 2/36\n= 12/36\n= 1/3.\n\nHmm, that's the same answer as before. So both methods give me 1/3. That seems consistent.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the second method. Let me recalculate the probabilities:\n\n- The probability of 0 ones is 25/36, correct.\n- The probability of exactly 1 one is 10/36, since there are 10 favorable outcomes.\n- The probability of exactly 2 ones is 1/36.\n\nSo, E = 0*(25/36) + 1*(10/36) + 2*(1/36) = 10/36 + 2/36 = 12/36 = 1/3. Yep, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as each die contributes an expected value of 1/6, so two dice contribute 2*(1/6) = 1/3. That's a quicker way, but it's good that both methods give the same result.\n\nI think I'm confident now that the expected number of 1's when rolling two dice is 1/3.\n</think>\n\nThe expected number of 1's when rolling two standard dice is calculated by considering each die's contribution. Each die has a 1/6 chance of showing a 1, so the expected value for each die is 1/6. Adding these together for two dice gives 2*(1/6) = 1/3.\n\n**Answer:** The expected number of 1's is \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{3}}.",
