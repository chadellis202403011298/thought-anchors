How many sides does the polygon have? Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this math problem here: A regular polygon has exterior angles each measuring 15 degrees. How many sides does the polygon have? Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. \n\nFirst, I remember that polygons have something to do with angles and sides, and regular polygons have all their sides and angles equal. So, in this case, each exterior angle is 15 degrees. I think I need to find out how many sides the polygon has based on that information.\n\nWait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact properties of polygons, but I recall that the sum of all exterior angles of any polygon is always the same. Let me try to remember what that sum is. I think it's 360 degrees. Yeah, that sounds right because if you walk around a polygon, you make a full circle, which is 360 degrees. So, each exterior angle adds up to 360 degrees in total for any polygon.\n\nOkay, so if each exterior angle is 15 degrees, and the total sum is 360 degrees, then the number of sides (or the number of angles, since it's regular) should be 360 divided by the measure of each exterior angle. So, that would be 360 divided by 15. Let me write that down:\n\nNumber of sides = 360\u00b0 / measure of each exterior angle.\n\nPlugging in the numbers, that's 360 divided by 15. Let me compute that. 15 times 24 is 360, right? Because 15 times 20 is 300, and 15 times 4 is 60, so 300 + 60 is 360. So, 360 divided by 15 is 24. \n\nWait, so does that mean the polygon has 24 sides? That seems like a lot, but I think it's correct. Let me double-check my reasoning. Each exterior angle is 15 degrees, and the sum of all exterior angles is 360 degrees. So, 15 times the number of sides equals 360. Therefore, the number of sides is 360 divided by 15, which is indeed 24. \n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. Another way to think about it is, how many 15-degree angles fit into 360 degrees? Since 15 times 24 is 360, it fits exactly 24 times. So, the polygon must have 24 sides. \n\nJust to make sure, maybe I can think of another example. Like, for a square, each exterior angle is 90 degrees, right? And 360 divided by 90 is 4, which is correct because a square has 4 sides. Similarly, for an equilateral triangle, each exterior angle is 120 degrees, and 360 divided by 120 is 3, which is correct. So, applying the same logic, 360 divided by 15 should give the number of sides, which is 24. \n\nI think that makes sense. So, the polygon must have 24 sides.\n</think>\n\nThe polygon has 24 sides.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to find the number of sides of a regular polygon where each exterior angle measures 15 degrees.\n\n2. **Recall the Property**: The sum of all exterior angles of any polygon is always 360 degrees.\n\n3. **Set Up the Equation**: Let \\( n \\) be the number of sides. Since each exterior angle is 15 degrees, we have:\n   \\[\n   n \\times 15^\\circ = 360^\\circ\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solve for \\( n \\)**:\n   \\[\n   n = \\frac{360^\\circ}{15^\\circ} = 24\n   \\]\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The polygon has 24 sides.\n\n**Final Answer**: The polygon has \\boxed{24} sides.",
