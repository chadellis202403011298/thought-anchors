Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the acute angle formed by the hands of a clock at 6:44. Hmm, I remember that clocks have hour and minute hands, and each moves at a certain rate. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I should figure out where each hand is at 6:44. Starting with the minute hand because that seems simpler. The minute hand moves around the clock based on minutes. Since there are 60 minutes on a clock, each minute represents a certain number of degrees. Wait, how many degrees is each minute?\n\nI recall that a full circle is 360 degrees, and the clock is a circle, so each hour mark represents 30 degrees because 360 divided by 12 hours is 30. But for minutes, since there are 60 minutes, each minute would be 360 divided by 60, which is 6 degrees per minute. So, the minute hand moves 6 degrees every minute.\n\nAt 44 minutes past the hour, the minute hand would have moved 44 times 6 degrees. Let me calculate that: 44 * 6 = 264 degrees. So, the minute hand is at 264 degrees from the top (12 o'clock position).\n\nNow, onto the hour hand. The hour hand moves as the minutes pass, right? It's not exactly at the 6 anymore because it's 44 minutes past 6. So, I need to figure out how much the hour hand has moved from the 6 towards the 7.\n\nEach hour, the hour hand moves 30 degrees, as I thought earlier. But since it's moving continuously, each minute, the hour hand moves a fraction of that 30 degrees. Specifically, it moves 30 degrees per 60 minutes, which is 0.5 degrees per minute. So, every minute, the hour hand moves 0.5 degrees.\n\nAt 44 minutes past 6, the hour hand has moved 44 * 0.5 degrees. Let me compute that: 44 * 0.5 = 22 degrees. So, the hour hand is 22 degrees past the 6. Since each hour mark is 30 degrees apart, the 6 is at 180 degrees from 12 (because 6 * 30 = 180). Therefore, the hour hand is at 180 + 22 = 202 degrees.\n\nNow, I have both hands' positions: the minute hand at 264 degrees and the hour hand at 202 degrees. To find the angle between them, I subtract the smaller angle from the larger one: 264 - 202 = 62 degrees.\n\nWait, but the problem asks for the acute angle. Since a clock is a circle, the total degrees are 360, so the angle between the hands could be the smaller one or the larger one. If my calculation gives 62 degrees, that's already less than 180, so it's an acute angle. But just to be sure, I'll check if the other angle is 360 - 62 = 298 degrees, which is definitely obtuse, so 62 degrees is indeed the acute angle.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. For the minute hand: 44 * 6 = 264, that seems right. For the hour hand: 44 * 0.5 = 22, so 180 + 22 = 202, that also seems correct. The difference is 264 - 202 = 62 degrees. Yep, that's correct.\n\nI think I'm confident that the acute angle is 62 degrees. But just to make sure, let me visualize the clock. At 6:44, the minute hand is near the 8, which is 24 minutes (since each number is 5 minutes). Wait, no, 44 minutes is 44/5 = 8.8, so it's almost at the 9, which is 45 minutes. Hmm, but the exact position is 264 degrees, which is 264/30 = 8.8, so that's 8 and 4/5 of the way from 12 to 9, which is correct.\n\nThe hour hand at 6:44 is a bit past the 6. Since 44 minutes is almost an hour, the hour hand is almost at 7, but not quite. Each hour is 30 degrees, so 22 degrees past 6 would put it a little less than halfway towards 7, which seems about right.\n\nSo, the angle between them is 62 degrees, which is acute because it's less than 90 degrees. Wait, no, 62 is less than 90, so it's acute, but if the angle were, say, 100 degrees, then the acute angle would be 80 degrees, but in this case, 62 is already the smaller angle.\n\nWait, actually, I think I made a mistake here. The acute angle is the smaller angle between the two hands, regardless of where it is. So, if the angle is 62 degrees, that's acute because it's less than 90. But if it were, say, 120 degrees, the acute angle would be 240 degrees? No, wait, that doesn't make sense because 240 is still larger than 180. Wait, no, the acute angle is the smallest angle between the two hands, so if the angle is more than 180, we subtract it from 360 to get the acute angle.\n\nWait, in this case, 62 degrees is less than 180, so that's already the acute angle. If it were, say, 200 degrees, the acute angle would be 160 degrees because 360 - 200 = 160, which is still obtuse, so that's not the case here.\n\nWait, no, 160 is still obtuse because it's more than 90 degrees. So, the acute angle is the smallest angle, which is less than or equal to 180. So, in this case, 62 is already the acute angle because it's less than 180, and the other angle is 298, which is greater than 180, so 62 is the acute angle.\n\nI think I'm confident now. So, the number of degrees in the acute angle formed by the hands of the clock at 6:44 is 62 degrees.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me think of another way to calculate the angle. I've heard of a formula where you can calculate the angle between the hour and minute hands using the formula:\n\n|30H - 5.5M|\n\nWhere H is the hour and M is the minutes. Let me try that.\n\nAt 6:44, H = 6 and M = 44.\n\nSo, 30 * 6 = 180\n5.5 * 44 = let's calculate that: 5 * 44 = 220, and 0.5 * 44 = 22, so total is 220 + 22 = 242\n\nSo, |180 - 242| = |-62| = 62 degrees.\n\nThat's the same result as before. So, that confirms it. The angle is 62 degrees, which is acute.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the answer is 62 degrees.\n</think>\n\nThe acute angle formed by the hands of a clock at 6:44 is 62 degrees.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Calculate the position of the minute hand:**\n   - Each minute represents 6 degrees (360 degrees / 60 minutes).\n   - At 44 minutes: 44 * 6 = 264 degrees.\n\n2. **Calculate the position of the hour hand:**\n   - Each hour represents 30 degrees (360 degrees / 12 hours).\n   - The hour hand moves 0.5 degrees per minute (30 degrees / 60 minutes).\n   - At 44 minutes past 6: 44 * 0.5 = 22 degrees.\n   - Total position: 6 * 30 + 22 = 180 + 22 = 202 degrees.\n\n3. **Find the angle between the two hands:**\n   - Subtract the smaller angle from the larger: |264 - 202| = 62 degrees.\n\n4. **Determine the acute angle:**\n   - Since 62 degrees is less than 180 degrees, it is already the acute angle.\n\n**Answer:** The acute angle is \\boxed{62} degrees.",
