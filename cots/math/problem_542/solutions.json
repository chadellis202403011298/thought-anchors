Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I need to compute 26 multiplied by 33 plus 67 multiplied by 26. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that when you have multiplication and addition in an expression, you can sometimes factor out common terms to make the calculation easier. Let me see if that applies here.\n\nLooking at the problem, both terms have 26 as a factor. The first term is 26 times 33, and the second term is 67 times 26. So, I can factor out the 26 from both terms. That would leave me with 26 multiplied by the sum of 33 and 67. Let me write that down to visualize it better.\n\nSo, the original expression is 26\u00d733 + 67\u00d726. Factoring out 26, it becomes 26\u00d7(33 + 67). Now, I can compute the sum inside the parentheses first. Let me add 33 and 67 together. 33 plus 67... let's see, 30 plus 60 is 90, and 3 plus 7 is 10, so 90 plus 10 is 100. So, 33 + 67 equals 100. That simplifies things a lot!\n\nNow, the expression is 26\u00d7100. I know that multiplying any number by 100 is straightforward; you just add two zeros to the end of that number. So, 26 times 100 would be 2600. Let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 26 multiplied by 100 is indeed 2600 because 26\u00d710 is 260, and adding another zero makes it 2600.\n\nWait a second, just to be thorough, maybe I should compute each multiplication separately and then add them up to confirm that both methods give the same result. Let me try that.\n\nFirst, compute 26\u00d733. Let's break that down. 26 times 30 is 780, and 26 times 3 is 78. So, adding those together, 780 + 78 is 858. So, 26\u00d733 equals 858.\n\nNext, compute 67\u00d726. Hmm, 67 times 20 is 1340, and 67 times 6 is 402. Adding those together, 1340 + 402 is 1742. So, 67\u00d726 equals 1742.\n\nNow, add those two results together: 858 + 1742. Let me add 800 + 1700, which is 2500, and then 58 + 42, which is 100. So, 2500 + 100 equals 2600. That matches the result I got earlier when I factored out 26. So, both methods give the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nI think I'm confident that the correct answer is 2600. It's always good to check my work using different methods to ensure I didn't make any calculation errors. Factoring out the common term made the problem much simpler, but doing it the longer way by calculating each product separately also worked and confirmed the answer.\n\nJust to recap, the key steps were:\n1. Notice that both terms have a common factor of 26.\n2. Factor out 26 to simplify the expression.\n3. Add the remaining numbers (33 + 67) to get 100.\n4. Multiply 26 by 100 to get 2600.\n5. As a check, compute each multiplication separately and then add them to confirm the result.\n\nThis problem was a good exercise in applying factoring to simplify calculations. It's a useful strategy when dealing with multiplication and addition together, especially when a common factor exists. I should remember to look for such opportunities in the future to make my math work more efficient.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires computing \\(26 \\times 33 + 67 \\times 26\\). \n\nFirst, notice that both terms share a common factor of 26. Factoring this out gives:\n\n\\[\n26 \\times (33 + 67)\n\\]\n\nCalculating the sum inside the parentheses:\n\n\\[\n33 + 67 = 100\n\\]\n\nThus, the expression simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n26 \\times 100 = 2600\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{2600}",
