Problem: Let $N$ denote the number of $7$ digit positive integers have the property that their digits are in increasing order. Determine the remainder obtained when $N$ is divided by $1000$. (Repeated digits are allowed.)\n Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how many 7-digit positive integers have their digits in increasing order, and repeated digits are allowed. Then, I have to find the remainder when that number is divided by 1000. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the problem. A 7-digit number means it's a number from 1,000,000 to 9,999,999. Each digit has to be in increasing order, but digits can repeat. So, for example, a number like 1123456 would be valid because each digit is not decreasing, right? Wait, no, actually, the problem says digits are in increasing order. So, does that mean each digit has to be strictly greater than the previous one, or can they be equal?\n\nWait, the problem says \"increasing order\" and \"repeated digits are allowed.\" Hmm, actually, in mathematics, \"increasing\" can sometimes mean non-decreasing, which allows for equal consecutive elements. But sometimes, \"increasing\" is taken as strictly increasing. I need to clarify that.\n\nLooking back at the problem statement: \"their digits are in increasing order. (Repeated digits are allowed.)\" So, they explicitly mention that repeated digits are allowed, which suggests that \"increasing\" here means non-decreasing. So, digits can stay the same or increase, but not decrease. So, for example, 1123456 is valid, 1223456 is also valid, etc. But something like 1234566 would also be valid because each digit is not decreasing.\n\nOkay, so the problem is about counting the number of non-decreasing 7-digit numbers. So, each digit is greater than or equal to the previous one.\n\nNow, how do I count such numbers? I remember something about combinations with repetition. Let me recall. When we have to choose elements with repetition allowed, the number of ways is given by the combination formula C(n + k - 1, k), where n is the number of types of elements, and k is the number of choices.\n\nWait, let me think again. So, in this case, we're choosing 7 digits (since it's a 7-digit number), and each digit can be from 1 to 9, right? Because it's a 7-digit number, the first digit can't be zero. So, digits are from 1 to 9, and we can repeat them.\n\nBut wait, the digits can be from 1 to 9, but in non-decreasing order. So, the problem reduces to finding the number of non-decreasing sequences of length 7 where each term is an integer from 1 to 9.\n\nYes, that sounds right. So, in combinatorics, the number of non-decreasing sequences of length k where each element is chosen from a set of size n is equal to the number of combinations with repetition, which is C(n + k - 1, k). So, in this case, n would be 9 (digits 1 through 9) and k is 7 (the number of digits).\n\nSo, the number of such numbers is C(9 + 7 - 1, 7) = C(15,7). Let me compute that. C(15,7) is 15! / (7! * (15-7)!) = 15! / (7!8!) = (15\u00d714\u00d713\u00d712\u00d711\u00d710\u00d79) / (7\u00d76\u00d75\u00d74\u00d73\u00d72\u00d71). Let me compute this.\n\nFirst, compute the numerator: 15\u00d714\u00d713\u00d712\u00d711\u00d710\u00d79.\n\nLet me compute step by step:\n\n15 \u00d7 14 = 210\n\n210 \u00d7 13 = 2730\n\n2730 \u00d7 12 = 32760\n\n32760 \u00d7 11 = 360,360\n\n360,360 \u00d7 10 = 3,603,600\n\n3,603,600 \u00d7 9 = 32,432,400\n\nSo, the numerator is 32,432,400.\n\nNow, the denominator is 7! = 5040.\n\nSo, C(15,7) = 32,432,400 / 5040.\n\nLet me compute that division. 32,432,400 \u00f7 5040.\n\nFirst, let's simplify both numerator and denominator by dividing numerator and denominator by 10: 3,243,240 / 504.\n\nNow, let's see if 504 divides into 3,243,240.\n\nCompute 3,243,240 \u00f7 504.\n\nLet me try to simplify further. Let's divide numerator and denominator by 8:\n\n3,243,240 \u00f7 8 = 405,405\n\n504 \u00f7 8 = 63\n\nSo now, it's 405,405 \u00f7 63.\n\nCompute 405,405 \u00f7 63.\n\n63 \u00d7 6,000 = 378,000\n\nSubtract: 405,405 - 378,000 = 27,405\n\n63 \u00d7 400 = 25,200\n\nSubtract: 27,405 - 25,200 = 2,205\n\n63 \u00d7 35 = 2,205\n\nSo, total is 6,000 + 400 + 35 = 6,435.\n\nSo, C(15,7) is 6,435.\n\nWait, let me verify that because I might have made an error in the division.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute 504 \u00d7 6,435 and see if it equals 3,243,240.\n\nCompute 504 \u00d7 6,435:\n\nFirst, compute 500 \u00d7 6,435 = 3,217,500\n\nThen, 4 \u00d7 6,435 = 25,740\n\nAdd them together: 3,217,500 + 25,740 = 3,243,240. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, C(15,7) = 6,435.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. The problem is about 7-digit numbers, so the first digit cannot be zero. But in our model, digits are from 1 to 9, so we didn't include zero. So, is there a possibility that some of these combinations would include zero? No, because we're only choosing digits from 1 to 9, so all 7-digit numbers are valid, starting from 1,111,111 up to 9,999,999.\n\nTherefore, the total number N is 6,435. So, N = 6,435.\n\nBut the problem asks for the remainder when N is divided by 1000. So, 6,435 \u00f7 1000 is 6 with a remainder of 435.\n\nTherefore, the remainder is 435.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait, let me recompute C(15,7):\n\nC(15,7) = 15! / (7!8!) = (15\u00d714\u00d713\u00d712\u00d711\u00d710\u00d79) / (7\u00d76\u00d75\u00d74\u00d73\u00d72\u00d71)\n\nLet me compute numerator and denominator separately:\n\nNumerator: 15\u00d714=210, 210\u00d713=2730, 2730\u00d712=32,760, 32,760\u00d711=360,360, 360,360\u00d710=3,603,600, 3,603,600\u00d79=32,432,400.\n\nDenominator: 7\u00d76=42, 42\u00d75=210, 210\u00d74=840, 840\u00d73=2520, 2520\u00d72=5040, 5040\u00d71=5040.\n\nSo, 32,432,400 / 5040 = 6,435. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, N = 6,435. Then, 6,435 mod 1000 is 435.\n\nWait, just to be thorough, let me think about another way to model this problem to make sure that 6,435 is indeed the correct number.\n\nAnother approach: The number of non-decreasing 7-digit numbers is equivalent to the number of multisets of size 7 from a set of 9 elements (digits 1 through 9). The formula for multisets is indeed C(n + k -1, k), which in this case is C(15,7) = 6,435. So that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, we can model this as placing 7 indistinct balls into 9 distinct boxes, where each box represents a digit from 1 to 9, and the number of balls in each box represents how many times that digit appears. The number of ways to do this is C(15,7). So, that's another way to see it.\n\nSo, I think that's correct. Therefore, N is 6,435, and N mod 1000 is 435.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me check if there's another way to compute N.\n\nWait, another approach is to think of it as a stars and bars problem. We have 7 stars (digits) and 8 bars (to separate the 9 digits). The number of ways to arrange them is C(15,7). So, same result.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that N is 6,435, and when divided by 1000, the remainder is 435.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe remainder when \\( N \\) is divided by 1000 is \\boxed{435}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of 7-digit positive integers with digits in non-decreasing order (repeated digits allowed), we need to count the number of non-decreasing sequences of length 7 where each term is an integer from 1 to 9.
