Problem: Find all values of $x$ that satisfy \\[\\frac{x^2}{x+1} \\ge \\frac{2}{x-1} + \\frac{5}{4}.\\] Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I need to solve this inequality: \\(\\frac{x^2}{x+1} \\ge \\frac{2}{x-1} + \\frac{5}{4}\\). Hmm, it looks a bit complicated with fractions and variables in the denominators. Let me take it step by step.\n\nFirst, I should probably figure out the domain of this inequality because the denominators can't be zero. So, \\(x + 1 \\neq 0\\) which means \\(x \\neq -1\\), and \\(x - 1 \\neq 0\\) so \\(x \\neq 1\\). So, the domain is all real numbers except \\(x = -1\\) and \\(x = 1\\).\n\nNow, to solve the inequality, maybe I should bring all terms to one side so that I can have a single rational expression. Let me subtract \\(\\frac{2}{x - 1}\\) and \\(\\frac{5}{4}\\) from both sides:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x^2}{x+1} - \\frac{2}{x - 1} - \\frac{5}{4} \\ge 0\n\\]\n\nNow, I need to combine these fractions into a single expression. To do that, I'll find a common denominator. The denominators are \\(x + 1\\), \\(x - 1\\), and 4. So, the least common denominator (LCD) would be 4(x + 1)(x - 1). That seems right because 4 is the LCD for 4 and 1, and (x + 1)(x - 1) is the LCD for \\(x + 1\\) and \\(x - 1\\).\n\nLet me rewrite each term with this common denominator.\n\nStarting with \\(\\frac{x^2}{x + 1}\\):\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by 4(x - 1):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x^2 \\cdot 4(x - 1)}{(x + 1) \\cdot 4(x - 1)} = \\frac{4x^2(x - 1)}{4(x + 1)(x - 1)}\n\\]\n\nNext term: \\(-\\frac{2}{x - 1}\\):\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by 4(x + 1):\n\n\\[\n-\\frac{2 \\cdot 4(x + 1)}{(x - 1) \\cdot 4(x + 1)} = -\\frac{8(x + 1)}{4(x + 1)(x - 1)}\n\\]\n\nLast term: \\(-\\frac{5}{4}\\):\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by (x + 1)(x - 1):\n\n\\[\n-\\frac{5 \\cdot (x + 1)(x - 1)}{4 \\cdot (x + 1)(x - 1)} = -\\frac{5(x^2 - 1)}{4(x + 1)(x - 1)}\n\\]\n\nNow, combining all these terms over the common denominator:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4x^2(x - 1) - 8(x + 1) - 5(x^2 - 1)}{4(x + 1)(x - 1)} \\ge 0\n\\]\n\nLet me simplify the numerator step by step.\n\nFirst, expand \\(4x^2(x - 1)\\):\n\n\\[\n4x^2 \\cdot x - 4x^2 \\cdot 1 = 4x^3 - 4x^2\n\\]\n\nNext, expand \\(-8(x + 1)\\):\n\n\\[\n-8x - 8\n\\]\n\nThen, expand \\(-5(x^2 - 1)\\):\n\n\\[\n-5x^2 + 5\n\\]\n\nNow, combine all these terms:\n\n\\[\n4x^3 - 4x^2 - 8x - 8 - 5x^2 + 5\n\\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n- \\(4x^3\\) remains as is.\n- \\(-4x^2 - 5x^2 = -9x^2\\)\n- \\(-8x\\) remains as is.\n- \\(-8 + 5 = -3\\)\n\nSo, the numerator simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n4x^3 - 9x^2 - 8x - 3\n\\]\n\nSo now, the inequality is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{4x^3 - 9x^2 - 8x - 3}{4(x + 1)(x - 1)} \\ge 0\n\\]\n\nHmm, solving this inequality requires finding where the rational function is positive or zero. To do that, I need to find the zeros of the numerator and the denominator because these will be the critical points that divide the number line into intervals. I'll test each interval to see if the expression is positive or negative there.\n\nFirst, let's find the zeros of the numerator: \\(4x^3 - 9x^2 - 8x - 3 = 0\\). This is a cubic equation, which might be a bit tricky, but let's try to factor it.\n\nI can try rational root theorem. The possible rational roots are factors of the constant term divided by factors of the leading coefficient. So, possible roots are \u00b11, \u00b13, \u00b11/2, \u00b13/2, \u00b11/4, \u00b13/4.\n\nLet me test x = 1:\n\n\\(4(1)^3 - 9(1)^2 - 8(1) - 3 = 4 - 9 - 8 - 3 = -16\\), not zero.\n\nx = -1:\n\n\\(4(-1)^3 - 9(-1)^2 - 8(-1) - 3 = -4 - 9 + 8 - 3 = -8\\), not zero.\n\nx = 3:\n\n\\(4(27) - 9(9) - 8(3) - 3 = 108 - 81 - 24 - 3 = 0\\). Oh, x = 3 is a root.\n\nSo, (x - 3) is a factor. Let's perform polynomial division or use synthetic division to factor out (x - 3).\n\nUsing synthetic division:\n\nCoefficients: 4 | -9 | -8 | -3\n\nBring down 4.\n\nMultiply 4 by 3 = 12. Add to -9: 3.\n\nMultiply 3 by 3 = 9. Add to -8: 1.\n\nMultiply 1 by 3 = 3. Add to -3: 0. Perfect.\n\nSo, the cubic factors as (x - 3)(4x^2 + 3x + 1).\n\nNow, let's factor the quadratic: 4x^2 + 3x + 1.\n\nLooking for two numbers that multiply to 4*1 = 4 and add to 3. Hmm, 1 and 4? But 1 + 4 = 5, not 3. Maybe it doesn't factor nicely. Let me check the discriminant: \\(b^2 - 4ac = 9 - 16 = -7\\). Since discriminant is negative, the quadratic has no real roots. So, the numerator factors as (x - 3)(4x^2 + 3x + 1), and since the quadratic doesn't cross the x-axis, the only real root is x = 3.\n\nNow, zeros of the numerator: x = 3.\n\nZeros of the denominator: x = -1 and x = 1.\n\nSo, the critical points are x = -1, x = 1, and x = 3. These divide the real number line into four intervals:\n\n1. \\( (-\\infty, -1) \\)\n2. \\( (-1, 1) \\)\n3. \\( (1, 3) \\)\n4. \\( (3, \\infty) \\)\n\nI need to test each interval to see if the expression is positive or negative there.\n\nBut before that, let me note the behavior around the critical points:\n\n- At x = -1 and x = 1, the expression is undefined (denominator zero), so these points are excluded from the solution.\n\n- At x = 3, the numerator is zero, so the expression is zero, which satisfies the inequality (since it's \u2265 0).\n\nNow, let's test each interval.\n\n1. \\( (-\\infty, -1) \\)\n\nChoose a test point, say x = -2.\n\nPlug into numerator: 4*(-2)^3 - 9*(-2)^2 - 8*(-2) - 3 = 4*(-8) - 9*(4) + 16 - 3 = -32 - 36 + 16 - 3 = (-32 - 36) + (16 - 3) = -68 + 13 = -55.\n\nDenominator: 4*(-2 + 1)*(-2 - 1) = 4*(-1)*(-3) = 4*3 = 12.\n\nSo, the expression at x = -2 is -55/12, which is negative. So, this interval is negative.\n\n2. \\( (-1, 1) \\)\n\nChoose x = 0.\n\nNumerator: 4*(0)^3 - 9*(0)^2 - 8*(0) - 3 = -3.\n\nDenominator: 4*(0 + 1)*(0 - 1) = 4*(1)*(-1) = -4.\n\nSo, expression is (-3)/(-4) = 3/4, which is positive. So, this interval is positive.\n\n3. \\( (1, 3) \\)\n\nChoose x = 2.\n\nNumerator: 4*(8) - 9*(4) - 8*(2) - 3 = 32 - 36 - 16 - 3 = (32 - 36) + (-16 - 3) = -4 -19 = -23.\n\nDenominator: 4*(2 + 1)*(2 - 1) = 4*3*1 = 12.\n\nSo, expression is -23/12, which is negative. So, this interval is negative.\n\n4. \\( (3, \\infty) \\)\n\nChoose x = 4.\n\nNumerator: 4*(64) - 9*(16) - 8*(4) - 3 = 256 - 144 - 32 - 3 = (256 - 144) + (-32 - 3) = 112 - 35 = 77.\n\nDenominator: 4*(4 + 1)*(4 - 1) = 4*5*3 = 60.\n\nSo, expression is 77/60, which is positive. So, this interval is positive.\n\nNow, let's summarize:\n\n- \\( (-\\infty, -1) \\): Negative\n- \\( (-1, 1) \\): Positive\n- \\( (1, 3) \\): Negative\n- \\( (3, \\infty) \\): Positive\n\nSince we're looking for where the expression is \u2265 0, we include intervals where it's positive and points where it's zero.\n\nFrom above, the expression is positive in \\( (-1, 1) \\) and \\( (3, \\infty) \\). It is zero at x = 3.\n\nBut we have to exclude x = -1 and x = 1 because the function is undefined there.\n\nSo, the solution set is \\( (-1, 1) \\cup [3, \\infty) \\).\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Sometimes when dealing with rational functions, especially with cubic numerators, the behavior can be more complex. But in this case, the numerator only crosses zero at x = 3, and the denominator has vertical asymptotes at x = -1 and x = 1. The sign alternates between the intervals as we saw.\n\nLet me also check the behavior near the asymptotes.\n\nAs x approaches -1 from the left, denominator approaches 0 from the negative side (since x + 1 approaches 0 from negative, x - 1 approaches -2, so denominator is 4*(negative)*(negative) = positive, but near x = -1, x + 1 approaches 0 from negative, so denominator approaches 0 from positive? Wait, let me think.\n\nWait, denominator is 4(x + 1)(x - 1). So, near x = -1, x + 1 approaches 0 from negative (left side) and positive (right side). Let's see:\n\nAs x approaches -1 from the left (x \u2192 -1\u207b), x + 1 approaches 0 from negative, and x - 1 approaches -2, so denominator is 4*(negative)*(negative) = positive. So, denominator approaches 0 from positive.\n\nNumerator at x near -1: Let's plug x = -0.9:\n\n4*(-0.9)^3 -9*(-0.9)^2 -8*(-0.9) -3 \u2248 4*(-0.729) -9*(0.81) +7.2 -3 \u2248 -2.916 -7.29 +7.2 -3 \u2248 (-2.916 -7.29) + (7.2 -3) \u2248 -10.206 + 4.2 \u2248 -6.006. So, numerator is negative near x = -1 from the left.\n\nSo, near x = -1\u207b, expression is negative/positive ~ negative.\n\nAs x approaches -1 from the right (x \u2192 -1\u207a), x + 1 approaches 0 from positive, x - 1 approaches -2, so denominator is 4*(positive)*(negative) = negative. So, denominator approaches 0 from negative.\n\nNumerator at x near -1 from right: Let's take x = -0.1:\n\n4*(-0.1)^3 -9*(-0.1)^2 -8*(-0.1) -3 \u2248 4*(-0.001) -9*(0.01) +0.8 -3 \u2248 -0.004 -0.09 +0.8 -3 \u2248 (-0.004 -0.09) + (0.8 -3) \u2248 -0.094 -2.2 \u2248 -2.294. So, numerator is negative near x = -1 from right.\n\nSo, near x = -1\u207a, expression is negative/negative = positive.\n\nWait, but earlier when I tested x = 0, which is in (-1,1), the expression was positive, which matches. So, the expression goes from negative on the left of -1 to positive on the right of -1, which is consistent with our interval testing.\n\nSimilarly, near x = 1.\n\nAs x approaches 1 from the left (x \u2192 1\u207b), x - 1 approaches 0 from negative, x + 1 approaches 2, so denominator is 4*(2)*(negative) = negative. So, denominator approaches 0 from negative.\n\nNumerator at x near 1 from left: Let's take x = 0.9:\n\n4*(0.9)^3 -9*(0.9)^2 -8*(0.9) -3 \u2248 4*(0.729) -9*(0.81) -7.2 -3 \u2248 2.916 -7.29 -7.2 -3 \u2248 (2.916 -7.29) + (-7.2 -3) \u2248 -4.374 -10.2 \u2248 -14.574. So, numerator is negative.\n\nSo, near x = 1\u207b, expression is negative/negative = positive.\n\nWait, but when x approaches 1 from the right (x \u2192 1\u207a), x - 1 approaches 0 from positive, x + 1 approaches 2, so denominator is 4*(2)*(positive) = positive. So, denominator approaches 0 from positive.\n\nNumerator at x near 1 from right: x = 1.1:\n\n4*(1.331) -9*(1.21) -8*(1.1) -3 \u2248 5.324 -10.89 -8.8 -3 \u2248 (5.324 -10.89) + (-8.8 -3) \u2248 -5.566 -11.8 \u2248 -17.366. So, numerator is negative.\n\nSo, near x = 1\u207a, expression is negative/positive = negative.\n\nSo, the expression goes from positive on the left of 1 to negative on the right of 1, which matches our interval testing.\n\nNow, near x = 3, the expression is zero, so it's included in the solution.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the solution is where the expression is positive or zero: \\( (-1, 1) \\) and \\( [3, \\infty) \\).\n\nBut wait, let me check if I missed any other intervals where the expression could be positive. We saw that in \\( (-1,1) \\) it's positive, in \\( (3, \\infty) \\) it's positive, and at x=3 it's zero. So, that should be the complete solution.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me test a point in each interval again quickly.\n\n1. \\( (-\\infty, -1) \\): x = -2, negative. Correct.\n2. \\( (-1, 1) \\): x = 0, positive. Correct.\n3. \\( (1, 3) \\): x = 2, negative. Correct.\n4. \\( (3, \\infty) \\): x = 4, positive. Correct.\n\nSo, the expression is positive in \\( (-1,1) \\) and \\( (3, \\infty) \\), and zero at x = 3.\n\nTherefore, the solution is \\( (-1, 1) \\cup [3, \\infty) \\).\n\nBut wait, let me think about the original inequality: \\(\\frac{x^2}{x+1} \\ge \\frac{2}{x-1} + \\frac{5}{4}\\). When I moved everything to one side, I had to be careful about the direction of the inequality. But since I subtracted on both sides, the direction remains the same, so it's okay.\n\nAlso, when dealing with inequalities involving rational expressions, it's important to consider the sign changes around the critical points. We did that by testing intervals, so that should be fine.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. So, the final answer is \\( (-1, 1) \\cup [3, \\infty) \\).\n</think>\n\nThe solution to the inequality \\(\\frac{x^2}{x+1} \\ge \\frac{2}{x-1} + \\frac{5}{4}\\) is found by analyzing the sign of the rational function after combining all terms. The critical points are \\(x = -1\\), \\(x = 1\\), and \\(x = 3\\). Testing intervals around these points shows the expression is positive in \\((-1, 1)\\) and \\([3, \\infty)\\). Thus, the solution is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{(-1, 1) \\cup [3, \\infty)}\n\\]",
