Problem: Express the sum as a common fraction: $.1 + .02 + .003 + .0004 + .00005.$ Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I need to add these decimals: 0.1, 0.02, 0.003, 0.0004, and 0.00005. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I guess I can just line them up by their decimal points and add each column, but maybe there's a smarter way since each term seems to be getting smaller by a factor of 10 each time. Wait, let me check that.\n\nStarting with 0.1, then 0.02, which is 0.1 divided by 5, right? Because 0.1 is 1/10, and 0.02 is 2/100, which is 1/50. Hmm, maybe not exactly a factor of 10 each time. Let me check the next one: 0.003. That's 3/1000, and 0.0004 is 4/10000, and 0.00005 is 5/100000. Hmm, so each term after the first is increasing by 1 in the numerator and the denominator is increasing by a factor of 10 each time, starting from 10. So 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000.\n\nWait, maybe I can express each of these decimals as fractions and then add them up. Let me try that.\n\n0.1 is 1/10.\n\n0.02 is 2/100, which simplifies to 1/50.\n\n0.003 is 3/1000.\n\n0.0004 is 4/10000.\n\n0.00005 is 5/100000.\n\nSo now I have the fractions: 1/10, 1/50, 3/1000, 4/10000, 5/100000.\n\nI need to add all these together. To add fractions, I need a common denominator. The denominators here are 10, 50, 1000, 10000, 100000. The least common denominator (LCD) would be 100000 because each of the other denominators divides into 100000.\n\nLet me convert each fraction to have 100000 as the denominator.\n\n1/10: Multiply numerator and denominator by 10000 to get 10000/100000.\n\n1/50: Multiply numerator and denominator by 2000 to get 2000/100000.\n\n3/1000: Multiply numerator and denominator by 100 to get 300/100000.\n\n4/10000: Multiply numerator and denominator by 10 to get 40/100000.\n\n5/100000: It's already in terms of 100000, so it stays as 5/100000.\n\nNow, adding them all together:\n\n10000/100000 + 2000/100000 + 300/100000 + 40/100000 + 5/100000.\n\nLet me add the numerators step by step.\n\n10000 + 2000 = 12000.\n\n12000 + 300 = 12300.\n\n12300 + 40 = 12340.\n\n12340 + 5 = 12345.\n\nSo, the total is 12345/100000.\n\nNow, I can simplify this fraction. Let's see if 12345 and 100000 have a common factor.\n\nFirst, I can check if both are divisible by 5. 12345 ends with a 5, so yes, and 100000 ends with a 0, so yes.\n\nDividing numerator and denominator by 5:\n\n12345 \u00f7 5 = 2469.\n\n100000 \u00f7 5 = 20000.\n\nSo now, the fraction is 2469/20000.\n\nLet me check if 2469 and 20000 have any common factors. 2469 is an odd number, so not divisible by 2. Let's check 3: 2+4+6+9=21, which is divisible by 3, so 2469 \u00f7 3 = 823.\n\nWait, 3 times 823 is 2469. Now, checking 20000 \u00f7 3: 20000 divided by 3 is not an integer, so 3 is not a common factor.\n\nWait, but I thought 2469 \u00f7 3 is 823, but let me confirm that.\n\n3 \u00d7 800 = 2400.\n\n3 \u00d7 23 = 69.\n\nSo, 2400 + 69 = 2469. Yes, correct.\n\nSo, 2469 \u00f7 3 = 823, and 20000 \u00f7 3 is not an integer, so 3 is not a common factor. Let me check if 823 is a prime number.\n\nHmm, 823: Let's check divisibility by primes up to its square root. The square root of 823 is approximately 28.7, so I need to check primes up to 29.\n\nCheck 2: 823 is odd, so no.\n\n3: 8+2+3=13, not divisible by 3.\n\n5: Doesn't end with 0 or 5.\n\n7: 7\u00d7117=819, 823-819=4, so not divisible by 7.\n\n11: 11\u00d774=814, 823-814=9, not divisible by 11.\n\n13: 13\u00d763=819, 823-819=4, not divisible.\n\n17: 17\u00d748=816, 823-816=7, not divisible.\n\n19: 19\u00d743=817, 823-817=6, not divisible.\n\n23: 23\u00d735=805, 823-805=18, not divisible.\n\n29: 29\u00d728=812, 823-812=11, not divisible.\n\nSo, 823 is a prime number. Therefore, 2469/20000 simplifies to 823/20000/3? Wait, no, because when I divided by 3, I got 823/20000? Wait, no, that's not correct.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake here. Let me go back.\n\nAfter dividing numerator and denominator by 5, I had 2469/20000.\n\nThen, I checked if 2469 and 20000 have a common factor. I found that 2469 \u00f7 3 = 823, but 20000 \u00f7 3 is not an integer, so 3 is not a common factor. Therefore, the fraction 2469/20000 cannot be reduced further because 823 is a prime number, and 20000 doesn't have 823 as a factor.\n\nWait, but 2469 divided by 3 is 823, so 2469 = 3 \u00d7 823. Therefore, 2469/20000 = (3 \u00d7 823)/(20000). Since 20000 is 2^5 \u00d7 5^5, and 823 is a prime not present in the denominator, the fraction cannot be reduced further. Therefore, the simplified form is 2469/20000.\n\nWait, but let me check the addition again to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Because 0.1 + 0.02 is 0.12, plus 0.003 is 0.123, plus 0.0004 is 0.1234, plus 0.00005 is 0.12345. So as a decimal, the sum is 0.12345, which is 12345/100000, which simplifies to 2469/20000, as I found earlier. So that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Each term is n/(10^n) where n starts at 1 and goes to 5. So, the sum is 1/10 + 2/100 + 3/1000 + 4/10000 + 5/100000. But I don't know if that helps me find a formula or not, but since there are only five terms, adding them as I did before is straightforward.\n\nSo, to recap, I converted each decimal to a fraction, found a common denominator, added them up, simplified, and got 2469/20000. Let me just double-check that 2469/20000 is indeed 0.12345 when converted back to a decimal.\n\n20000 goes into 2469 how many times? 20000 \u00d7 0.12345 = 2469, right? Let me compute 20000 \u00d7 0.12345:\n\n0.1 \u00d7 20000 = 2000\n\n0.02 \u00d7 20000 = 400\n\n0.003 \u00d7 20000 = 60\n\n0.0004 \u00d7 20000 = 8\n\n0.00005 \u00d7 20000 = 1\n\nAdding those up: 2000 + 400 = 2400, +60 = 2460, +8 = 2468, +1 = 2469. Yes, that's correct. So, 2469/20000 is indeed 0.12345, which matches the sum of the decimals. Therefore, my final answer is 2469/20000.\n\nWait, but I just realized that 2469 and 20000 might have a common factor I missed. Let me check again. 2469 \u00f7 3 = 823, and 20000 \u00f7 3 is not an integer, so 3 isn't a common factor. 2469 is 3 \u00d7 823, and 823 is prime, so there are no other factors. Therefore, the fraction is indeed reduced completely to 2469/20000.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express it as a decimal and see if it can be simplified further, but 2469/20000 is already in its simplest form. So, I think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe sum expressed as a common fraction is \\boxed{\\dfrac{2469}{20000}}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem of expressing the sum \\(0.1 + 0.02 + 0.003 + 0.0004 + 0.00005\\) as a common fraction, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert each decimal to a fraction:**\n   - \\(0.1 = \\frac{1}{10}\\)\n   - \\(0.02 = \\frac{2}{100} = \\frac{1}{50}\\)\n   - \\(0.003 = \\frac{3}{1000}\\)\n   - \\(0.0004 = \\frac{4}{10000}\\)\n   - \\(0.00005 = \\frac{5}{100000}\\)\n\n2. **Find a common denominator:**\n   - The least common denominator (LCD) for 10, 50, 1000, 10000, and 100000 is 100000.\n\n3. **Convert each fraction to have the common denominator of 100000:**\n   - \\(\\frac{1}{10} = \\frac{10000}{100000}\\)\n   - \\(\\frac{1}{50} = \\frac{2000}{100000}\\)\n   - \\(\\frac{3}{1000} = \\frac{300}{100000}\\)\n   - \\(\\frac{4}{10000} = \\frac{40}{100000}\\)\n   - \\(\\frac{5}{100000} = \\frac{5}{100000}\\)\n\n4. **Add the fractions:**\n   - \\(\\frac{10000}{100000} + \\frac{2000}{100000} + \\frac{300}{100000} + \\frac{40}{100000} + \\frac{5}{100000} = \\frac{12345}{100000}\\)\n\n5. **Simplify the resulting fraction:**\n   - \\(\\frac{12345}{100000}\\) can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 5.\n   - \\(\\frac{12345 \u00f7 5}{100000 \u00f7 5} = \\frac{2469}{20000}\\)\n\n6. **Verify the simplified fraction:**\n   - Check if 2469 and 20000 have any common factors. Since 2469 is 3 \u00d7 823 (where 823 is a prime number) and 20000 is 2^5 \u00d7 5^5, there are no common factors other than 1.\n\nThus, the sum expressed as a common fraction is \\(\\boxed{\\dfrac{2469}{20000}}\\).",
