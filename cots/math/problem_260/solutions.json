Problem: Solve for $x$: $$ \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1}{x}.$$ Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this equation to solve: 1/2 minus 1/3 equals 1/x. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that when dealing with equations involving fractions, it's usually a good idea to find a common denominator to combine the fractions. But wait, in this case, I'm subtracting two fractions on the left side, and that's equal to 1/x. So maybe I should first compute what 1/2 minus 1/3 is and then set that equal to 1/x to solve for x.\n\nAlright, let me start by finding the difference between 1/2 and 1/3. To subtract these fractions, I need a common denominator. The denominators here are 2 and 3. The least common denominator for 2 and 3 is 6, I think. So I'll convert both fractions to have 6 as the denominator.\n\nFor 1/2, I multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 3, which gives me 3/6. For 1/3, I multiply numerator and denominator by 2, which gives me 2/6. Now, subtracting these: 3/6 minus 2/6. That should be straightforward. Subtracting the numerators gives me 3 minus 2, which is 1, and the denominator remains 6. So, 3/6 minus 2/6 equals 1/6.\n\nWait, so that means 1/2 minus 1/3 equals 1/6. So now, according to the original equation, 1/6 equals 1/x. So, 1/x is equal to 1/6. Hmm, so if 1/x equals 1/6, then x must be 6, right? Because if the reciprocal of x is 1/6, then x itself is 6.\n\nLet me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. First, I found the common denominator for 2 and 3, which is 6. Then I converted both fractions: 1/2 became 3/6 and 1/3 became 2/6. Subtracting them gave me 1/6. Setting that equal to 1/x, so 1/6 = 1/x, which implies x is 6. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about this problem in another way to confirm. If I have 1/2 minus 1/3, another approach is to use the formula for subtracting fractions: (a/b - c/d) = (ad - bc)/bd. So applying that here, a is 1, b is 2, c is 1, and d is 3. Plugging in, we get (1*3 - 1*2)/(2*3) = (3 - 2)/6 = 1/6. Yep, same result. So that's consistent.\n\nSo, 1/x equals 1/6, which means x is 6. Therefore, the solution is x equals 6. I don't think I made any mistakes here, but just to be thorough, let me plug x back into the original equation to verify. If x is 6, then the right side is 1/6. The left side is 1/2 minus 1/3, which we already calculated as 1/6. So 1/6 equals 1/6, which is true. That confirms that x = 6 is indeed the correct solution.\n\nWait, but let me think again: sometimes when dealing with reciprocals, especially in equations, there might be cases where you have to consider the possibility of negative solutions or other possibilities, but in this case, since both 1/2 and 1/3 are positive, their difference is positive, so 1/x must be positive, which means x must be positive as well. So x = 6 is the only valid solution here.\n\nI don't see any other steps I need to take. I think I've covered all the necessary parts. So, to recap: subtract the two fractions by finding a common denominator, simplify, set equal to 1/x, solve for x, and verify by plugging back in. Everything checks out. So, yeah, x is 6.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the equation \\(\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1}{x}\\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find a common denominator** for the fractions on the left side.
