What is the greatest number of quarters she could have? Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so Sasha has $3.20 in U.S. coins, and she has the same number of quarters and nickels. I need to find the greatest number of quarters she could have. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let me note down the information given. She has quarters and nickels, and the number of each is the same. So if she has 'n' quarters, she also has 'n' nickels. Now, I should probably consider other coins as well because the problem doesn't specify that she only has quarters and nickels. So, she might have dimes, pennies, or half-dollars too. But since the problem is asking for the greatest number of quarters, I should maximize the number of quarters while keeping the total amount at $3.20.\n\nWait, but I can't just assume she has only quarters and nickels. I need to account for other coins as well because that might affect the total amount. Hmm, maybe I should define variables for each type of coin she could have. Let me list the coins: pennies (1 cent), nickels (5 cents), dimes (10 cents), quarters (25 cents), half-dollars (50 cents), but I think half-dollars are less common, so maybe it's just up to quarters. Let me stick with pennies, nickels, dimes, and quarters for now.\n\nLet me define variables:\n- Let n = number of quarters = number of nickels (given)\n- Let d = number of dimes\n- Let p = number of pennies\n\nThe total amount in cents is 320 cents because $3.20 is 320 cents. So, the total value equation would be:\n\n25n (quarters) + 5n (nickels) + 10d (dimes) + p (pennies) = 320\n\nSimplify that: 25n + 5n = 30n, so:\n\n30n + 10d + p = 320\n\nNow, since we want to maximize the number of quarters, which is 'n', we should try to minimize the number of other coins, but we have to make sure that the total adds up to 320 cents. However, the other coins can't be negative, so d and p must be non-negative integers.\n\nWait, but the problem doesn't specify that she has other coins, so maybe she could have only quarters and nickels. Let me check that possibility first.\n\nIf she only has quarters and nickels, then d = 0 and p = 0. So the equation becomes:\n\n30n = 320\n\nBut 320 divided by 30 is approximately 10.666, which isn't an integer. So n can't be 10.666; it has to be an integer. So the maximum integer less than 10.666 is 10. Let me check: 30*10 = 300 cents, which is $3.00. But she has $3.20, so that leaves 20 cents unaccounted for. So that's not possible. Therefore, she must have other coins besides quarters and nickels.\n\nSo, she must have some combination of dimes and pennies to make up the remaining 20 cents when n=10. But wait, let me check if n=10 is possible.\n\nIf n=10, then quarters and nickels contribute 30*10=300 cents. So the remaining is 320-300=20 cents. This 20 cents can be made up with dimes and pennies. For example, 2 dimes and 0 pennies, or 1 dime and 10 pennies, or 0 dimes and 20 pennies. So yes, n=10 is possible.\n\nBut maybe we can have a higher n. Let's try n=11. Then 30*11=330, which is more than 320. So that's not possible. So n can't be 11. Therefore, the maximum possible n is 10.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. If she has n quarters and n nickels, that's 30n cents. The remaining amount is 320 - 30n cents, which must be made up by dimes and pennies. To maximize n, we need to minimize the remaining amount. But wait, actually, to maximize n, we can have the remaining amount as small as possible, but it has to be non-negative. So the maximum n is when 30n \u2264 320. So n \u2264 320/30 \u224810.666, so n=10 is the maximum integer value.\n\nWait, but let me check if n=10 is possible. As I did before, 30*10=300, so 320-300=20. So she needs 20 cents from dimes and pennies. That's possible, as I thought earlier.\n\nBut wait, maybe I can have a higher n if I consider that the remaining amount can be made up with dimes and pennies. Let me see. For example, if n=10, then 30*10=300, so 320-300=20. So 20 cents can be made with 2 dimes, or 1 dime and 10 pennies, etc. So yes, that's possible.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Since n can't be more than 10 because 30*11=330>320, so n=10 is the maximum.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's a way to have more than 10 quarters by adjusting the other coins. For example, if I have n=11 quarters and 11 nickels, that's 330 cents, which is 10 cents over. So that's not possible. So n=10 is indeed the maximum.\n\nBut wait, maybe I can have n=10 and then use other coins to make up the 20 cents. So that's fine.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem says she has the same number of quarters and nickels, but it doesn't say anything about other coins. So she could have other coins as well, but to maximize the number of quarters, we need to minimize the number of other coins. Wait, no, actually, to maximize the number of quarters, we need to have as many quarters as possible without exceeding the total amount.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me consider that she has n quarters and n nickels, so 30n cents from those. The remaining amount is 320 - 30n, which must be made up by dimes and pennies. To have the remaining amount as small as possible, we can have the maximum number of quarters, but since 30n must be less than or equal to 320, n can be at most 10, as 30*10=300 \u2264320, and 30*11=330>320.\n\nSo the maximum number of quarters is 10.\n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct. So with n=10, the total from quarters and nickels is 300 cents, and the remaining 20 cents can be made up with dimes and pennies. So that's possible.\n\nAlternatively, if n=9, then 30*9=270, leaving 50 cents. That can be made with 5 dimes, or 1 dime and 40 pennies, etc. But since we're trying to maximize n, 10 is better than 9.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose n=10, and the remaining 20 cents are made up with 2 dimes. Then the total coins would be 10 quarters, 10 nickels, and 2 dimes. That adds up to 10+10+2=22 coins. Alternatively, if n=10, and the remaining 20 cents are made up with 1 dime and 10 pennies, that's 10+10+1+10=31 coins. But the problem doesn't specify the number of coins, just the number of quarters.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The key point is that with n=10, the total from quarters and nickels is 300, and the remaining 20 can be made up with other coins, so n=10 is possible. Since n=11 would require 330 cents, which is more than 320, it's impossible. So the maximum number of quarters is 10.\n\nWait, but let me check another angle. Suppose she has n quarters and n nickels, and the rest in dimes and pennies. The total is 320 cents. So 30n + 10d + p = 320.\n\nWe can also think of this as 30n \u2264 320, so n \u2264 10.666, so n=10.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps she can have more quarters if she uses pennies to make up the difference. Wait, but pennies are 1 cent each, so adding more pennies would require more coins but wouldn't allow more quarters because the total amount is fixed.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me try n=10 again. 10 quarters = 250 cents, 10 nickels = 50 cents, so total from those is 300 cents. The remaining 20 cents can be made with 2 dimes, or 1 dime and 10 pennies, or 20 pennies. So yes, that works.\n\nIf I try n=11, that's 11 quarters = 275 cents, 11 nickels = 55 cents, total from those is 330 cents, which is 10 cents over, so that's not possible.\n\nTherefore, the greatest number of quarters she could have is 10.\n\nWait, but let me make sure there's no other way to have more than 10 quarters. Suppose she has 11 quarters, which is 275 cents, and 11 nickels, which is 55 cents, totaling 330 cents, which is 10 cents over. So that's not possible. Therefore, 10 is indeed the maximum.\n\nI think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nSasha has $3.20 in U.S. coins, with the same number of quarters and nickels. To find the greatest number of quarters, we set up the equation considering quarters (n), nickels (n), dimes (d), and pennies (p):\n\n25n + 5n + 10d + p = 320 cents.\n\nSimplifying, we get 30n + 10d + p = 320. To maximize n, we minimize the remaining amount:\n\n30n \u2264 320 \u21d2 n \u2264 10.666, so n = 10.\n\nWith n=10, the remaining 20 cents can be made with dimes and pennies. Thus, the greatest number of quarters is 10.\n\n$\\boxed{10}$",
