Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this math problem here: \"How many different counting numbers will each leave a remainder of 5 when divided into 47?\" Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit confused, but I'll take it slow.\n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. It's asking for the number of different counting numbers (which are just positive integers) that, when you divide 47 by each of them, they all leave a remainder of 5. So, if I have a number, let's call it 'n', and I divide 47 by 'n', the remainder is 5. I need to find how many such 'n's exist.\n\nAlright, so let's recall some division concepts. When we divide a number by another, we can express it as:\n\nDividend = Divisor \u00d7 Quotient + Remainder\n\nIn this case, the dividend is 47, the remainder is 5, and the divisor is 'n'. So, plugging into the formula:\n\n47 = n \u00d7 q + 5\n\nHere, 'q' is the quotient, which is also an integer. Let me rearrange this equation to solve for 'n' or 'q'. If I subtract 5 from both sides, I get:\n\n47 - 5 = n \u00d7 q  \n42 = n \u00d7 q\n\nSo, now I see that 'n' multiplied by 'q' equals 42. This means that both 'n' and 'q' are positive integers that are factors of 42. But wait, there's more to consider. Since we're dealing with division and remainders, the divisor 'n' must be greater than the remainder. Because in division, the remainder must always be less than the divisor. So, in this case, the remainder is 5, which means 'n' must be greater than 5. Otherwise, the remainder would be less than 'n'.\n\nSo, to summarize, 'n' is a positive integer greater than 5, and 'n' is a factor of 42. Therefore, I need to find all the factors of 42 that are greater than 5.\n\nLet me list out all the factors of 42 first. To do that, I can start by factoring 42 into its prime factors. 42 is an even number, so it's divisible by 2. 42 \u00f7 2 = 21. Then, 21 is 3 \u00d7 7. So, the prime factors are 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 7. Now, to find all the factors, I can consider all possible products of these prime factors.\n\nThe factors of 42 are:\n1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, 42.\n\nWait, let me check that. Starting from 1:\n1 \u00d7 42 = 42\n2 \u00d7 21 = 42\n3 \u00d7 14 = 42\n6 \u00d7 7 = 42\nSo, yes, the factors are 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, 42.\n\nNow, from these factors, I need to pick those that are greater than 5 because the remainder must be less than the divisor. So, let's go through each factor:\n\n1: Not greater than 5.\n2: Not greater than 5.\n3: Not greater than 5.\n6: Greater than 5. So, 6 is a candidate.\n7: Greater than 5. 7 is a candidate.\n14: Greater than 5. 14 is a candidate.\n21: Greater than 5. 21 is a candidate.\n42: Greater than 5. 42 is a candidate.\n\nSo, the factors greater than 5 are 6, 7, 14, 21, 42. That's five numbers. Let me count them: 6, 7, 14, 21, 42. Yep, that's five different counting numbers.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each of these to make sure they actually do leave a remainder of 5 when dividing 47. It's possible I made a mistake in my reasoning, so let's verify.\n\nStarting with 6:\n47 \u00f7 6. Let's compute that. 6 \u00d7 7 = 42, which is less than 47. The next multiple would be 6 \u00d7 8 = 48, which is too big. So, the quotient is 7, and the remainder is 47 - 42 = 5. Perfect, that works.\n\nNext, 7:\n47 \u00f7 7. 7 \u00d7 6 = 42, and 7 \u00d7 7 = 49. So, the quotient is 6, and the remainder is 47 - 42 = 5. That's correct.\n\nNow, 14:\n47 \u00f7 14. 14 \u00d7 3 = 42, and 14 \u00d7 4 = 56, which is too big. So, the quotient is 3, and the remainder is 47 - 42 = 5. Good.\n\nNext, 21:\n47 \u00f7 21. 21 \u00d7 2 = 42, and 21 \u00d7 3 = 63. So, the quotient is 2, and the remainder is 5. That works.\n\nLastly, 42:\n47 \u00f7 42. 42 \u00d7 1 = 42, and 42 \u00d7 2 = 84. So, the quotient is 1, and the remainder is 47 - 42 = 5. Perfect.\n\nSo, all five numbers do indeed leave a remainder of 5 when dividing 47. Therefore, the answer should be 5 different counting numbers.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't miss any factors, let me think again. The factors of 42 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, 42. That's all of them, right? I don't think I missed any. Because 42 is 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 7, and all the combinations are covered in that list. So, yes, I think I got them all.\n\nAnother way to think about this problem is that the divisor 'n' must satisfy two conditions:\n1. n divides 42 exactly (since 47 - 5 = 42, so n must be a factor of 42).\n2. n must be greater than 5 (since the remainder is 5, which is less than n).\n\nTherefore, the number of such 'n's is equal to the number of factors of 42 that are greater than 5. As we've found, there are five such numbers.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and I've double-checked each factor to make sure they work. So, yeah, the answer should be 5 different counting numbers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many different counting numbers leave a remainder of 5 when dividing 47, we start with the equation:\n\n47 = n \u00d7 q + 5\n\nSubtracting 5 from both sides gives:\n\n42 = n \u00d7 q\n\nHere, 'n' must be a factor of 42 and greater than 5 (since the remainder must be less than the divisor). The factors of 42 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, and 42. The factors greater than 5 are 6, 7, 14, 21, and 42. Each of these numbers, when dividing 47, leaves a remainder of 5. \n\nThus, there are 5 such counting numbers.\n\n$\\boxed{5}$",
