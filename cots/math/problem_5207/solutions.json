When one farmer owes the other money, he pays the debt in pigs or goats, with ``change'' received in the form of goats or pigs as necessary. (For example, a $\\$390$ debt could be paid with two pigs, with one goat received in change.) What is the amount of the smallest positive debt that can be resolved in this way? Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this math problem here about two farmers who agree on the worth of pigs and goats. Pigs are \\$300 each, and goats are \\$210 each. When one farmer owes the other money, they settle the debt using pigs or goats, and if needed, they give or receive change in the form of these animals. The question is asking for the smallest positive debt that can be resolved in this way.\n\nHmm, let me think. So, the problem is about exchanging pigs and goats to pay off debts, and figuring out the smallest amount that can be settled. I remember something about this being related to the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers. The GCD is the largest number that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder, but in this case, we're looking for the smallest positive debt, which I think would be the same as the GCD of \\$300 and \\$210. But wait, let me make sure I'm not jumping to conclusions.\n\nFirst, let me recall what the GCD is. The GCD of two numbers is the largest number that can divide both of them exactly. But in this problem, we're dealing with debts that can be settled using pigs and goats, which suggests that we're dealing with linear combinations of 300 and 210. So, maybe the smallest positive debt is actually the smallest positive integer that can be expressed as 300x + 210y, where x and y are integers (they can be positive or negative, representing giving or receiving change).\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the problem is essentially asking for the smallest positive integer that can be written as a linear combination of 300 and 210. And I remember from my math classes that the smallest such positive integer is indeed the GCD of the two numbers. So, the smallest positive debt would be GCD(300, 210).\n\nOkay, so let's compute the GCD of 300 and 210. To find the GCD, I can use the Euclidean algorithm. The Euclidean algorithm works by repeatedly applying division to reduce the problem into smaller parts.\n\nLet me write down the steps:\n\n1. Divide 300 by 210. The quotient is 1, and the remainder is 90, because 210 times 1 is 210, and 300 minus 210 is 90.\n2. Now, take 210 and divide it by the remainder from the previous step, which is 90. So, 210 divided by 90. The quotient is 2, because 90 times 2 is 180, and the remainder is 30, since 210 minus 180 is 30.\n3. Next, take 90 and divide it by the last remainder, which is 30. 90 divided by 30 is exactly 3 with no remainder.\n4. Since the last non-zero remainder is 30, the GCD of 300 and 210 is 30.\n\nSo, that means the smallest positive debt that can be resolved using pigs and goats is \\$30. Let me verify if that makes sense. If the GCD is 30, then any multiple of 30 can be expressed as a combination of 300 and 210. So, for example, 30 can be written as 300*1 + 210*(-1), because 300 minus 210 is 90, but wait, that's 90, not 30. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I need to find integers x and y such that 300x + 210y = 30. Let me try to find such x and y.\n\nLet me use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find x and y.\n\nFrom the Euclidean algorithm steps:\n\n300 = 210 * 1 + 90  \n210 = 90 * 2 + 30  \n90 = 30 * 3 + 0\n\nNow, working backwards:\n\n30 = 210 - 90 * 2  \nBut 90 is from the first equation: 90 = 300 - 210 * 1  \nSo, substitute that into the equation for 30:  \n30 = 210 - (300 - 210 * 1) * 2  \n= 210 - 300 * 2 + 210 * 2  \n= (210 + 210 * 2) - 300 * 2  \n= 210 * 3 - 300 * 2\n\nSo, that gives us 30 = 210*3 + 300*(-2). So, x is -2 and y is 3.\n\nThis means that a debt of \\$30 can be paid by giving 3 goats and receiving 2 pigs as change. Wait, but in the problem statement, when you pay a debt, you can give the animal and receive change if necessary. So, if I'm the one paying, I might give 3 goats (3 * 210 = 630) and receive 2 pigs as change (2 * 300 = 600). So, the net debt paid would be 630 - 600 = 30. That makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, if I'm the one receiving the debt, I would give 2 pigs and receive 3 goats as change. Either way, the net debt is 30. So, that works.\n\nWait, but let me check if a smaller debt than 30 is possible. Suppose I try 15, which is half of 30. Is there a way to express 15 as a combination of 300 and 210?\n\nLet me see: 300x + 210y = 15. If such integers x and y exist, then 15 would be a possible debt. But since 300 and 210 are both multiples of 30, any linear combination of them will also be a multiple of 30. Therefore, 15, which is not a multiple of 30, cannot be expressed as such a combination. So, 30 is indeed the smallest positive debt.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing something. Let me try to see if 30 is the minimal. Let's think about the possible debts. Since 300 and 210 are both multiples of 30, any debt that's a multiple of 30 can be formed by adding or subtracting pigs and goats. But can you get a debt smaller than 30? For example, can you get 15?\n\nLet me try to solve 300x + 210y = 15. Let's see if such integers x and y exist.\n\nDivide both sides by 15: 20x + 14y = 1.\n\nNow, 20 and 14 have a GCD of 2, so 20x + 14y = 1 would require that 2 divides 1, which is impossible. Therefore, 15 cannot be expressed as a linear combination of 300 and 210. Similarly, any number not divisible by 30 can't be expressed as such a combination, so 30 is indeed the smallest positive debt.\n\nSo, to recap, the problem reduces to finding the GCD of 300 and 210, which is 30. Therefore, the smallest positive debt that can be resolved using pigs and goats is \\$30.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the answer should be 30.\n</think>\n\nThe smallest positive debt that can be resolved using pigs and goats is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \\$300 and \\$210. Using the Euclidean algorithm, we find that GCD(300, 210) is 30. Therefore, the smallest positive debt is \\$30.\n\n$\\boxed{30}$",
