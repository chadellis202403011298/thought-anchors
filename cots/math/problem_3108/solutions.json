The question is asking for the ratio of the volume of the octahedron to the volume of the cube. The answer choices are given, so I'll need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nFirst, let me visualize the problem. A cube has six faces, and if we join the centers of adjoining faces, we'll get an octahedron inside the cube. Since it's a regular octahedron, all its edges should be equal, and all its faces should be equilateral triangles, I think. Hmm, but actually, wait, in a cube, the centers of adjoining faces are connected by lines that are equal in length, so maybe the octahedron is regular. I should confirm that.\n\nLet me start by assuming the cube has a side length of 'a'. It might be easier to work with specific numbers, so perhaps I can let the side length of the cube be 2 units. That way, the centers of the faces will be at 1 unit from each edge, which might simplify calculations. Alternatively, maybe keeping it as 'a' is better for generality. Let me think.\n\nIf I let the cube have side length 'a', then the centers of each face are at a distance of 'a/2' from each adjacent edge. So, for example, the center of the front face is at (a/2, a/2, a/2) if the cube is centered at the origin. Wait, no, actually, if the cube is from (0,0,0) to (a,a,a), then the centers of the faces would be at (a/2, a/2, 0) for the front face, (a/2, a/2, a) for the back face, and similarly for the others.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"adjoining faces,\" so each face is adjacent to four others, right? So, the centers of adjoining faces are connected, forming the edges of the octahedron. So, each edge of the octahedron connects the centers of two adjacent cube faces.\n\nLet me try to figure out the edge length of the octahedron. Since the centers are separated by a distance, I can compute that distance. For example, the distance between the centers of the front face (a/2, a/2, 0) and the right face (a, a/2, a/2). Wait, no, the right face center would be at (a, a/2, a/2), right? Because the right face is at x = a, so the center is at (a, a/2, a/2). Similarly, the front face center is at (a/2, a/2, 0). So, the distance between these two points is sqrt[(a - a/2)^2 + (a/2 - a/2)^2 + (a/2 - 0)^2] = sqrt[(a/2)^2 + 0 + (a/2)^2] = sqrt[(a^2)/4 + (a^2)/4] = sqrt(a^2/2) = a/\u221a2.\n\nWait, so each edge of the octahedron is a/\u221a2. Since the octahedron is regular, all edges are equal, so that's good.\n\nNow, I need to find the volume of the regular octahedron. I remember that the formula for the volume of a regular octahedron with edge length 'b' is (sqrt(2)/3) * b^3. So, substituting b = a/\u221a2, the volume V_octa would be (sqrt(2)/3) * (a/\u221a2)^3.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n(a/\u221a2)^3 = a^3 / (sqrt(2))^3 = a^3 / (2 * sqrt(2)).\n\nSo, V_octa = (sqrt(2)/3) * (a^3 / (2 * sqrt(2))) = (sqrt(2) * a^3) / (3 * 2 * sqrt(2))).\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator: sqrt(2) cancels out, so we have a^3 / (6).\n\nTherefore, V_octa = a^3 / 6.\n\nWait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check if I applied the formula correctly. The volume formula for a regular octahedron is indeed (sqrt(2)/3) * edge length cubed. So, with edge length a/\u221a2, plugging that in, it's (sqrt(2)/3) * (a/\u221a2)^3.\n\nLet me compute (a/\u221a2)^3 again: that's a^3 divided by (sqrt(2))^3, which is a^3 divided by (2 * sqrt(2)), correct. Then, multiplying by sqrt(2)/3, we get:\n\nsqrt(2) * a^3 / (3 * 2 * sqrt(2)) = (sqrt(2) cancels) a^3 / 6. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, the volume of the cube is a^3, since it's side length 'a'.\n\nSo, the ratio of the octahedron's volume to the cube's volume is (a^3 / 6) / a^3 = 1/6.\n\nWait, that's one of the answer choices, choice C: 1/6.\n\nHmm, that seems too easy. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach this differently, perhaps by decomposing the octahedron into simpler components whose volumes I can calculate.\n\nAnother way to think about the octahedron inside the cube is that it can be divided into two square pyramids, each with a square base that's a face of the cube and four triangular faces. Wait, no, actually, in a cube, the octahedron formed by connecting the centers of the faces would have each vertex at the center of a cube face, so each pyramid would have a square base at the center of the cube.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me visualize this: the octahedron inside the cube would have its vertices at the centers of each face of the cube. So, for a cube centered at the origin with side length 'a', the centers would be at (\u00b1a/2, 0, 0), (0, \u00b1a/2, 0), and (0, 0, \u00b1a/2). So, the octahedron has six vertices, each at the centers of the cube's faces.\n\nWait, so perhaps the octahedron can be considered as two square pyramids glued together at their square bases. Each pyramid would have a square base lying in, say, the xy-plane, centered at the origin, with vertices at (a/2, 0, 0), (-a/2, 0, 0), (0, a/2, 0), and (0, -a/2, 0), and the apex at (0, 0, a/2). Similarly, the other pyramid would have its apex at (0, 0, -a/2).\n\nSo, each pyramid has a square base with side length equal to the distance between (a/2, 0, 0) and (0, a/2, 0), which is sqrt[(a/2)^2 + (a/2)^2] = sqrt(a^2/4 + a^2/4) = sqrt(a^2/2) = a/\u221a2. Wait, no, that's the diagonal of the base square. Wait, no, the base is a square lying in the xy-plane with side length equal to the distance between adjacent vertices, which would be from (a/2, 0, 0) to (0, a/2, 0), which is a diagonal of the square face. Wait, no, that's not correct.\n\nWait, no, in reality, the base of each pyramid is a square with vertices at (a/2, 0, 0), (0, a/2, 0), (-a/2, 0, 0), and (0, -a/2, 0). Wait, but that's actually a square rotated 45 degrees relative to the cube's faces. So, the side length of this square is the distance between (a/2, 0, 0) and (0, a/2, 0), which is a/\u221a2, as I computed earlier. So, the base is a square with side length a/\u221a2.\n\nWait, but the area of the base would then be (a/\u221a2)^2 = a^2 / 2.\n\nThe height of each pyramid is the distance from the base to the apex. Since the apex is at (0, 0, a/2), and the base is in the plane z=0, the height is a/2.\n\nSo, the volume of each pyramid is (1/3) * base area * height = (1/3) * (a^2 / 2) * (a/2) = (1/3) * (a^3 / 4) = a^3 / 12.\n\nSince there are two such pyramids in the octahedron, the total volume of the octahedron is 2 * (a^3 / 12) = a^3 / 6, which matches what I found earlier. So, that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, the volume ratio is (a^3 / 6) / a^3 = 1/6, which is option C.\n\nWait, but let me check if I'm not making a mistake in visualizing the pyramids. The octahedron formed by connecting the centers of the cube's faces is indeed a regular octahedron, right? Because all edges are equal, as we saw earlier, each edge being a/\u221a2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the volume using another method, such as using coordinates and the formula for the volume of a polyhedron.\n\nLet me consider the cube with side length 'a', centered at the origin, so its vertices are at (\u00b1a/2, \u00b1a/2, \u00b1a/2). The centers of its faces are then at (a/2, 0, 0), (-a/2, 0, 0), (0, a/2, 0), (0, -a/2, 0), (0, 0, a/2), and (0, 0, -a/2). So, the octahedron has these six points as its vertices.\n\nTo find the volume of this octahedron, perhaps I can use the formula for the volume of a polyhedron given its vertices. Alternatively, I can use the fact that it's a regular octahedron and apply the volume formula.\n\nWait, the regular octahedron can be considered as two square pyramids glued together at their square bases. Each pyramid has a square base with side length s and height h. In this case, the base of each pyramid is a square lying in the plane z=0, with vertices at (a/2, 0, 0), (0, a/2, 0), (-a/2, 0, 0), and (0, -a/2, 0). So, the side length of this square is the distance between (a/2, 0, 0) and (0, a/2, 0), which is sqrt[(a/2)^2 + (a/2)^2] = sqrt(a^2/4 + a^2/4) = sqrt(a^2/2) = a/\u221a2, as before.\n\nThe area of the base is then (a/\u221a2)^2 = a^2 / 2. The height of each pyramid is the distance from the base (z=0) to the apex at (0, 0, a/2), which is a/2.\n\nSo, the volume of each pyramid is (1/3) * base area * height = (1/3) * (a^2 / 2) * (a/2) = (1/3) * (a^3 / 4) = a^3 / 12.\n\nSince the octahedron is made up of two such pyramids, the total volume is 2 * (a^3 / 12) = a^3 / 6, which again gives the same result.\n\nSo, the volume ratio is (a^3 / 6) / a^3 = 1/6, so the answer is C.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me try another approach. Maybe using coordinates and determinants to compute the volume.\n\nLet me consider one of the pyramids, say the one with apex at (0, 0, a/2) and base vertices at (a/2, 0, 0), (0, a/2, 0), (-a/2, 0, 0), and (0, -a/2, 0). I can choose four points from the base to form a tetrahedron and compute its volume, then multiply by the number of such tetrahedrons in the pyramid.\n\nWait, but perhaps it's easier to use the formula for the volume of a regular octahedron. The formula is (sqrt(2)/3) * edge length^3. We found earlier that the edge length is a/\u221a2, so substituting that in, we get:\n\nVolume = (sqrt(2)/3) * (a/\u221a2)^3 = (sqrt(2)/3) * (a^3 / (2 * sqrt(2))) ) = (sqrt(2) * a^3) / (3 * 2 * sqrt(2)) ) = a^3 / 6.\n\nSame result again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think about the octahedron in terms of vectors and use the scalar triple product to compute the volume.\n\nLet me choose points for the octahedron: let's take the apex at (0, 0, a/2), and three adjacent vertices at (a/2, 0, 0), (0, a/2, 0), and (0, 0, -a/2). Wait, no, actually, the octahedron is formed by points (a/2, 0, 0), (-a/2, 0, 0), (0, a/2, 0), (0, -a/2, 0), (0, 0, a/2), and (0, 0, -a/2).\n\nWait, perhaps I can define vectors from the origin to these points and compute the volume using the determinant method. But since the octahedron is symmetric, maybe it's better to stick with the methods I've already used.\n\nWait, another approach: the octahedron can be seen as a bipyramid over a square base. So, the volume is 2 * (1/3) * base area * height, which again would be 2*(1/3)*(a^2/2)*(a/2) = a^3/6.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the Cayley-Menger determinant, but that might be overcomplicating things.\n\nI think I've checked this enough ways. The volume ratio is 1/6, which is option C. So, I'm confident that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{C}\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by considering a cube with side length \\( a \\).
