Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out what x is. Let me read it again carefully: \"If x is a positive multiple of 8 and x\u00b2 > 100, but x < 20, what is x?\" Hmm, okay. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that x is a positive multiple of 8. That means x can be 8, 16, 24, 32, and so on. But wait, the problem also says that x is less than 20. So I need to consider only the multiples of 8 that are less than 20. Let me list those out: 8, 16. Because 24 is 24, which is more than 20, so that's out. So possible x values are 8 and 16.\n\nNext, the problem states that x squared is greater than 100. So I need to check which of these possible x values satisfy that condition. Let's calculate x\u00b2 for each.\n\nStarting with x = 8: 8 squared is 64. Is 64 greater than 100? No, it's less. So 8 doesn't work because 64 is not more than 100.\n\nNow, let's check x = 16: 16 squared is 256. Is 256 greater than 100? Yes, it definitely is. So 16 satisfies the condition x\u00b2 > 100.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't miss any other multiples. The next multiple after 16 is 24, but as I thought earlier, 24 is greater than 20, so it's excluded. So the only possible x that fits all the conditions is 16.\n\nJust to double-check, let me summarize the conditions:\n\n1. x is a positive multiple of 8: So x can be 8, 16, 24, etc.\n2. x < 20: So x must be less than 20, which leaves us with 8 and 16.\n3. x\u00b2 > 100: So we need to square each of these and see if they're over 100.\n\nAs I calculated, 8\u00b2 = 64, which is less than 100, so 8 is out. 16\u00b2 = 256, which is way more than 100, so 16 works.\n\nI think that's it. There are no other multiples of 8 between 8 and 20, so 16 is the only number that fits all the given conditions.\n\nWait, just to make sure I'm not making a mistake, let me think if there's any other way to approach this. Maybe I can list all multiples of 8 up to 20 and then check their squares.\n\nMultiples of 8 up to 20: 8, 16, 24 (but 24 is over 20, so stop at 16). Now, checking their squares:\n\n- 8\u00b2 = 64\n- 16\u00b2 = 256\n\nSo only 16\u00b2 is greater than 100. Yep, that's correct. So x must be 16.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. It seems straightforward. So the answer is 16.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires finding a positive multiple of 8 that is less than 20 and whose square is greater than 100. The multiples of 8 under 20 are 8 and 16. Checking their squares, only 16\u00b2 = 256 exceeds 100. Therefore, x is 16.\n\n$\\boxed{16}$",
