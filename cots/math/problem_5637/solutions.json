The question is asking how many degrees are in the sum of the measures of these six angles. Hmm, interesting. I need to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I should probably visualize the figure. It's two triangles overlapping each other. The first triangle is drawn with points (3,8), (10,4), and (1,0), and the second triangle has points (7,8), (9,0), and (0,4). Each of these triangles has three angles labeled 1 to 6. So, each triangle contributes three angles, making six in total.\n\nNow, I know that the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees. That's a basic geometry fact. So, if I have two separate triangles, each with angles summing to 180 degrees, then the total sum for both triangles would be 180 + 180 = 360 degrees. But wait, in this case, the triangles are overlapping, so some angles might be overlapping or sharing points. Does that affect the total sum?\n\nLet me think. Each triangle is a separate entity, even if they intersect each other. The angles at the points where they intersect might be part of both triangles, but when considering the sum of all six labeled angles, I should consider each angle individually, regardless of overlap. So, angle 1 is part of the first triangle, angle 2 is part of the second triangle, and so on. Therefore, each triangle contributes three angles, each of which is counted separately in the sum.\n\nSo, if each triangle has a sum of 180 degrees, then two triangles would have a combined sum of 360 degrees. Therefore, the sum of all six angles labeled 1 through 6 should be 360 degrees.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing something. Sometimes, in overlapping figures, especially with intersecting lines, the angles around a point can add up to 360 degrees. But in this case, we're only considering the angles of the triangles themselves, not the angles formed by their intersection. Each labeled angle is a vertex of one of the triangles, so they should each be part of their respective triangle's angle sum.\n\nLet me try to break it down. The first triangle has angles 1, 3, and 5. The second triangle has angles 2, 4, and 6. So, the sum of angles 1, 3, and 5 is 180 degrees, and the sum of angles 2, 4, and 6 is also 180 degrees. Adding those together, 180 + 180 equals 360 degrees. So, the total sum of the six angles is 360 degrees.\n\nI don't think I'm overcomplicating this, but just to be thorough, let me consider if any of the angles are reflex angles or something else that might change the sum. Reflex angles are those greater than 180 degrees, but in the case of triangles, all interior angles are less than 180 degrees. So, each angle labeled is a regular interior angle of a triangle, so each is less than 180 degrees. Therefore, the sum should still hold.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider that each triangle, regardless of its orientation or overlap, will always have its three angles summing to 180 degrees. So, two triangles, even overlapping, would have a combined angle sum of 360 degrees.\n\nI guess I'm confident now that the sum of the six angles is 360 degrees. I don't see any reason to doubt that, as the overlapping doesn't affect the internal angles of each triangle individually. Each triangle's angles are counted separately, so adding them together gives the total.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves two overlapping triangles, each contributing three angles. Since the sum of the angles in a single triangle is always 180 degrees, two triangles will have a combined sum of 360 degrees. Therefore, the sum of the six labeled angles is 360 degrees.\n\n**Answer:** The sum of the measures of the six numbered angles is \\boxed{360} degrees.",
