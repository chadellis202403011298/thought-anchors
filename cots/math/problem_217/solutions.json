Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the value of f(f(f(f(f(f(-1)))))) where f(x) is defined as x squared minus 2x. Hmm, that's a lot of nested functions. I think I should start by understanding what f(x) does and then apply it step by step, six times in total, starting with -1.\n\nFirst, let me write down the function again to make sure I have it right: f(x) = x\u00b2 - 2x. So, for any input x, I square it and then subtract twice x. Got it.\n\nSince I'm dealing with multiple compositions, maybe I can compute each layer one by one. Let's start with the innermost function and work our way out. That means I'll start with f(-1), then take that result and plug it into f again, and so on, six times.\n\nLet me make a table or something to keep track of each step. Let's define f\u2081 as the first application, f\u2082 as the second, and so on up to f\u2086, which is the sixth.\n\nStarting with x\u2080 = -1.\n\nNow, compute f\u2081 = f(x\u2080) = f(-1).\n\nPlugging into f(x): (-1)\u00b2 - 2*(-1) = 1 + 2 = 3. So f\u2081 = 3.\n\nNext, compute f\u2082 = f(f\u2081) = f(3).\n\nUsing f(x) again: 3\u00b2 - 2*3 = 9 - 6 = 3. So f\u2082 = 3.\n\nWait, that's interesting. After the first application, we got 3, and applying f again to 3 gives us 3 again. So, does that mean that every subsequent application of f will just give 3? Let me check.\n\nCompute f\u2083 = f(f\u2082) = f(3). As before, 3\u00b2 - 2*3 = 9 - 6 = 3. Yep, same result.\n\nSo, if I keep applying f to 3, it'll always stay at 3. Therefore, from f\u2081 onwards, every time I apply f, it's 3. So f\u2081 = 3, f\u2082 = 3, f\u2083 = 3, f\u2084 = 3, f\u2085 = 3, and f\u2086 = 3.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through each step again, just to be thorough.\n\nStarting with x\u2080 = -1.\n\nf\u2081 = f(-1) = (-1)\u00b2 - 2*(-1) = 1 + 2 = 3. Correct.\n\nf\u2082 = f(3) = 3\u00b2 - 2*3 = 9 - 6 = 3. Correct.\n\nf\u2083 = f(3) = 3 again. So, yeah, from the second step onwards, it's just 3 every time.\n\nSo, after six applications, f\u2086 = 3.\n\nWait, but maybe I should check if there's a pattern or a cycle here. Let me see what happens if I apply f to other numbers. For example, if I take f(0) = 0\u00b2 - 2*0 = 0, so 0 is a fixed point. Similarly, f(2) = 4 - 4 = 0, so 2 maps to 0, which maps to 0. But in our case, we started at -1, which maps to 3, which maps to itself. So 3 is another fixed point.\n\nWait, is 3 a fixed point? Let me check: f(3) = 9 - 6 = 3. Yes, so 3 is indeed a fixed point. So once we reach 3, all subsequent applications will stay at 3.\n\nTherefore, after the first application, we reach 3, and all the rest just give 3. So, regardless of how many times we apply f after that, the result is 3.\n\nSo, for f\u2081, we have 3, and then f\u2082 through f\u2086 are all 3. Therefore, f(f(f(f(f(f(-1)))))) is 3.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any steps. Let me write out each step explicitly.\n\n1. f\u2081 = f(-1) = (-1)^2 - 2*(-1) = 1 + 2 = 3.\n\n2. f\u2082 = f(f\u2081) = f(3) = 3^2 - 2*3 = 9 - 6 = 3.\n\n3. f\u2083 = f(f\u2082) = f(3) = 3.\n\n4. f\u2084 = f(f\u2083) = f(3) = 3.\n\n5. f\u2085 = f(f\u2084) = f(3) = 3.\n\n6. f\u2086 = f(f\u2085) = f(3) = 3.\n\nYep, that's six applications, and each after the first gives 3. So, the final answer is 3.\n\nI think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations. So, the value of f(f(f(f(f(f(-1)))))) is 3.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we evaluate the function \\( f(x) = x^2 - 2x \\) six times starting with \\( x = -1 \\).\n\n1. **First application:**  \n   \\( f(-1) = (-1)^2 - 2(-1) = 1 + 2 = 3 \\).\n\n2. **Subsequent applications:**  \n   Since \\( f(3) = 3^2 - 2(3) = 9 - 6 = 3 \\), every further application of \\( f \\) to 3 yields 3.\n\nThus, after six applications, the result remains 3.\n\n**Answer:**  \n\\boxed{3}",
