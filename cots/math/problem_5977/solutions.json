Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how many two-digit prime numbers have a units digit of 7. Hmm, let's start by understanding what the question is asking. A two-digit number ranges from 10 to 99, right? And a prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. So, I need to list all the two-digit numbers that end with 7 and then check which of those are prime.\n\nFirst, let me list all two-digit numbers ending with 7. The units digit is 7, so the numbers would be 17, 27, 37, 47, 57, 67, 77, 87, and 97. Let me count them: 17, 27, 37, 47, 57, 67, 77, 87, 97. That's nine numbers in total. Now, I need to check each one to see if it's prime.\n\nStarting with 17: I know 17 is a prime number because its only divisors are 1 and 17. Let me confirm that. 17 divided by 2 is 8.5, so it's not divisible by 2. 17 divided by 3 is about 5.666, so not divisible by 3. The square root of 17 is about 4.123, so I only need to check primes up to 4. Next prime after 2 is 3, and we've done that. So, 17 is prime.\n\nNext is 27: Hmm, 27 is a number I remember isn't prime. Let me see, 27 divided by 3 is 9, so yes, it's divisible by 3. Therefore, 27 is not prime.\n\nMoving on to 37: I think 37 is prime. Let me check. Divided by 2? 37/2 is 18.5, so no. Divided by 3? 37/3 is about 12.333, so no. The square root of 37 is around 6.08, so I check primes up to 5. 5: 37/5 is 7.4, so no. So, 37 is prime.\n\nNext number is 47: Let me check if 47 is prime. Divided by 2? 23.5, so no. Divided by 3? 47/3 is about 15.666, so no. Square root is around 6.855, so check primes up to 5. 5: 47/5 is 9.4, so no. Therefore, 47 is prime.\n\nNow, 57: Hmm, I think 57 is not prime. Let me check. 57 divided by 3 is 19, so yes, it's divisible by 3. Therefore, 57 is not prime.\n\nNext is 67: I believe 67 is prime. Let me verify. Divided by 2? 33.5, so no. Divided by 3? 67/3 is about 22.333, so no. Square root is around 8.185, so I need to check primes up to 7. 5: 67/5 is 13.4, so no. 7: 67/7 is approximately 9.571, so no. Therefore, 67 is prime.\n\nThen we have 77: I know 77 is not prime because 7 times 11 is 77. So, 77 is divisible by 7 and 11, making it composite.\n\nNext is 87: Let me check if 87 is prime. Divided by 3: 87/3 is 29, so yes, it's divisible by 3. Therefore, 87 is not prime.\n\nFinally, 97: I think 97 is a prime number. Let me check. Divided by 2? 48.5, so no. Divided by 3? 97/3 is about 32.333, so no. Square root is around 9.849, so I need to check primes up to 7. 5: 97/5 is 19.4, so no. 7: 97/7 is approximately 13.857, so no. Therefore, 97 is prime.\n\nSo, from the list, the prime numbers are 17, 37, 47, 67, and 97. Let me count them: 17, 37, 47, 67, 97. That's five numbers in total.\n\nWait, did I miss any? Let me go through the list again. 17 is prime, 27 is not, 37 is prime, 47 is prime, 57 is not, 67 is prime, 77 is not, 87 is not, 97 is prime. So yes, five primes in total.\n\nI think that's all. So, the answer should be 5 two-digit prime numbers ending with 7.\n</think>\n\nThe two-digit numbers ending with 7 are 17, 27, 37, 47, 57, 67, 77, 87, and 97. Checking each for primality, we find that 17, 37, 47, 67, and 97 are prime. Therefore, there are 5 such numbers.\n\n**Answer:** The number of two-digit prime numbers with a units digit of 7 is \\boxed{5}.",
