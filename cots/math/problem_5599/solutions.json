Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this math problem to solve: Calculate \\((-1)^{47} + 2^{(3^3 + 4^2 - 6^2)}\\). Hmm, let me break it down step by step because I want to make sure I understand each part correctly.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the two main parts of this expression: \\((-1)^{47}\\) and \\(2^{(3^3 + 4^2 - 6^2)}\\). I'll solve each part separately and then add them together at the end.\n\nStarting with the first part, \\((-1)^{47}\\). I remember that when you raise -1 to an exponent, the result depends on whether the exponent is even or odd. If the exponent is even, the result is 1, and if it's odd, the result is -1. So, 47 is an odd number, which means \\((-1)^{47}\\) should be -1. That part seems straightforward.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: \\(2^{(3^3 + 4^2 - 6^2)}\\). This looks a bit more complicated because of the exponents and the operations inside the parentheses. I need to handle the operations inside the exponent first, following the order of operations, which is parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division, and addition and subtraction (PEMDAS).\n\nLet me write out the expression inside the exponent again: \\(3^3 + 4^2 - 6^2\\). I'll compute each term separately.\n\nStarting with \\(3^3\\), which is 3 multiplied by itself three times: 3 * 3 = 9, then 9 * 3 = 27. So, \\(3^3 = 27\\).\n\nNext, \\(4^2\\) is 4 multiplied by 4, which equals 16. So, \\(4^2 = 16\\).\n\nThen, \\(6^2\\) is 6 multiplied by 6, which is 36. So, \\(6^2 = 36\\).\n\nNow, I can substitute these back into the expression inside the exponent: 27 + 16 - 36. Let me compute this step by step.\n\nFirst, 27 + 16. Adding those together: 27 + 16 = 43.\n\nThen, subtract 36 from that result: 43 - 36 = 7.\n\nSo, the exponent simplifies to 7. Therefore, the second part of the original expression is \\(2^7\\).\n\nNow, I need to compute \\(2^7\\). I know that 2 raised to the 7th power is calculated as 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2. Let me compute that step by step:\n\n- \\(2^1 = 2\\)\n- \\(2^2 = 4\\)\n- \\(2^3 = 8\\)\n- \\(2^4 = 16\\)\n- \\(2^5 = 32\\)\n- \\(2^6 = 64\\)\n- \\(2^7 = 128\\)\n\nSo, \\(2^7 = 128\\).\n\nNow that I've computed both parts, I can go back to the original expression and add them together.\n\nThe first part was \\(-1\\), and the second part is \\(128\\). So, adding these together: \\(-1 + 128\\).\n\nHmm, let me make sure I do this correctly. When adding a negative and a positive number, it's like subtracting the smaller number from the larger one and keeping the sign of the larger number. Here, 128 is positive and larger than 1, so the result will be positive.\n\nSo, 128 - 1 = 127. Therefore, \\(-1 + 128 = 127\\).\n\nWait, let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make a mistake. If I have 128 apples and I owe someone 1 apple, I would have 127 apples left. Yep, that makes sense. So, the addition part checks out.\n\nJust to recap, the steps were:\n\n1. Compute \\((-1)^{47}\\): Since 47 is odd, the result is -1.\n2. Compute the exponent in the second term: \\(3^3 + 4^2 - 6^2\\).\n   - \\(3^3 = 27\\)\n   - \\(4^2 = 16\\)\n   - \\(6^2 = 36\\)\n   - Then, 27 + 16 = 43\n   - 43 - 36 = 7\n3. Compute \\(2^7 = 128\\).\n4. Add the two results: -1 + 128 = 127.\n\nI think that covers all the steps. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, so I'm confident that the final answer is 127.\n</think>\n\nThe problem is to calculate \\((-1)^{47} + 2^{(3^3 + 4^2 - 6^2)}\\).\n\n1. Compute \\((-1)^{47}\\):\n   - Since 47 is odd, \\((-1)^{47} = -1\\).\n\n2. Compute the exponent in the second term:\n   - \\(3^3 = 27\\)\n   - \\(4^2 = 16\\)\n   - \\(6^2 = 36\\)\n   - Sum inside the exponent: \\(27 + 16 - 36 = 7\\)\n\n3. Compute \\(2^7\\):\n   - \\(2^7 = 128\\)\n\n4. Add the results:\n   - \\(-1 + 128 = 127\\)\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{127}\\)",
