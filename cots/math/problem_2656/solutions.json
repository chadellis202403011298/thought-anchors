There are two congruent triangles, triangle ABC and triangle ACD. Both triangles are congruent, which means all their corresponding sides and angles are equal. The problem states that AB = AC = AD, and the angle BAC is 20 degrees. I need to find the measure of angle BDC.\n\nFirst, let me try to visualize the diagram. There's point A at the top, and points B, C, and D are arranged around it. Since AB, AC, and AD are all equal, point A is equidistant from points B, C, and D. That suggests that points B, C, and D lie on a circle centered at A with radius AB. So, triangle ABC and triangle ACD are both isosceles triangles because two of their sides are equal.\n\nGiven that angle BAC is 20 degrees, I can start by analyzing triangle ABC. Since AB = AC, triangle ABC is isosceles with base BC. In an isosceles triangle, the base angles are equal. Let me denote the base angles as angle ABC and angle ACB. The sum of the angles in any triangle is 180 degrees, so:\n\nangle BAC + angle ABC + angle ACB = 180\u00b0\n20\u00b0 + 2 * angle ABC = 180\u00b0\n2 * angle ABC = 160\u00b0\nangle ABC = 80\u00b0\n\nSo, both angle ABC and angle ACB are 80 degrees each.\n\nNow, since triangles ABC and ACD are congruent, all corresponding angles and sides are equal. That means angle BAC is equal to angle CAD. Wait, angle BAC is 20\u00b0, so angle CAD must also be 20\u00b0, right?\n\nBut wait, in triangle ACD, sides AC and AD are equal, so it's also an isosceles triangle with base CD. Therefore, the base angles, angle ACD and angle ADC, should be equal. Let me calculate those.\n\nIn triangle ACD, angle CAD is 20\u00b0, so:\n\nangle CAD + angle ACD + angle ADC = 180\u00b0\n20\u00b0 + 2 * angle ACD = 180\u00b0\n2 * angle ACD = 160\u00b0\nangle ACD = 80\u00b0\n\nSo, both angle ACD and angle ADC are 80 degrees each.\n\nNow, I need to find angle BDC. Let me think about how points B, D, and C are arranged. Since all three points B, C, and D are on the circle centered at A, the quadrilateral ABDC is cyclic because all its vertices lie on a circle. Wait, but is that true? Let me check.\n\nActually, in this case, points B, C, and D are on the circle with center A, but point A is the center, not on the circumference. So, quadrilateral ABDC isn't cyclic in the usual sense because point A is the center, not lying on the circumference. Hmm, maybe I should approach this differently.\n\nLet me consider triangle ADC. Since AC = AD, and angle CAD is 20\u00b0, as established earlier, the triangle is isosceles with AC = AD. So, points C and D are both on the circle centered at A, each at a distance of AC from A. Similarly, point B is also on this circle.\n\nI need to find angle BDC. Let's consider triangle BDC. To find angle BDC, I might need to find some relationships between the sides or angles in this triangle.\n\nWait, maybe I can use some properties of circles here. Since points B, C, and D are all on the circle centered at A, the arcs between them correspond to the angles at the center. The central angles for arcs BC, CD, and DB can be determined based on the given information.\n\nGiven that angle BAC is 20\u00b0, which is the central angle for arc BC. Similarly, angle CAD is 20\u00b0, which is the central angle for arc CD. Since AB = AC = AD, all these points are equally spaced around the circle? Wait, no, because angle BAC is 20\u00b0, and angle CAD is also 20\u00b0, but what about the angle between AB and AD?\n\nWait, if angle BAC is 20\u00b0, and angle CAD is 20\u00b0, then the angle between AB and AD would be angle BAD, which is angle BAC + angle CAD, so 20\u00b0 + 20\u00b0 = 40\u00b0. So, the central angles for arcs BC, CD, and DB are 20\u00b0, 20\u00b0, and 40\u00b0, respectively.\n\nWait, but the total central angles around point A should add up to 360\u00b0, so let's check:\n\narc BC: 20\u00b0, arc CD: 20\u00b0, and arc DB: 40\u00b0, so 20 + 20 + 40 = 80\u00b0, which is way less than 360\u00b0. That doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm miscounting the arcs.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the arcs are arranged. Let me think again. Points B, C, and D are on the circle centered at A, but their exact positions might not be equally spaced. The problem says that triangles ABC and ACD are congruent, so maybe the arcs BC and CD are both 20\u00b0, but then what about the rest?\n\nWait, if angle BAC is 20\u00b0, then the arc BC is 20\u00b0. Similarly, angle CAD is 20\u00b0, so the arc CD is 20\u00b0. That leaves the arc DB, which would be the remaining part of the circle. Since the total circle is 360\u00b0, and we have arc BC as 20\u00b0, arc CD as 20\u00b0, and the rest is arc DB.\n\nWait, but points B, C, and D are all on the circle, so the arcs between them should add up to 360\u00b0. But I think I'm confusing the central angles with the arcs. Let me clarify.\n\nIn a circle, the measure of an arc is equal to the measure of the central angle that subtends it. So, if angle BAC is 20\u00b0, then the arc BC is 20\u00b0, and similarly, angle CAD is 20\u00b0, so the arc CD is 20\u00b0. Then, the arc from D back to B would be 360\u00b0 minus the sum of arcs BC and CD, which is 360 - 20 - 20 = 320\u00b0. But that seems too large. Alternatively, maybe I'm considering the arcs in the wrong order.\n\nWait, perhaps the points are arranged such that moving from B to C to D around the circle covers 20\u00b0, 20\u00b0, and the remaining 320\u00b0, but that would place point D almost opposite to B, which doesn't seem right given the Asymptote code. Let me check the Asymptote code again.\n\nThe Asymptote code defines points as follows:\n- pA at (0,0)\n- pB as pA + dir(240)\n- pC as pA + dir(260)\n- pD as pA + dir(280)\n\ndir(theta) in Asymptote gives a point on the unit circle at angle theta degrees. So, 240\u00b0, 260\u00b0, and 280\u00b0. Let's plot these points approximately.\n\n- 240\u00b0 is in the third quadrant, 60\u00b0 below the negative x-axis.\n- 260\u00b0 is 20\u00b0 above the negative x-axis, so slightly towards the fourth quadrant.\n- 280\u00b0 is 80\u00b0 above the negative x-axis, moving towards the fourth quadrant.\n\nSo, points B, C, and D are all in the lower half of the circle, with B at 240\u00b0, C at 260\u00b0, and D at 280\u00b0. So, the order around the circle is B at 240\u00b0, then C at 260\u00b0, then D at 280\u00b0, and back to A at 0\u00b0, but that's not the case since A is the center.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the circle centered at A, and points B, C, D on the circumference at angles 240\u00b0, 260\u00b0, and 280\u00b0, respectively. So, the arc from B to C is 20\u00b0, from C to D is another 20\u00b0, and from D back to B would be 320\u00b0, but that seems too large. Alternatively, perhaps the arcs are measured the other way around, but that's unlikely because the points are placed in order.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me instead consider triangles ABC and ACD being congruent, with AB = AC = AD. So, triangle ABC is congruent to triangle ACD, meaning that all corresponding sides and angles are equal. So, angle BAC equals angle CAD, both 20\u00b0, as given.\n\nNow, in triangle ABC, since AB = AC, the base angles at B and C are each 80\u00b0, as I calculated earlier. Similarly, in triangle ACD, since AC = AD, the base angles at C and D are each 80\u00b0, so angle ACD = angle ADC = 80\u00b0.\n\nNow, I need to find angle BDC. Let's consider triangle BDC. Points B, D, and C are all on the circle centered at A. To find angle BDC, perhaps I can use the fact that in a circle, the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.\n\nWait, but point D is on the circle, so angle BDC would be an inscribed angle intercepting arc BC. But wait, the central angle for arc BC is 20\u00b0, as given by angle BAC. So, the inscribed angle intercepting the same arc BC would be half of that, which is 10\u00b0. But that doesn't seem right because angle BDC is at point D, which is another point on the circle.\n\nWait, no, angle BDC intercepts arc BC, but from point D's perspective. Wait, no, the inscribed angle depends on which arc it's intercepting. Let me think again.\n\nIn the circle centered at A, points B, C, D are on the circumference. The central angles for arcs BC and CD are both 20\u00b0, as given by angles BAC and CAD. So, the arc from B to C is 20\u00b0, and from C to D is another 20\u00b0, making the arc from B to D through C equal to 40\u00b0, and the remaining arc from D back to B would be 320\u00b0, but that's the major arc. However, when considering inscribed angles, we usually take the minor arc unless specified otherwise.\n\nSo, the inscribed angle at point D intercepting arc BC would be half of 20\u00b0, which is 10\u00b0, but that seems too small. Alternatively, maybe I'm looking at the wrong arc.\n\nWait, angle BDC is at point D, so it intercepts arc BC. But the measure of angle BDC would be half the measure of the arc that's opposite to it, which is arc BC. So, if arc BC is 20\u00b0, then angle BDC is 10\u00b0. But let me check if that makes sense with the triangle.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use the Law of Sines or Cosines in triangle BDC. But to do that, I'd need to know the lengths of the sides, which I don't have directly. However, since all sides from A are equal (AB = AC = AD), perhaps I can express the sides in terms of a common length, say r.\n\nLet me denote AB = AC = AD = r. Then, in triangle ABC, sides AB = AC = r, and BC can be found using the Law of Cosines:\n\nBC\u00b2 = AB\u00b2 + AC\u00b2 - 2 * AB * AC * cos(angle BAC)\nBC\u00b2 = r\u00b2 + r\u00b2 - 2 * r * r * cos(20\u00b0)\nBC\u00b2 = 2r\u00b2 - 2r\u00b2 cos(20\u00b0)\nBC = r * sqrt(2 - 2 cos(20\u00b0))\n\nSimilarly, in triangle ACD, sides AC = AD = r, so CD is equal to BC, as the triangles are congruent. So, CD = BC = r * sqrt(2 - 2 cos(20\u00b0)).\n\nNow, in triangle BDC, sides BD, DC, and BC. Wait, but I don't know BD yet. Alternatively, perhaps I can find angles in triangle BDC.\n\nWait, let's consider points B, D, and C on the circle. The central angles for arcs BC and CD are both 20\u00b0, so the arc from B to C is 20\u00b0, and from C to D is another 20\u00b0, making the arc from B to D through C equal to 40\u00b0, as I thought earlier. The arc from D back to B would then be 320\u00b0, but that's the major arc.\n\nNow, angle BDC is an inscribed angle that intercepts arc BC. The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. So, if arc BC is 20\u00b0, then angle BDC is 10\u00b0. But wait, that seems too small. Let me check again.\n\nWait, no, angle BDC is at point D, so it intercepts arc BC. So, the inscribed angle at D intercepting arc BC would indeed be half of 20\u00b0, which is 10\u00b0. But I feel like that's not correct because in the Asymptote diagram, point D is placed such that angle BDC might be larger.\n\nWait, maybe I'm miscalculating the intercepted arc. Alternatively, perhaps angle BDC intercepts a different arc. Let me think about the position of point D relative to points B and C.\n\nPoint D is located at 280\u00b0, which is 80\u00b0 clockwise from the positive x-axis. Point B is at 240\u00b0, so the arc from B to D is 40\u00b0, going clockwise. So, the minor arc BD is 40\u00b0, and the major arc BD is 320\u00b0. If angle BDC is an inscribed angle, it would intercept the arc opposite to it, which is arc BC. Wait, no, angle BDC is at point D, so the intercepted arc would be arc BC, which is 20\u00b0, making angle BDC 10\u00b0, as before.\n\nBut let me consider another approach. Since triangles ABC and ACD are congruent, and AB = AC = AD, perhaps there's a way to find some congruent triangles or equal angles elsewhere.\n\nWait, in triangle ABC, angle ABC is 80\u00b0, as I found earlier. Similarly, in triangle ACD, angle ACD is 80\u00b0, so angle ACB is 80\u00b0, and angle ACD is 80\u00b0, meaning that angle BCD is 80\u00b0. Wait, no, point D is another point, so maybe I can consider triangle BCD.\n\nWait, let me try to find angle BCD. Since angle ACB is 80\u00b0, and point D is another point on the circle, perhaps angle BCD is related.\n\nWait, maybe I can use the fact that angle BAC is 20\u00b0, and angle CAD is 20\u00b0, so the total angle at A between AB and AD is 40\u00b0, as I thought earlier. So, angle BAD is 40\u00b0, which is the central angle for arc BD.\n\nNow, in the circle, the measure of an inscribed angle intercepting arc BD would be half of 40\u00b0, which is 20\u00b0, but that's the angle at the circumference. However, angle BDC is at point D, so it intercepts arc BC, which is 20\u00b0, so angle BDC would be 10\u00b0, as I thought before.\n\nWait, but I'm getting conflicting intuitions here. Let me try to approach this differently.\n\nLet me consider triangle ABD. Since AB = AD = r, triangle ABD is also isosceles with AB = AD. The angle at A is angle BAD, which is 40\u00b0, as calculated earlier. Therefore, the base angles at B and D are equal. Let me calculate them.\n\nIn triangle ABD:\nangle BAD = 40\u00b0\nangles ABD and ADB are equal.\n\nSum of angles:\n40\u00b0 + 2 * angle ABD = 180\u00b0\n2 * angle ABD = 140\u00b0\nangle ABD = 70\u00b0\n\nSo, angle ABD is 70\u00b0, which is the angle at point B in triangle ABD.\n\nNow, in triangle ABC, angle ABC is 80\u00b0, as calculated earlier. So, at point B, we have angle ABC = 80\u00b0, and angle ABD = 70\u00b0. Therefore, the angle between BC and BD at point B is angle DBC = angle ABC - angle ABD = 80\u00b0 - 70\u00b0 = 10\u00b0.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, angle DBC is 10\u00b0. Now, let's consider triangle BDC. We have angle DBC = 10\u00b0, and we need to find angle BDC.\n\nWait, but I don't know angle BCD yet. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the Law of Sines in triangle BDC.\n\nBut first, let me see if I can find some relationships. Since triangles ABC and ACD are congruent, and AB = AC = AD, perhaps there are some congruent triangles or similar triangles involved.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that in triangle BDC, the sum of angles is 180\u00b0, so:\n\nangle BDC + angle DBC + angle BCD = 180\u00b0\n\nWe know angle DBC is 10\u00b0, so if we can find angle BCD, we can find angle BDC.\n\nWait, angle BCD is the same as angle ACB in triangle ABC, which is 80\u00b0, because point C is common to both triangles ABC and ACD, and angle ACB is 80\u00b0. But wait, no, angle BCD is at point C between points B and D. Hmm, perhaps I'm confusing the angles.\n\nWait, in triangle ABC, angle ACB is 80\u00b0, which is the angle at point C between points A and B. But angle BCD is the angle at point C between points B and D, which might be different.\n\nWait, perhaps I can find angle BCD by considering the triangle ACD. In triangle ACD, angle ACD is 80\u00b0, as calculated earlier. So, angle BCD is the same as angle ACD, which is 80\u00b0, because point D is on the circle, so lines AC and AD are equal, making angle ACD = angle ACB = 80\u00b0, but I'm not sure if that's accurate.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to use the Law of Sines in triangle BDC.\n\nIn triangle BDC, sides are BD, DC, and BC. We know DC = BC, as triangles ABC and ACD are congruent, so DC = BC. Let me denote DC = BC = x.\n\nWe also have BD, which we can find using triangle ABD. In triangle ABD, sides AB = AD = r, and angle BAD = 40\u00b0, so using the Law of Cosines:\n\nBD\u00b2 = AB\u00b2 + AD\u00b2 - 2 * AB * AD * cos(angle BAD)\nBD\u00b2 = r\u00b2 + r\u00b2 - 2 * r * r * cos(40\u00b0)\nBD\u00b2 = 2r\u00b2 - 2r\u00b2 cos(40\u00b0)\nBD = r * sqrt(2 - 2 cos(40\u00b0))\n\nSo, BD = r * sqrt(2 - 2 cos(40\u00b0)), and BC = r * sqrt(2 - 2 cos(20\u00b0)).\n\nNow, in triangle BDC, sides DC = BC = r * sqrt(2 - 2 cos(20\u00b0)), and BD = r * sqrt(2 - 2 cos(40\u00b0)). Let me denote these as:\n\nDC = BC = x\nBD = y\n\nSo, in triangle BDC, we have sides x, x, and y, with angles opposite to them as angle BDC, angle DBC, and angle BCD.\n\nWe can apply the Law of Sines:\n\nx / sin(angle BDC) = x / sin(angle DBC) = y / sin(angle BCD)\n\nBut we know angle DBC is 10\u00b0, as calculated earlier, so:\n\nx / sin(angle BDC) = x / sin(10\u00b0)\n\nThis implies that sin(angle BDC) = sin(10\u00b0), so angle BDC could be 10\u00b0 or 170\u00b0, but since it's a triangle, it must be less than 180\u00b0, and given the configuration, it's likely 10\u00b0, but let's check.\n\nAlternatively, since triangle BDC has two sides equal (DC = BC), it's an isosceles triangle with DC = BC, so angles opposite those sides are equal. Wait, but DC = BC, so angle BDC = angle BCD.\n\nWait, that can't be right because in triangle BDC, if DC = BC, then angles at D and C are equal, meaning angle BDC = angle BCD. But earlier, I thought angle BCD was 80\u00b0, but that might not be the case.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify. In triangle ABC, angle ACB is 80\u00b0, but in triangle BDC, angle BCD is different because it's the angle at point C between points B and D, not between points A and B.\n\nWait, perhaps I can find angle BCD by considering the sum of angles around point C.\n\nAt point C, we have angles ACB (80\u00b0), angle BCD, and perhaps another angle. Wait, but point C is connected to points A, B, and D. So, the angles at point C would be angle ACB (80\u00b0), angle BCD, and angle ACD (80\u00b0), but that might not add up correctly.\n\nWait, no, in triangle ACD, angle ACD is 80\u00b0, which is the angle at point C between points A and D. So, that angle is 80\u00b0, and angle BCD is the angle at point C between points B and D, which is different.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use the fact that the sum of angles around point C is 360\u00b0, but that's only if considering all angles around a point, but in this case, point C is part of two triangles, ABC and ACD, so maybe the angles at C in those triangles add up to something.\n\nWait, in triangle ABC, angle ACB is 80\u00b0, and in triangle ACD, angle ACD is 80\u00b0, so the total angle at point C would be angle ACB + angle ACD = 80\u00b0 + 80\u00b0 = 160\u00b0, which is less than 360\u00b0, so perhaps there's another angle at point C, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try a different approach. Since triangles ABC and ACD are congruent, and AB = AC = AD, perhaps points B, C, and D are arranged such that angle BDC is 30\u00b0, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, alternatively, perhaps I can construct point E such that triangle ABE is congruent to triangle ACD, but that might not help directly.\n\nWait, maybe I can use the fact that angle BAC is 20\u00b0, and angle CAD is 20\u00b0, so the total angle at A is 40\u00b0, as I thought earlier. Then, using the Law of Sines in triangle ABD, where AB = AD = r, and angle BAD = 40\u00b0, we found angle ABD = 70\u00b0, as before.\n\nNow, in triangle ABC, angle ABC is 80\u00b0, so angle DBC = angle ABC - angle ABD = 80\u00b0 - 70\u00b0 = 10\u00b0, as I calculated earlier.\n\nNow, in triangle BDC, we have angle DBC = 10\u00b0, and we need to find angle BDC. Let's denote angle BDC as \u03b8. Since triangle BDC has sides DC = BC, it's isosceles with DC = BC, so angles at D and C are equal. Wait, but if DC = BC, then angle BDC = angle BCD.\n\nWait, but earlier, I thought angle BCD was 80\u00b0, but that might not be correct because angle BCD is the angle at point C between points B and D, which isn't necessarily the same as angle ACB in triangle ABC.\n\nWait, perhaps I can find angle BCD by considering triangle ACD. In triangle ACD, angle ACD is 80\u00b0, which is the angle at point C between points A and D. So, the angle between AC and CD is 80\u00b0, which means that angle BCD is supplementary to angle ACB if points B and D are on opposite sides, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I can consider the straight line at point C. If angle ACB is 80\u00b0, and angle ACD is 80\u00b0, then the angle between CB and CD would be 180\u00b0 - 80\u00b0 - 80\u00b0 = 20\u00b0, but that might not be correct.\n\nWait, no, that's not necessarily the case because points B and D are on the circle, so their positions might not be aligned in a straight line with point C.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the Law of Sines in triangle BDC. We have sides DC = BC = x, and BD = y, with angles opposite to them as angle BDC = \u03b8, angle DBC = 10\u00b0, and angle BCD = \u03c6.\n\nSince DC = BC, triangle BDC is isosceles with angles at D and C equal, so \u03b8 = \u03c6. Therefore, the sum of angles in triangle BDC is:\n\n\u03b8 + \u03c6 + 10\u00b0 = 180\u00b0\n2\u03b8 + 10\u00b0 = 180\u00b0\n2\u03b8 = 170\u00b0\n\u03b8 = 85\u00b0\n\nWait, that can't be right because earlier I thought angle BDC was 10\u00b0, but now I'm getting 85\u00b0. There must be a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nWait, no, if DC = BC, then angles opposite those sides, which are angle BDC and angle BCD, are equal. So, angle BDC = angle BCD = \u03b8. Then, angle DBC is 10\u00b0, so:\n\n\u03b8 + \u03b8 + 10\u00b0 = 180\u00b0\n2\u03b8 = 170\u00b0\n\u03b8 = 85\u00b0\n\nSo, angle BDC is 85\u00b0, which seems more reasonable. But wait, earlier I thought angle BDC was 10\u00b0, but that was based on an incorrect assumption about the intercepted arc.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the intercepted arc earlier. Let me reconcile these two approaches.\n\nUsing the Law of Sines in triangle BDC, I found angle BDC = 85\u00b0, but using the circle properties, I thought it was 10\u00b0, which is a big discrepancy. So, I must have made a mistake in one of the approaches.\n\nWait, let me check the Law of Sines approach again. In triangle BDC, sides DC = BC, so it's isosceles, so angles at D and C are equal. Therefore, angle BDC = angle BCD. Let me denote both as \u03b8. Then, angle DBC is 10\u00b0, so:\n\n\u03b8 + \u03b8 + 10\u00b0 = 180\u00b0\n2\u03b8 = 170\u00b0\n\u03b8 = 85\u00b0\n\nSo, angle BDC is 85\u00b0, which seems correct based on this approach.\n\nWait, but earlier, using the circle properties, I thought angle BDC was 10\u00b0, which contradicts this. So, where did I go wrong?\n\nI think I confused the intercepted arc. Let me re-examine that.\n\nIn the circle centered at A, points B, C, D are on the circumference. The central angles for arcs BC and CD are both 20\u00b0, as given by angles BAC and CAD. Therefore, the arc from B to C is 20\u00b0, from C to D is another 20\u00b0, making the arc from B to D through C equal to 40\u00b0, and the remaining arc from D back to B is 320\u00b0, which is the major arc.\n\nNow, angle BDC is an inscribed angle that intercepts arc BC. The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. So, arc BC is 20\u00b0, so angle BDC should be 10\u00b0. But according to the Law of Sines approach, angle BDC is 85\u00b0, which is much larger.\n\nThis inconsistency suggests that I made a mistake in one of the approaches. Let me check the Law of Sines approach again.\n\nWait, in the Law of Sines approach, I assumed that DC = BC, making triangle BDC isosceles with angles at D and C equal. But is DC equal to BC?\n\nWait, in the problem statement, it's given that triangles ABC and ACD are congruent. So, triangle ABC is congruent to triangle ACD, which means that corresponding sides are equal. Therefore, side BC in triangle ABC corresponds to side CD in triangle ACD, so BC = CD. Therefore, DC = BC, which means triangle BDC is indeed isosceles with DC = BC, so angles at D and C are equal, leading to angle BDC = 85\u00b0.\n\nBut according to the circle properties, angle BDC should be 10\u00b0, so there must be a mistake in the circle approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the intercepted arc is not BC, but something else. Let me think again.\n\nAngle BDC is at point D, and it's formed by points B, D, and C. The intercepted arc for angle BDC would be the arc that doesn't contain point D, which is arc BC. So, the measure of angle BDC should be half the measure of arc BC, which is 20\u00b0, so angle BDC = 10\u00b0.\n\nBut this contradicts the Law of Sines approach, which gives angle BDC = 85\u00b0. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in assuming that DC = BC.\n\nWait, but if triangles ABC and ACD are congruent, then BC must equal CD, so DC = BC. Therefore, triangle BDC is isosceles with DC = BC, leading to angle BDC = 85\u00b0, which contradicts the circle approach.\n\nThis suggests that my initial assumption that DC = BC is incorrect, but since triangles ABC and ACD are congruent, their corresponding sides should be equal. Therefore, BC corresponds to CD, so BC = CD, meaning DC = BC.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that I'm considering the wrong arcs. Let me think again about the circle.\n\nIf points B, C, D are on the circle centered at A, with central angles for arcs BC and CD being 20\u00b0, then the arc from B to D through C is 40\u00b0, and the arc from D to B through the other side is 320\u00b0, which is the major arc.\n\nNow, angle BDC is an inscribed angle that intercepts the minor arc BC, which is 20\u00b0, so angle BDC should be 10\u00b0. But according to the Law of Sines approach, it's 85\u00b0, which is a problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm misapplying the circle properties because point D is not positioned as I thought. Let me try to sketch this mentally again.\n\nPoint A is at the center, and points B, C, D are on the circumference. The central angles are:\n\n- angle BAC = 20\u00b0, so arc BC is 20\u00b0\n- angle CAD = 20\u00b0, so arc CD is 20\u00b0\n- Therefore, the arc from B to D through C is 40\u00b0, and the remaining arc from D back to B is 320\u00b0, which is the major arc.\n\nNow, angle BDC is an inscribed angle that intercepts arc BC, which is 20\u00b0, so angle BDC = 10\u00b0.\n\nBut in the Law of Sines approach, I found angle BDC = 85\u00b0, which is inconsistent. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in that approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that DC = BC. Let me check that again.\n\nTriangles ABC and ACD are congruent. In triangle ABC, side BC is opposite angle BAC = 20\u00b0, and in triangle ACD, side CD is opposite angle CAD = 20\u00b0, so yes, BC = CD. Therefore, DC = BC, making triangle BDC isosceles with DC = BC, so angles at D and C are equal, leading to angle BDC = angle BCD.\n\nBut if angle BDC is 10\u00b0, as per the circle approach, then angle BCD would also be 10\u00b0, making angle DBC = 160\u00b0, which contradicts the earlier calculation where angle DBC was 10\u00b0.\n\nWait, that can't be right. There's a clear inconsistency here, so I must have made a mistake in one of the approaches.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that I'm considering the wrong triangle. Let me try to use the Law of Cosines in triangle BDC.\n\nIn triangle BDC, sides DC = BC = x, and BD = y.\n\nWe have from earlier:\n\nx = BC = r * sqrt(2 - 2 cos(20\u00b0))\ny = BD = r * sqrt(2 - 2 cos(40\u00b0))\n\nNow, applying the Law of Cosines to find angle BDC:\n\ncos(angle BDC) = (BD\u00b2 + DC\u00b2 - BC\u00b2) / (2 * BD * DC)\n\nBut since DC = BC = x, this simplifies to:\n\ncos(angle BDC) = (y\u00b2 + x\u00b2 - x\u00b2) / (2 * y * x) = y\u00b2 / (2 y x) = y / (2x)\n\nSo, cos(angle BDC) = y / (2x)\n\nNow, substituting the values of y and x:\n\ny = r * sqrt(2 - 2 cos40\u00b0)\nx = r * sqrt(2 - 2 cos20\u00b0)\n\nSo,\n\ncos(angle BDC) = [r * sqrt(2 - 2 cos40\u00b0)] / [2 * r * sqrt(2 - 2 cos20\u00b0)]\n= sqrt(2 - 2 cos40\u00b0) / [2 * sqrt(2 - 2 cos20\u00b0)]\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\n= sqrt(2(1 - cos40\u00b0)) / [2 * sqrt(2(1 - cos20\u00b0))]\n= sqrt(2) * sqrt(1 - cos40\u00b0) / [2 * sqrt(2) * sqrt(1 - cos20\u00b0)]\n= sqrt(1 - cos40\u00b0) / [2 * sqrt(1 - cos20\u00b0)]\n\nNow, using the identity 1 - cos\u03b8 = 2 sin\u00b2(\u03b8/2), we can write:\n\n= sqrt(2 sin\u00b220\u00b0) / [2 * sqrt(2 sin\u00b210\u00b0)]\n= sqrt(2) * sin20\u00b0 / [2 * sqrt(2) * sin10\u00b0]\n= sin20\u00b0 / (2 sin10\u00b0)\n\nUsing the double-angle identity, sin20\u00b0 = 2 sin10\u00b0 cos10\u00b0, so:\n\n= (2 sin10\u00b0 cos10\u00b0) / (2 sin10\u00b0)\n= cos10\u00b0\n\nTherefore, cos(angle BDC) = cos10\u00b0, which implies that angle BDC = 10\u00b0, as cos10\u00b0 is positive and angle BDC is acute.\n\nThis result aligns with the circle approach, so angle BDC is indeed 10\u00b0. Therefore, my earlier mistake in the Law of Sines approach was due to an incorrect assumption that triangle BDC is isosceles with DC = BC, but in reality, angle BDC is 10\u00b0, and angle BCD is 85\u00b0, which doesn't make sense because in triangle BDC, the sum of angles would be 10\u00b0 + 85\u00b0 + 10\u00b0 = 105\u00b0, which is less than 180\u00b0, so that can't be right.\n\nWait, no, that suggests that there's a mistake in the Law of Sines approach because the Law of Cosines approach, which is more reliable, gives angle BDC = 10\u00b0, consistent with the circle approach.\n\nTherefore, the correct measure of angle BDC is 10 degrees.\n</think>\n\nThe measure of angle BDC is 10 degrees.\n\n$\\boxed{10^\\circ}$",
