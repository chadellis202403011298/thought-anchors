Problem: Find all real numbers $x$ such that \\[3 \\le \\frac{x}{2x-5} < 8.\\](Give your answer in interval notation.) Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I need to solve this inequality: \\(3 \\le \\frac{x}{2x-5} < 8\\). Hmm, that looks a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let me remember how to handle inequalities involving fractions. I think the key is to consider the denominator and whether it's positive or negative because that affects the direction of the inequality when I multiply both sides.\n\nFirst, let me write down the inequality again to make sure I have it right: \\(3 \\le \\frac{x}{2x-5} < 8\\). So, it's a compound inequality, meaning both parts need to be true at the same time. I think I can split this into two separate inequalities: \\(3 \\le \\frac{x}{2x-5}\\) and \\(\\frac{x}{2x-5} < 8\\). Then, I can solve each part separately and find the intersection of the solutions since both conditions must hold.\n\nBut before I do that, I should note that the denominator \\(2x - 5\\) cannot be zero because division by zero is undefined. So, let me find where \\(2x - 5 = 0\\). Solving for x, I get \\(2x = 5\\), so \\(x = \\frac{5}{2}\\). Therefore, \\(x\\) cannot be \\(\\frac{5}{2}\\). I'll keep that in mind as I proceed.\n\nNow, let's tackle the first inequality: \\(3 \\le \\frac{x}{2x - 5}\\). I'll subtract 3 from both sides to get \\(0 \\le \\frac{x}{2x - 5} - 3\\). Let me combine these terms into a single fraction. To do that, I'll write 3 as \\(\\frac{3(2x - 5)}{2x - 5}\\) so that both terms have the same denominator. So, the expression becomes:\n\n\\(0 \\le \\frac{x - 3(2x - 5)}{2x - 5}\\)\n\nLet me simplify the numerator: \\(x - 6x + 15 = -5x + 15\\). So, the inequality is now:\n\n\\(0 \\le \\frac{-5x + 15}{2x - 5}\\)\n\nI can factor out a -5 from the numerator: \\(-5(x - 3)\\). So, the inequality becomes:\n\n\\(0 \\le \\frac{-5(x - 3)}{2x - 5}\\)\n\nHmm, this is a bit complicated. Maybe it's better to move all terms to one side and make it a single rational expression. Alternatively, I can consider the inequality \\(3 \\le \\frac{x}{2x - 5}\\) and solve it by considering cases where the denominator is positive or negative.\n\nLet me try that approach. So, for the inequality \\(3 \\le \\frac{x}{2x - 5}\\), I can write it as \\(\\frac{x}{2x - 5} - 3 \\ge 0\\). Let me combine these terms:\n\n\\(\\frac{x - 3(2x - 5)}{2x - 5} \\ge 0\\)\n\nSimplify the numerator: \\(x - 6x + 15 = -5x + 15\\), so:\n\n\\(\\frac{-5x + 15}{2x - 5} \\ge 0\\)\n\nI can factor out a -5 from the numerator: \\(-5(x - 3)\\). So,\n\n\\(\\frac{-5(x - 3)}{2x - 5} \\ge 0\\)\n\nHmm, I can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by -1 to make it easier, but I need to remember that multiplying by a negative number reverses the inequality sign. So,\n\n\\(\\frac{5(x - 3)}{2x - 5} \\le 0\\)\n\nOkay, that's better. So, now the inequality is \\(\\frac{5(x - 3)}{2x - 5} \\le 0\\). Since 5 is a positive constant, I can ignore it for the inequality's sign, so it's equivalent to \\(\\frac{x - 3}{2x - 5} \\le 0\\).\n\nNow, I need to find where this expression is less than or equal to zero. To do that, I'll find the critical points where the expression is zero or undefined. The numerator is zero when \\(x - 3 = 0\\), so \\(x = 3\\). The denominator is zero when \\(2x - 5 = 0\\), so \\(x = \\frac{5}{2}\\). These points divide the real number line into intervals where the expression may change its sign.\n\nThe intervals are:\n\n1. \\( (-\\infty, \\frac{5}{2}) \\)\n2. \\( (\\frac{5}{2}, 3) \\)\n3. \\( (3, \\infty) \\)\n\nI'll test each interval to determine the sign of the expression \\(\\frac{x - 3}{2x - 5}\\) in that interval.\n\n1. For \\(x < \\frac{5}{2}\\), let's pick \\(x = 2\\). Then, numerator \\(2 - 3 = -1\\), denominator \\(4 - 5 = -1\\). So, \\(\\frac{-1}{-1} = 1\\), which is positive. So, the expression is positive in this interval.\n\n2. For \\( \\frac{5}{2} < x < 3\\), let's pick \\(x = 2.5\\). Wait, \\(2.5\\) is \\(\\frac{5}{2}\\), so I need to pick a number just above \\(\\frac{5}{2}\\), say \\(x = 2.6\\). Then, numerator \\(2.6 - 3 = -0.4\\), denominator \\(5.2 - 5 = 0.2\\). So, \\(\\frac{-0.4}{0.2} = -2\\), which is negative. So, the expression is negative in this interval.\n\n3. For \\(x > 3\\), let's pick \\(x = 4\\). Then, numerator \\(4 - 3 = 1\\), denominator \\(8 - 5 = 3\\). So, \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\), which is positive.\n\nNow, we're looking for where the expression is less than or equal to zero, so that's where it's negative or zero. From the intervals, it's negative in \\( (\\frac{5}{2}, 3) \\). Also, we need to check the critical points.\n\nAt \\(x = 3\\), the expression is zero, which satisfies the inequality \\(\\le 0\\). At \\(x = \\frac{5}{2}\\), the expression is undefined, so we exclude it.\n\nSo, the solution to the first inequality \\(3 \\le \\frac{x}{2x - 5}\\) is \\(x \\in (\\frac{5}{2}, 3]\\).\n\nNow, let's solve the second inequality: \\(\\frac{x}{2x - 5} < 8\\). Again, I'll subtract 8 from both sides to get \\(\\frac{x}{2x - 5} - 8 < 0\\). Let me combine these terms into a single fraction by expressing 8 as \\(\\frac{8(2x - 5)}{2x - 5}\\):\n\n\\(\\frac{x - 8(2x - 5)}{2x - 5} < 0\\)\n\nSimplify the numerator: \\(x - 16x + 40 = -15x + 40\\). So, the inequality becomes:\n\n\\(\\frac{-15x + 40}{2x - 5} < 0\\)\n\nI can factor out a -5 from the numerator: \\(-5(3x - 8)\\). So,\n\n\\(\\frac{-5(3x - 8)}{2x - 5} < 0\\)\n\nAgain, I can multiply numerator and denominator by -1, remembering to reverse the inequality sign:\n\n\\(\\frac{5(3x - 8)}{2x - 5} > 0\\)\n\nSince 5 is positive, it doesn't affect the inequality sign, so we can write:\n\n\\(\\frac{3x - 8}{2x - 5} > 0\\)\n\nNow, I need to find where this expression is positive. The critical points are where the numerator or denominator is zero. So, numerator zero at \\(3x - 8 = 0\\), which is \\(x = \\frac{8}{3}\\), and denominator zero at \\(2x - 5 = 0\\), which is \\(x = \\frac{5}{2}\\).\n\nThese points divide the real number line into intervals:\n\n1. \\( (-\\infty, \\frac{5}{2}) \\)\n2. \\( (\\frac{5}{2}, \\frac{8}{3}) \\)\n3. \\( (\\frac{8}{3}, \\infty) \\)\n\nI'll test each interval.\n\n1. For \\(x < \\frac{5}{2}\\), let's pick \\(x = 2\\). Then, numerator \\(3*2 - 8 = 6 - 8 = -2\\), denominator \\(4 - 5 = -1\\). So, \\(\\frac{-2}{-1} = 2\\), which is positive. So, the expression is positive in this interval.\n\n2. For \\( \\frac{5}{2} < x < \\frac{8}{3}\\), let's pick \\(x = 2.6\\) (which is \\(\\frac{13}{5}\\), just to be precise). Then, numerator \\(3*2.6 - 8 = 7.8 - 8 = -0.2\\), denominator \\(5.2 - 5 = 0.2\\). So, \\(\\frac{-0.2}{0.2} = -1\\), which is negative. So, the expression is negative in this interval.\n\n3. For \\(x > \\frac{8}{3}\\), let's pick \\(x = 3\\). Then, numerator \\(9 - 8 = 1\\), denominator \\(6 - 5 = 1\\). So, \\(\\frac{1}{1} = 1\\), which is positive.\n\nSo, the expression \\(\\frac{3x - 8}{2x - 5}\\) is positive in intervals \\( (-\\infty, \\frac{5}{2}) \\) and \\( (\\frac{8}{3}, \\infty) \\). Since the inequality is \\(> 0\\), these are the intervals where it holds.\n\nBut we have to consider the critical points:\n\nAt \\(x = \\frac{5}{2}\\), the expression is undefined, so we exclude it.\n\nAt \\(x = \\frac{8}{3}\\), the expression is zero, but our inequality is strict (\\(< 0\\) originally, but after flipping, it's \\(> 0\\)), so we don't include \\(x = \\frac{8}{3}\\).\n\nTherefore, the solution to the second inequality \\(\\frac{x}{2x - 5} < 8\\) is \\(x \\in (-\\infty, \\frac{5}{2}) \\cup (\\frac{8}{3}, \\infty)\\).\n\nWait, hold on. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, after solving \\(\\frac{3x - 8}{2x - 5} > 0\\), I found that the expression is positive in \\( (-\\infty, \\frac{5}{2}) \\) and \\( (\\frac{8}{3}, \\infty) \\). So, that's correct because in the first interval, both numerator and denominator are negative, making the fraction positive, and in the third interval, both are positive, so it's positive again.\n\nNow, the original second inequality was \\(\\frac{x}{2x - 5} < 8\\), which after manipulation became \\(\\frac{3x - 8}{2x - 5} > 0\\). So, the solution is \\(x \\in (-\\infty, \\frac{5}{2}) \\cup (\\frac{8}{3}, \\infty)\\).\n\nBut wait, let me check if this is correct by plugging in a value from each interval.\n\nFor example, in \\( (-\\infty, \\frac{5}{2}) \\), let's take \\(x = 2\\). Then, \\(\\frac{2}{4 - 5} = \\frac{2}{-1} = -2\\), which is indeed less than 8. So, that interval is correct.\n\nIn \\( (\\frac{5}{2}, \\frac{8}{3}) \\), let's take \\(x = 2.6\\). Then, \\(\\frac{2.6}{5.2 - 5} = \\frac{2.6}{0.2} = 13\\), which is greater than 8, so it doesn't satisfy the original inequality, which is correct because that interval isn't included.\n\nIn \\( (\\frac{8}{3}, \\infty) \\), let's take \\(x = 3\\). Then, \\(\\frac{3}{6 - 5} = 3\\), which is less than 8, so that's correct because it's included in the solution.\n\nWait, no, hold on. If \\(x = 3\\), then \\(\\frac{3}{1} = 3\\), which is indeed less than 8, so it satisfies the second inequality. But from the transformed inequality, we have \\(x > \\frac{8}{3}\\) as part of the solution. Wait, but when I plug \\(x = 3\\), which is greater than \\(\\frac{8}{3}\\) (since \\(\\frac{8}{3} \\approx 2.6667\\)), I get 3, which is less than 8, so that's correct.\n\nWait, but when I plug \\(x = 4\\), which is greater than \\(\\frac{8}{3}\\), I get \\(\\frac{4}{8 - 5} = \\frac{4}{3} \\approx 1.333\\), which is less than 8, so it's correct. So, the solution for the second inequality is indeed \\(x \\in (-\\infty, \\frac{5}{2}) \\cup (\\frac{8}{3}, \\infty)\\).\n\nNow, I have the solutions to both inequalities:\n\n1. \\(3 \\le \\frac{x}{2x - 5}\\) gives \\(x \\in (\\frac{5}{2}, 3]\\).\n\n2. \\(\\frac{x}{2x - 5} < 8\\) gives \\(x \\in (-\\infty, \\frac{5}{2}) \\cup (\\frac{8}{3}, \\infty)\\).\n\nBut since both conditions must be true at the same time, I need to find the intersection of these two solution sets.\n\nSo, the first solution is \\( (\\frac{5}{2}, 3] \\), and the second solution is \\( (-\\infty, \\frac{5}{2}) \\cup (\\frac{8}{3}, \\infty) \\).\n\nThe intersection would be where both are true. So, let's see:\n\n- The first interval is \\( (\\frac{5}{2}, 3] \\).\n\n- The second solution includes \\( (-\\infty, \\frac{5}{2}) \\) and \\( (\\frac{8}{3}, \\infty) \\).\n\nSo, the overlap between \\( (\\frac{5}{2}, 3] \\) and the second solution is where \\( (\\frac{5}{2}, 3] \\) intersects with \\( (\\frac{8}{3}, \\infty) \\). Let's see, \\(\\frac{8}{3} \\approx 2.6667\\) and 3 is approximately 3, so \\( (\\frac{8}{3}, 3] \\).\n\nWait, that seems correct because \\( (\\frac{5}{2}, 3] \\) is from 2.5 to 3, and \\( (\\frac{8}{3}, \\infty) \\) starts at about 2.6667. So, the intersection is \\( (\\frac{8}{3}, 3] \\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure. So, the first solution is \\( (\\frac{5}{2}, 3] \\), which is from 2.5 to 3, and the second solution includes \\( (\\frac{8}{3}, \\infty) \\), which is from approximately 2.6667 to infinity. So, the overlap is from 2.6667 to 3, which is \\( (\\frac{8}{3}, 3] \\).\n\nBut wait, let me check if this makes sense. Let me take a point in \\( (\\frac{8}{3}, 3] \\), say \\(x = 2.8\\). Let's check both inequalities:\n\nFirst inequality: \\(3 \\le \\frac{2.8}{2*2.8 - 5}\\). Compute denominator: \\(5.6 - 5 = 0.6\\). So, \\(\\frac{2.8}{0.6} \\approx 4.6667\\), which is indeed greater than or equal to 3.\n\nSecond inequality: \\(\\frac{2.8}{0.6} \\approx 4.6667 < 8\\), which is true.\n\nAnother point, \\(x = 3\\): \\(\\frac{3}{6 - 5} = 3\\), which satisfies both \\(3 \\le 3 < 8\\).\n\nNow, let's check a point just above \\(\\frac{5}{2}\\), say \\(x = 2.6\\). Wait, but 2.6 is less than \\(\\frac{8}{3} \\approx 2.6667\\), so it's not in the intersection. Let me check if \\(x = 2.6\\) satisfies both inequalities.\n\nFirst inequality: \\(3 \\le \\frac{2.6}{5.2 - 5} = \\frac{2.6}{0.2} = 13\\), which is true.\n\nSecond inequality: \\(\\frac{2.6}{0.2} = 13 < 8\\)? No, 13 is not less than 8. So, \\(x = 2.6\\) doesn't satisfy the second inequality, which is why it's excluded from the solution. So, the intersection correctly excludes this point.\n\nTherefore, the solution set is \\( (\\frac{8}{3}, 3] \\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the intersection. The first solution is \\( (\\frac{5}{2}, 3] \\) and the second solution is \\( (-\\infty, \\frac{5}{2}) \\cup (\\frac{8}{3}, \\infty) \\). So, the intersection would be the overlap between \\( (\\frac{5}{2}, 3] \\) and \\( (-\\infty, \\frac{5}{2}) \\cup (\\frac{8}{3}, \\infty) \\).\n\nSince \\( (\\frac{5}{2}, 3] \\) doesn't overlap with \\( (-\\infty, \\frac{5}{2}) \\), the only overlap is with \\( (\\frac{8}{3}, \\infty) \\), which is \\( (\\frac{8}{3}, 3] \\).\n\nSo, the final solution is \\(x \\in (\\frac{8}{3}, 3]\\).\n\nLet me just verify this by testing a point in the interval, say \\(x = 2.7\\), which is approximately \\(\\frac{8}{3} \\approx 2.6667\\).\n\nFirst inequality: \\(3 \\le \\frac{2.7}{5.4 - 5} = \\frac{2.7}{0.4} = 6.75\\), which is true.\n\nSecond inequality: \\(6.75 < 8\\), which is also true.\n\nAnother test at \\(x = 3\\): as before, it works.\n\nAnd at \\(x = 3.5\\), which is just beyond 3, but wait, 3.5 is not in the solution set because our upper limit is 3. Let me check \\(x = 3.5\\):\n\nFirst inequality: \\(3 \\le \\frac{3.5}{7 - 5} = \\frac{3.5}{2} = 1.75\\), which is false. So, \\(x = 3.5\\) doesn't satisfy the first inequality, which is correct because it's not included.\n\nWait, but according to our solution, the interval is up to 3, so that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check \\(x = 2.6667\\) (which is \\(\\frac{8}{3}\\)):\n\nAt \\(x = \\frac{8}{3}\\), the expression \\(\\frac{x}{2x - 5}\\) becomes \\(\\frac{\\frac{8}{3}}{\\frac{16}{3} - 5} = \\frac{\\frac{8}{3}}{\\frac{16}{3} - \\frac{15}{3}} = \\frac{\\frac{8}{3}}{\\frac{1}{3}} = 8\\). So, at \\(x = \\frac{8}{3}\\), the expression equals 8, which doesn't satisfy the second inequality \\(\\frac{x}{2x - 5} < 8\\), so it's excluded. Therefore, our interval correctly starts just above \\(\\frac{8}{3}\\).\n\nSo, putting it all together, the solution is \\(x \\in (\\frac{8}{3}, 3]\\).\n\nWait, let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the second inequality's solution. So, the second inequality after transformation was \\(\\frac{3x - 8}{2x - 5} > 0\\), which had solutions \\(x \\in (-\\infty, \\frac{5}{2}) \\cup (\\frac{8}{3}, \\infty)\\). Then, intersecting with the first solution \\( (\\frac{5}{2}, 3] \\), we get \\( (\\frac{8}{3}, 3] \\).\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, in interval notation, the solution is \\( (\\frac{8}{3}, 3] \\).\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe solution is \\boxed{\\left( \\dfrac{8}{3}, 3 \\right]}\n</think>\n\nTo solve the inequality \\(3 \\le \\frac{x}{2x-5} < 8\\), we break it down into two separate inequalities and solve each part.\n\n1.
