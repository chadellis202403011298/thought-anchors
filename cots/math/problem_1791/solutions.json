Three marbles are selected at random and without replacement. What is the probability that one marble is red and two are blue? Express your answer as a common fraction. Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this problem here about marbles in a bag. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The problem says there's a bag with 10 red marbles and 6 blue marbles. So first off, I should probably figure out the total number of marbles in the bag. That would be 10 red plus 6 blue, right? So 10 + 6 is 16 marbles in total.\n\nNow, the problem asks for the probability that when we select three marbles at random without replacement, one is red and two are blue. Hmm, okay. So I think this is a combinatorics problem because we're dealing with combinations of marbles.\n\nLet me recall, probability is generally the number of favorable outcomes over the total number of possible outcomes. So, I need to find how many ways there are to pick one red and two blue marbles, and then divide that by the total number of ways to pick any three marbles from the bag.\n\nAlright, so first, let's find the total number of ways to pick three marbles from 16. I think that's calculated using combinations, right? The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number we're choosing.\n\nSo, the total number of ways is C(16, 3). Let me compute that. 16! divided by (3! * (16 - 3)!). That simplifies to 16! / (3! * 13!). I can simplify this because 16! is 16 \u00d7 15 \u00d7 14 \u00d7 13!, so the 13! cancels out with the denominator. So, it's (16 \u00d7 15 \u00d7 14) / (3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1). Let me compute that: 16 \u00d7 15 is 240, times 14 is 3360. Then, 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 is 6. So 3360 divided by 6 is 560. So, the total number of ways is 560.\n\nOkay, now for the favorable outcomes: selecting one red and two blue marbles. Let me break this down. There are 10 red marbles, so the number of ways to choose one red marble is C(10, 1). Similarly, the number of ways to choose two blue marbles from 6 is C(6, 2).\n\nSo, C(10, 1) is straightforward. That's just 10, since there are 10 red marbles, and choosing one is simply 10 ways.\n\nNow, C(6, 2) is a bit more involved. Using the combination formula again: 6! / (2! * (6 - 2)!). That's (6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4!) / (2 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 4!). The 4! cancels out, so we have (6 \u00d7 5) / 2. 6 \u00d7 5 is 30, divided by 2 is 15. So, there are 15 ways to choose two blue marbles.\n\nNow, to find the total number of favorable outcomes, we multiply the number of ways to choose one red by the number of ways to choose two blue. So, that's 10 \u00d7 15. Let me compute that: 10 \u00d7 15 is 150. So, there are 150 favorable ways to pick one red and two blue marbles.\n\nWait, hold on, is that right? Let me double-check. So, 10 red marbles, choosing 1, which is 10. 6 blue marbles, choosing 2, which is 15. Multiplying them together gives 150. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes, which is 150 / 560. Now, I should simplify that fraction. Let's see if both numerator and denominator can be divided by the same number.\n\nFirst, let's see if both are divisible by 10. 150 \u00f7 10 is 15, and 560 \u00f7 10 is 56. So, that reduces the fraction to 15/56. Now, let's check if 15 and 56 have any common divisors. 15 factors are 1, 3, 5, 15. 56 factors are 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 14, 28, 56. The only common factor is 1, so 15/56 is the simplified form.\n\nWait a minute, but let me think again. Did I do that right? Because sometimes when you multiply combinations, you have to make sure you're not missing anything. Let me go through it once more.\n\nTotal marbles: 16. Choosing 3: C(16, 3) = 560. That seems right. Choosing 1 red from 10: C(10, 1) = 10. Choosing 2 blue from 6: C(6, 2) = 15. Multiplying them: 10 \u00d7 15 = 150. So, probability is 150/560, which simplifies to 15/56. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the probability step by step using probabilities instead of combinations, but I think the combination method is more straightforward here because it's about selection without order.\n\nWait, another way to approach this: the probability of selecting one red and two blue marbles can be calculated by considering the different orders in which the marbles could be drawn. For example, red first, then blue, then blue; or blue, red, blue; or blue, blue, red. Each of these sequences would have the same probability, so I could compute the probability for one sequence and then multiply by the number of such sequences.\n\nSo, let's try that approach to cross-verify. The probability of drawing a red marble first is 10/16. Then, after drawing one red, there are 9 red and 6 blue left, so 15 marbles. The probability of drawing a blue next is 6/15. Then, after drawing one blue, there are 5 blue left, so 5/14 for the third draw. So, the probability for red, blue, blue is (10/16) * (6/15) * (5/14).\n\nSimilarly, for blue, red, blue: first draw blue is 6/16, then red is 10/15, then blue is 5/14. So, (6/16) * (10/15) * (5/14).\n\nAnd for blue, blue, red: first draw blue is 6/16, second blue is 5/15, then red is 10/14. So, (6/16) * (5/15) * (10/14).\n\nEach of these three scenarios should have the same probability because multiplication is commutative, so I can compute one and multiply by 3.\n\nLet me compute the first one: (10/16) * (6/15) * (5/14). Let's compute each fraction step by step.\n\n10/16 simplifies to 5/8. 6/15 simplifies to 2/5. 5/14 stays as it is.\n\nSo, 5/8 * 2/5 * 5/14. Let's multiply them together:\n\nFirst, 5/8 * 2/5. The 5s cancel out, so we have (1/8) * 2 = 2/8 = 1/4.\n\nThen, 1/4 * 5/14 = 5/56.\n\nSo, the probability for one specific order (red, blue, blue) is 5/56. Since there are three such orders, the total probability is 3 * (5/56) = 15/56.\n\nThat matches the result I got earlier using combinations. So, that's reassuring.\n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the combination approach, let me think again. The number of ways to choose 1 red from 10 is 10, and 2 blue from 6 is 15. So, 10 * 15 is 150. The total number of ways to choose any 3 marbles is 560. So, 150/560 reduces to 15/56. Yep, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is using permutations, but I think combinations are more appropriate here because the order doesn't matter when selecting the marbles. So, using combinations is the right approach.\n\nI think I've double-checked it enough. So, the probability is 15/56.\n</think>\n\nThe probability of selecting one red and two blue marbles when choosing three marbles from the bag is 15/56.\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Determine the total number of marbles:**\n   - Red marbles: 10\n   - Blue marbles: 6\n   - Total marbles: 10 + 6 = 16\n\n2. **Calculate the total number of ways to choose 3 marbles from 16:**\n   - Use combinations: C(16, 3) = 16! / (3! * (16 - 3)!) = (16 \u00d7 15 \u00d7 14) / (3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = 560\n\n3. **Calculate the number of favorable outcomes (1 red and 2 blue):**\n   - Ways to choose 1 red from 10: C(10, 1) = 10\n   - Ways to choose 2 blue from 6: C(6, 2) = (6 \u00d7 5) / (2 \u00d7 1) = 15\n   - Multiply these: 10 \u00d7 15 = 150\n\n4. **Compute the probability:**\n   - Probability = Favorable outcomes / Total outcomes = 150 / 560\n   - Simplify the fraction: Divide numerator and denominator by 10 to get 15/56\n\n5. **Verification using probability step-by-step:**\n   - Consider all possible sequences (red, blue, blue; blue, red, blue; blue, blue, red)\n   - Each sequence has a probability of (10/16)*(6/15)*(5/14) = 5/56\n   - Multiply by 3 sequences: 3*(5/56) = 15/56\n\n**Answer:** The probability is 15/56.\n\n\\boxed{\\dfrac{15}{56}}",
