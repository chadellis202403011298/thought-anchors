The point $(28, t)$ lies on the same line. What is the value of $t?$ \\begin{tabular}{c|c}\n$x$ & $y$ \\\\ \\hline\n1 & 7 \\\\\n3 & 13 \\\\\n5 & 19 \\\\\n\\end{tabular} Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out the value of t when the point (28, t) lies on the same straight line as the points given in the table. The table has three points: (1,7), (3,13), and (5,19). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that if points lie on a straight line, they must satisfy the equation of a line. The general equation for a straight line is y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept. So, my goal is probably to find m and b using the given points, and then plug in x = 28 to find t.\n\nLet me start by finding the slope, m. The slope between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is given by m = (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1). I can use any two points from the table to calculate this. Let me pick the first two points: (1,7) and (3,13).\n\nSo, plugging into the formula, m = (13 - 7)/(3 - 1) = 6/2 = 3. That seems straightforward. So the slope is 3.\n\nWait, let me check this with another pair of points to make sure I didn't make a mistake. How about using (3,13) and (5,19)? So, m = (19 - 13)/(5 - 3) = 6/2 = 3. Yep, same slope. Good, so the slope is definitely 3.\n\nNow that I have the slope, I can use one of the points to find b, the y-intercept. Let's take the first point (1,7). Plugging into the equation y = mx + b, we get 7 = 3*1 + b. So, 7 = 3 + b. Subtracting 3 from both sides, b = 4.\n\nLet me verify this with another point to ensure consistency. Taking (3,13), plugging into y = 3x + 4: 3*3 + 4 = 9 + 4 = 13. Perfect, that's correct. Let's try the last point: (5,19). 3*5 + 4 = 15 + 4 = 19. Yep, that works too. So the equation of the line is y = 3x + 4.\n\nNow, I need to find the value of t when x = 28. So, I'll substitute x = 28 into the equation.\n\nCalculating, y = 3*28 + 4. Let me compute that step by step. 3*28 is 84, and adding 4 gives 88. So, t should be 88.\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors, let me double-check the multiplication. 3 times 28: 3*20 is 60, and 3*8 is 24, so 60 + 24 = 84. Then 84 + 4 is indeed 88. Okay, that seems correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the value of t is 88.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of \\( t \\) is \\boxed{88}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the value of \\( t \\) for the point \\( (28, t) \\) on the same straight line as the given points, we first find the equation of the line.\n\n1. Calculate the slope \\( m \\) using two points from the table:\n   - Using points \\( (1, 7) \\) and \\( (3, 13) \\):\n     \\[\n     m = \\frac{13 - 7}{3 - 1} = \\frac{6}{2} = 3\n     \\]\n   - Verify with another pair of points \\( (3, 13) \\) and \\( (5, 19) \\):\n     \\[\n     m = \\frac{19 - 13}{5 - 3} = \\frac{6}{2} = 3\n     \\]\n   - The slope \\( m \\) is confirmed to be 3.\n\n2. Determine the y-intercept \\( b \\) using one of the points, for example \\( (1, 7) \\):\n   \\[\n   7 = 3 \\cdot 1 + b \\implies 7 = 3 + b \\implies b = 4\n   \\]\n\n3. The equation of the line is:\n   \\[\n   y = 3x + 4\n   \\]\n\n4. Substitute \\( x = 28 \\) into the equation to find \\( t \\):\n   \\[\n   t = 3 \\cdot 28 + 4 = 84 + 4 = 88\n   \\]\n\nThus, the value of \\( t \\) is \\(\\boxed{88}\\).",
