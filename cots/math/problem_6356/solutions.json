Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the sum of the positive integer divisors of 23. Hmm, let's see. First, I remember that a divisor of a number is another number that divides it exactly without leaving any remainder. So, for example, 1 is a divisor of every number because any number divided by 1 is itself, which is an integer. Similarly, the number itself is always a divisor because any number divided by itself is 1, which is also an integer. \n\nNow, 23 is the number we're dealing with here. I know that 23 is a prime number. Wait, is that right? Let me think. A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. So, yes, 23 is a prime number because it doesn't have any divisors other than 1 and 23. \n\nIf that's the case, then the only positive divisors of 23 are 1 and 23. So, to find the sum of these divisors, I just need to add 1 and 23 together. Let me write that out: 1 + 23. \n\nCalculating that, 1 plus 23 equals 24. So, the sum of all the positive integer divisors of 23 is 24. \n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake, let me double-check. Is there any other number that divides 23 evenly? Let's try dividing 23 by some small integers. \n\n23 divided by 2 is 11.5, which is not an integer. 23 divided by 3 is approximately 7.666..., which is also not an integer. 23 divided by 5 is 4.6, not an integer. 23 divided by 7 is about 3.285..., not an integer. And since 23 is less than 49 (which is 7 squared), I don't need to check any higher numbers because the square root of 23 is around 4.796, so I only need to check primes up to 4, which I already did. \n\nSo, yeah, 23 is definitely a prime number, and its only divisors are 1 and itself. Therefore, the sum is 24. I think that's correct. I don't see any other possible divisors, so I must be right.\n</think>\n\nThe positive integer divisors of 23 are 1 and 23. Adding these together gives 1 + 23 = 24.\n\n**Answer:** The sum of the positive integer divisors of 23 is \\boxed{24}.",
