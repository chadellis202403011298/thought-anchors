The fly walks straight across the ceiling to the opposite edge, passing through the center of the circle. It then walks straight to another point on the edge of the circle but not back through the center. The third part of the journey is straight back to the original starting point. If the third part of the journey was 80 feet long, how many total feet did the fly travel over the course of all three parts? Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this math problem here about a fly traveling across a circular room. Let me try to visualize it first. The room is circular with a radius of 58 feet. The fly starts on the edge of the ceiling, walks straight across through the center to the opposite edge, then goes to another point on the edge without going back through the center, and finally returns to the starting point. The third part of the journey is 80 feet long, and I need to find the total distance the fly traveled.\n\nAlright, let's break this down step by step. First, the fly goes from one edge, through the center, to the opposite edge. Since the room is a circle, the distance across through the center is the diameter. The radius is 58 feet, so the diameter would be twice that, which is 58 * 2 = 116 feet. So, the first part of the journey is 116 feet.\n\nNext, the fly goes from that opposite edge to another point on the edge without passing through the center. Let me imagine this. So, the fly is now at a point directly opposite the starting point, and it moves to another point on the circumference. Let's call the starting point A, the opposite point B, and the third point C. So, the fly goes from B to C, and then from C back to A, with the distance from C back to A being 80 feet.\n\nI think I can model this using a triangle. Points A, B, and C form a triangle, where AB is the diameter of the circle, so AB = 116 feet. BC is the second part of the journey, and CA is the third part, which is 80 feet. So, triangle ABC has sides AB = 116, BC = ?, and CA = 80.\n\nWait, but I'm trying to find the total distance, so I need to find BC as well. Maybe I can use the Law of Cosines here. But first, I should figure out the angles involved.\n\nSince AB is the diameter, point C lies somewhere on the circumference. I remember that when you have a triangle inscribed in a circle where one side is the diameter, the angle opposite that side is a right angle. So, triangle ABC is a right-angled triangle at point C. That means angle C is 90 degrees.\n\nWait, that's a key insight. So, triangle ABC is a right-angled triangle with the right angle at C. Therefore, by the Pythagorean theorem, AB\u00b2 = BC\u00b2 + CA\u00b2. We know AB is 116 and CA is 80, so we can solve for BC.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nAB\u00b2 = BC\u00b2 + CA\u00b2\n\n116\u00b2 = BC\u00b2 + 80\u00b2\n\nCalculating 116 squared: 116 * 116. Let me compute that. 100 squared is 10,000, 16 squared is 256, and then the cross term is 2*100*16 = 3,200. So, (100 + 16)\u00b2 = 100\u00b2 + 2*100*16 + 16\u00b2 = 10,000 + 3,200 + 256 = 13,456.\n\nSimilarly, 80 squared is 6,400.\n\nSo, plugging in:\n\n13,456 = BC\u00b2 + 6,400\n\nSubtracting 6,400 from both sides:\n\nBC\u00b2 = 13,456 - 6,400 = 7,056\n\nTaking the square root of 7,056 to find BC:\n\n\u221a7,056. Let me see, 84 squared is 7,056 because 80 squared is 6,400 and 4 squared is 16, so (80 + 4)\u00b2 = 80\u00b2 + 2*80*4 + 4\u00b2 = 6,400 + 640 + 16 = 7,056. So, BC = 84 feet.\n\nNow, the fly's journey has three parts: AB = 116, BC = 84, and CA = 80. So, the total distance is 116 + 84 + 80.\n\nAdding them up: 116 + 84 is 200, and 200 + 80 is 280. So, the fly traveled a total of 280 feet.\n\nWait, let me just double-check that. AB is 116, BC is 84, CA is 80. 116 + 84 is indeed 200, and 200 + 80 is 280. That seems correct.\n\nI think I might have made a mistake in assuming that angle C is 90 degrees, but let me confirm. Since AB is the diameter, any triangle inscribed in the circle with AB as one side will have a right angle at the third point, which is C in this case. So yes, that's correct. Therefore, using the Pythagorean theorem was the right approach.\n\nSo, the total distance is 280 feet.\n</think>\n\nThe fly's journey consists of three straight paths. The first path is the diameter of the circular room, which is 116 feet. The second and third paths form a right-angled triangle with the diameter, allowing us to use the Pythagorean theorem to find the second path's length. The third path is given as 80 feet. Calculating the lengths and summing them gives the total distance.\n\n**Answer:** The fly traveled a total of 280 feet.  \n\\boxed{280}",
