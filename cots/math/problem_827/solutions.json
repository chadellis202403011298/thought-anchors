Problem: When the product $(3x+2y+1)(x+4y+5)$ is expanded, what is the sum of the coefficients of the terms which contain a nonzero power of $y$? Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I need to solve this math problem where I have to expand the product (3x + 2y + 1)(x + 4y + 5) and then find the sum of the coefficients of the terms that have a nonzero power of y. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that expanding two polynomials involves using the distributive property, also known as the FOIL method when dealing with two binomials. But here, each polynomial has three terms, so I'll need to distribute each term in the first polynomial to each term in the second polynomial. That sounds a bit tedious, but I think I can manage it by being careful.\n\nLet me write down the expression again to visualize it better:\n\n(3x + 2y + 1)(x + 4y + 5)\n\nI'll start by distributing each term in the first parenthesis to each term in the second one. Let's do this term by term.\n\nFirst, take 3x and multiply it by each term in the second polynomial:\n\n3x * x = 3x\u00b2\n3x * 4y = 12xy\n3x * 5 = 15x\n\nOkay, so that gives me three terms: 3x\u00b2, 12xy, and 15x.\n\nNext, take 2y and multiply it by each term in the second polynomial:\n\n2y * x = 2xy\n2y * 4y = 8y\u00b2\n2y * 5 = 10y\n\nSo, from 2y, I get 2xy, 8y\u00b2, and 10y.\n\nNow, moving on to the last term in the first polynomial, which is 1. I'll distribute this as well:\n\n1 * x = x\n1 * 4y = 4y\n1 * 5 = 5\n\nThat gives me x, 4y, and 5.\n\nNow, I'll write down all the terms I've obtained from the distribution:\n\n3x\u00b2, 12xy, 15x, 2xy, 8y\u00b2, 10y, x, 4y, 5.\n\nNext, I need to combine like terms. Like terms are terms that have the same variables raised to the same powers. So, let's group them:\n\n- The x\u00b2 term: 3x\u00b2\n- The xy terms: 12xy and 2xy\n- The y\u00b2 term: 8y\u00b2\n- The x terms: 15x and x\n- The y terms: 10y and 4y\n- The constant term: 5\n\nLet me combine each group:\n\n1. For xy terms: 12xy + 2xy = 14xy\n2. For x terms: 15x + x = 16x\n3. For y terms: 10y + 4y = 14y\n\nSo, after combining like terms, the expanded expression becomes:\n\n3x\u00b2 + 14xy + 8y\u00b2 + 16x + 14y + 5\n\nNow, the problem asks for the sum of the coefficients of the terms that contain a nonzero power of y. So, I need to identify which terms have y raised to a power greater than zero.\n\nLooking at each term:\n\n- 3x\u00b2: This has no y term, so we can ignore it.\n- 14xy: This has y to the first power, so we include it.\n- 8y\u00b2: This has y squared, so we include it.\n- 16x: Again, no y term, so we skip.\n- 14y: This has y to the first power, so include it.\n- 5: This is a constant term, no y, so we skip.\n\nSo, the terms with nonzero y powers are 14xy, 8y\u00b2, and 14y. Now, I need to find the coefficients of these terms and sum them up.\n\nThe coefficients are:\n\n- For 14xy: 14\n- For 8y\u00b2: 8\n- For 14y: 14\n\nAdding these together: 14 + 8 + 14.\n\nLet me compute that step by step:\n\n14 + 8 = 22\n\n22 + 14 = 36\n\nSo, the sum of the coefficients is 36.\n\nWait, let me double-check my work to make sure I didn't make a mistake in expanding or combining terms.\n\nExpanding (3x + 2y + 1)(x + 4y + 5):\n\nFirst term: 3x*x = 3x\u00b2\n\n3x*4y = 12xy\n\n3x*5 = 15x\n\nSecond term: 2y*x = 2xy\n\n2y*4y = 8y\u00b2\n\n2y*5 = 10y\n\nThird term: 1*x = x\n\n1*4y = 4y\n\n1*5 = 5\n\nCombined terms:\n\n3x\u00b2, 12xy, 15x, 2xy, 8y\u00b2, 10y, x, 4y, 5.\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n3x\u00b2\n\n12xy + 2xy = 14xy\n\n8y\u00b2\n\n15x + x = 16x\n\n10y + 4y = 14y\n\n5\n\nSo, the expanded form is correct: 3x\u00b2 + 14xy + 8y\u00b2 + 16x + 14y + 5.\n\nNow, the terms with y are 14xy, 8y\u00b2, and 14y. Their coefficients are 14, 8, and 14, which add up to 36. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a smarter way to approach this problem without expanding the entire expression. Sometimes, for problems that ask for the sum of coefficients, you can plug in specific values for variables to simplify the calculation.\n\nWait, the problem asks for the sum of coefficients of terms with nonzero y powers. So, if I think about the expanded expression, each term is of the form (coefficient)*(some variables). The coefficients are the numerical parts, and the variables can be x and y.\n\nBut the problem is about terms that have y with a nonzero power, so we're excluding any terms that don't have y, like the constant term and the terms with only x.\n\nSo, another approach might be to consider that the sum of coefficients for terms with y is equal to the sum of the coefficients when we set y=1, but then subtract the terms where y=0, but I'm not sure if that's simpler.\n\nWait, actually, maybe I can compute the sum of all coefficients for terms with y by plugging y=1 and then subtracting the constant term (which is when y=0). Let me try that.\n\nLet me define the original expression as P(x, y) = (3x + 2y + 1)(x + 4y + 5). If I set y=1, then P(x,1) = (3x + 2*1 + 1)(x + 4*1 + 5) = (3x + 3)(x + 9).\n\nExpanding this: 3x*(x + 9) + 3*(x + 9) = 3x\u00b2 + 27x + 3x + 27 = 3x\u00b2 + 30x + 27.\n\nNow, if I set y=0, then P(x,0) = (3x + 0 + 1)(x + 0 + 5) = (3x + 1)(x + 5).\n\nExpanding this: 3x*(x +5) +1*(x +5) = 3x\u00b2 +15x +x +5 = 3x\u00b2 +16x +5.\n\nNow, the sum of the coefficients of terms with y is equal to P(x,1) minus P(x,0), because P(x,1) includes all terms with y set to 1, and P(x,0) includes all terms with y set to 0. So, subtracting P(x,0) from P(x,1) would give the sum of the coefficients of the terms that have y in them.\n\nSo, P(x,1) = 3x\u00b2 +30x +27\n\nP(x,0) = 3x\u00b2 +16x +5\n\nSubtracting: (3x\u00b2 +30x +27) - (3x\u00b2 +16x +5) = (0x\u00b2) +14x +22.\n\nWait, that gives 14x +22, which is a linear expression. But I'm supposed to find the sum of the coefficients, which would be when x=1 as well. Hmm, maybe I need to evaluate this at x=1 to get the sum of coefficients.\n\nSo, if I set x=1 in (14x +22), I get 14*1 +22 = 36.\n\nAlternatively, if I set both x=1 and y=1, then P(1,1) = (3*1 +2*1 +1)(1 +4*1 +5) = (3+2+1)(1+4+5) = (6)(10) = 60.\n\nP(1,0) = (3*1 +0 +1)(1 +0 +5) = (4)(6) = 24.\n\nSo, the sum of coefficients with y terms would be P(1,1) - P(1,0) = 60 -24 = 36, which matches the previous result.\n\nSo, that's another way to approach it, which might be faster if I remember this trick. But since I'm just starting out, maybe it's better to stick with expanding the expression and then adding up the coefficients.\n\nIn any case, both methods give me 36 as the sum of the coefficients of the terms with nonzero y powers. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe sum of the coefficients is \\boxed{36}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem of finding the sum of the coefficients of the terms which contain a nonzero power of \\( y \\) in the product \\((3x + 2y + 1)(x + 4y + 5)\\), we start by expanding the product.\n\nFirst, we distribute each term in the first polynomial to each term in the second polynomial:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n(3x + 2y + 1)(x + 4y + 5) &= 3x \\cdot x + 3x \\cdot 4y + 3x \\cdot 5 + 2y \\cdot x + 2y \\cdot 4y + 2y \\cdot 5 + 1 \\cdot x + 1 \\cdot 4y + 1 \\cdot 5 \\\\\n&= 3x^2 + 12xy + 15x + 2xy + 8y^2 + 10y + x + 4y + 5.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nNext, we combine like terms:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n3x^2 + (12xy + 2xy) + 8y^2 + (15x + x) + (10y + 4y) + 5 &= 3x^2 + 14xy + 8y^2 + 16x + 14y + 5.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nThe terms containing a nonzero power of \\( y \\) are \\( 14xy \\), \\( 8y^2 \\), and \\( 14y \\). The coefficients of these terms are 14, 8, and 14, respectively.\n\nAdding these coefficients together:\n\n\\[\n14 + 8 + 14 = 36.\n\\]\n\nThus, the sum of the coefficients of the terms which contain a nonzero power of \\( y \\) is \\(\\boxed{36}\\).",
