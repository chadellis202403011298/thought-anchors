Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I need to solve this inequality: 5 minus 4x is greater than 17. Hmm, let's see. I think I should start by trying to isolate x. So, first, I can subtract 5 from both sides to get rid of that constant term on the left. Let me write that down.\n\n5 - 4x > 17\n\nSubtracting 5 from both sides gives me:\n\n-4x > 17 - 5\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n-4x > 12\n\nNow, I need to solve for x, so I have to get rid of that -4 coefficient. To do that, I'll divide both sides by -4. Wait, but I remember that when you divide or multiply both sides of an inequality by a negative number, the direction of the inequality sign flips. So, I need to make sure I reverse the greater than sign to a less than sign.\n\nDividing both sides by -4:\n\nx < 12 / (-4)\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nx < -3\n\nOkay, so x has to be less than -3. But the problem is asking for the greatest integer value of x that satisfies this inequality. So, since x is less than -3, the largest integer that is still less than -3 would be -4, because -3 is not included. Let me check that.\n\nIf I plug x = -4 into the original inequality:\n\n5 - 4*(-4) = 5 + 16 = 21\n\nIs 21 > 17? Yes, that's true.\n\nWhat if I try x = -3:\n\n5 - 4*(-3) = 5 + 12 = 17\n\nBut the inequality is 5 - 4x > 17, so 17 is not greater than 17. It's equal, which doesn't satisfy the inequality. So, -3 doesn't work, but -4 does. Therefore, the greatest integer value is -4.\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my steps. Let me go through it again.\n\nStarting with 5 - 4x > 17.\n\nSubtract 5: -4x > 12.\n\nDivide by -4 and flip the inequality: x < -3.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the integers less than -3 are -4, -5, -6, etc., but the greatest one is -4.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes here. So, the answer should be -4.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the inequality \\(5 - 4x > 17\\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Subtract 5 from both sides**:\n   \\[\n   5 - 4x - 5 > 17 - 5 \\implies -4x > 12\n   \\]\n\n2. **Divide both sides by -4** and reverse the inequality sign:\n   \\[\n   x < \\frac{12}{-4} \\implies x < -3\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the greatest integer less than -3**, which is -4.\n\n**Answer:** The greatest integer value of \\(x\\) is \\(\\boxed{-4}\\).",
