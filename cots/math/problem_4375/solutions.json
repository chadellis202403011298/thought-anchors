Problem: Let $r_1,$ $r_2,$ and $r_3$ be the roots of\n\\[x^3 - 3x^2 + 8 = 0.\\]Find the monic polynomial, in $x,$ whose roots are $2r_1,$ $2r_2,$ and $2r_3.$ Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the monic polynomial whose roots are 2r1, 2r2, and 2r3, where r1, r2, r3 are the roots of the given polynomial x\u00b3 - 3x\u00b2 + 8 = 0. Hmm, monic means the leading coefficient is 1, so that's good because I think I can do that by scaling or something.\n\nFirst, I remember that if you have a polynomial with roots multiplied by a constant, you can find the new polynomial by substituting x with x divided by that constant. Wait, let me think. If the original roots are r1, r2, r3, and I want roots at 2r1, 2r2, 2r3, then I should substitute x/2 into the original polynomial, right? Because if I plug in x = 2r1, then x/2 = r1, so the original polynomial would be zero. So, the new polynomial would be P(x/2), where P is the original polynomial.\n\nLet me write that down. The original polynomial is P(x) = x\u00b3 - 3x\u00b2 + 8. So, substituting x/2 into P, I get P(x/2) = (x/2)\u00b3 - 3(x/2)\u00b2 + 8. Let me compute each term.\n\nFirst, (x/2)\u00b3 is x\u00b3/8. Then, 3(x/2)\u00b2 is 3*(x\u00b2/4) = 3x\u00b2/4. So putting it all together, P(x/2) = x\u00b3/8 - 3x\u00b2/4 + 8. Hmm, but this isn't monic yet because the leading term is x\u00b3/8, which is 1/8 times x\u00b3. So, to make it monic, I should multiply the entire polynomial by 8.\n\nWait, let me check that. If I multiply each term by 8, I get 8*(x\u00b3/8) = x\u00b3, 8*(-3x\u00b2/4) = -6x\u00b2, and 8*8 = 64. So, the polynomial becomes x\u00b3 - 6x\u00b2 + 64. Is that correct?\n\nWait a second, let me verify. If I have a polynomial with roots 2r1, 2r2, 2r3, then by definition, the polynomial should satisfy that when x = 2r1, the polynomial is zero. So, let's check with the original polynomial. If I plug in x = 2r1 into the new polynomial, does it equal zero?\n\nSo, new polynomial is x\u00b3 - 6x\u00b2 + 64. Plugging in x = 2r1, we get (2r1)\u00b3 - 6*(2r1)\u00b2 + 64. Let's compute that: 8r1\u00b3 - 6*(4r1\u00b2) + 64 = 8r1\u00b3 - 24r1\u00b2 + 64.\n\nNow, from the original equation, since r1 is a root, we know that r1\u00b3 - 3r1\u00b2 + 8 = 0. So, r1\u00b3 = 3r1\u00b2 - 8. Let's substitute that into the expression above: 8*(3r1\u00b2 - 8) - 24r1\u00b2 + 64.\n\nExpanding that, 24r1\u00b2 - 64 - 24r1\u00b2 + 64. The 24r1\u00b2 and -24r1\u00b2 cancel out, and -64 +64 is zero. So, yes, it works for x = 2r1. That seems correct.\n\nBut wait, let me go back. I thought of substituting x/2 into the original polynomial and then scaling. Is that the right approach? Because sometimes when you scale roots, you can also use Vieta's formulas to find the new polynomial.\n\nLet me try that approach as well to see if I get the same result. Vieta's formulas relate the coefficients of the polynomial to sums and products of roots. The original polynomial is x\u00b3 - 3x\u00b2 + 8 = 0, so the sum of roots r1 + r2 + r3 = 3 (since the coefficient of x\u00b2 is -3, and Vieta's formula says sum of roots is equal to the coefficient of x\u00b2 with a negative sign). The sum of products two at a time, r1r2 + r1r3 + r2r3 = 0, because there's no x term. And the product of the roots r1r2r3 = -8, because the constant term is 8, and for a cubic x\u00b3 + ax\u00b2 + bx + c, the product is -c, so here it's -8.\n\nNow, if the new roots are 2r1, 2r2, 2r3, then the sum of the new roots is 2r1 + 2r2 + 2r3 = 2(r1 + r2 + r3) = 2*3 = 6.\n\nThe sum of products two at a time for the new roots would be (2r1)(2r2) + (2r1)(2r3) + (2r2)(2r3) = 4(r1r2 + r1r3 + r2r3) = 4*0 = 0.\n\nThe product of the new roots is (2r1)(2r2)(2r3) = 8(r1r2r3) = 8*(-8) = -64.\n\nSo, using Vieta's, the new polynomial would be x\u00b3 - (sum)x\u00b2 + (sum two at a time)x - (product). So, substituting the values, we have x\u00b3 - 6x\u00b2 + 0x - (-64). Wait, hold on, product is -64, so the constant term is -(-64) = 64? Wait, no, the polynomial is x\u00b3 - (sum)x\u00b2 + (sum two at a time)x - (product). So, product is -64, so the constant term is -(-64) = 64.\n\nWait, but in the polynomial, it's minus the product, so if product is -64, then it's -(-64) = 64. So, the polynomial is x\u00b3 - 6x\u00b2 + 0x + 64, which simplifies to x\u00b3 - 6x\u00b2 + 64.\n\nWait, that's the same result as before. So that's a good consistency check. So, both methods give me the same polynomial, so I think that's correct.\n\nBut let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in either substitution or Vieta's. Let me go through the substitution method again.\n\nOriginal polynomial: x\u00b3 - 3x\u00b2 + 8. Let me substitute x with x/2, so P(x/2) = (x/2)\u00b3 - 3(x/2)\u00b2 + 8. Compute each term:\n\n(x/2)\u00b3 = x\u00b3/8.\n\n3*(x/2)\u00b2 = 3*(x\u00b2/4) = 3x\u00b2/4.\n\nSo, P(x/2) = x\u00b3/8 - 3x\u00b2/4 + 8.\n\nTo make this monic, I need to multiply each term by 8:\n\n8*(x\u00b3/8) = x\u00b3,\n\n8*(-3x\u00b2/4) = -6x\u00b2,\n\n8*8 = 64.\n\nSo, the polynomial becomes x\u00b3 - 6x\u00b2 + 64, which is the same as before.\n\nSo, both methods lead me to the same result, so I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me try plugging in x = 2r1 into the new polynomial and see if it equals zero.\n\nGiven that r1 is a root of x\u00b3 - 3x\u00b2 + 8 = 0, so r1\u00b3 = 3r1\u00b2 - 8.\n\nCompute (2r1)\u00b3 - 6*(2r1)\u00b2 + 64:\n\n= 8r1\u00b3 - 6*4r1\u00b2 + 64\n\n= 8r1\u00b3 - 24r1\u00b2 + 64.\n\nNow, substitute r1\u00b3 = 3r1\u00b2 - 8:\n\n= 8*(3r1\u00b2 - 8) - 24r1\u00b2 + 64\n\n= 24r1\u00b2 - 64 - 24r1\u00b2 + 64\n\n= (24r1\u00b2 - 24r1\u00b2) + (-64 + 64)\n\n= 0 + 0 = 0.\n\nYes, that works. So, 2r1 is indeed a root of the new polynomial. Similarly, it should work for 2r2 and 2r3 as well.\n\nSo, I think I can confidently say that the monic polynomial with roots 2r1, 2r2, 2r3 is x\u00b3 - 6x\u00b2 + 64.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can also compute it using another method, like expanding (x - 2r1)(x - 2r2)(x - 2r3).\n\nLet me try that. So, (x - 2r1)(x - 2r2)(x - 2r3) = x\u00b3 - 2(r1 + r2 + r3)x\u00b2 + 4(r1r2 + r1r3 + r2r3)x - 8r1r2r3.\n\nNow, from Vieta's on the original polynomial:\n\nr1 + r2 + r3 = 3,\n\nr1r2 + r1r3 + r2r3 = 0,\n\nr1r2r3 = -8.\n\nSo, substituting these into the expanded form:\n\n= x\u00b3 - 2*(3)x\u00b2 + 4*(0)x - 8*(-8)\n\n= x\u00b3 - 6x\u00b2 + 0x + 64\n\n= x\u00b3 - 6x\u00b2 + 64.\n\nSame result. So, that's consistent as well. Okay, so that's definitely correct.\n\nI think I've checked it enough ways. So, the answer should be x\u00b3 - 6x\u00b2 + 64.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe monic polynomial is \\boxed{x^3 - 6x^2 + 64}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the monic polynomial whose roots are \\(2r_1\\), \\(2r_2\\), and \\(2r_3\\), where \\(r_1\\), \\(r_2\\), and \\(r_3\\) are the roots of the polynomial \\(x^3 - 3x^2 + 8 = 0\\), we can use the substitution method and Vieta's formulas.\n\n1. **Substitution Method**:\n   - The original polynomial is \\(P(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 + 8\\).\n   - Substitute \\(x/2\\) into \\(P(x)\\) to get \\(P(x/2)\\):\n     \\[\n     P\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)^3 - 3\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)^2 + 8\n     \\]\n   - Simplify each term:\n     \\[\n     \\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)^3 = \\frac{x^3}{8}, \\quad 3\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{3x^2}{4}\n     \\]\n   - Thus,\n     \\[\n     P\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right) = \\frac{x^3}{8} - \\frac{3x^2}{4} + 8\n     \\]\n   - Multiply by 8 to make it monic:\n     \\[\n     8 \\left( \\frac{x^3}{8} - \\frac{3x^2}{4} + 8 \\right) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 64\n     \\]\n\n2. **Vieta's Formulas**:\n   - For the original polynomial, the sum of roots \\(r_1 + r_2 + r_3 = 3\\), the sum of products two at a time \\(r_1r_2 + r_1r_3 + r_2r_3 = 0\\), and the product \\(r_1r_2r_3 = -8\\).\n   - For the new roots \\(2r_1, 2r_2, 2r_3\\):\n     - Sum: \\(2(r_1 + r_2 + r_3) = 6\\)\n     - Sum of products two at a time: \\(4(r_1r_2 + r_1r_3 + r_2r_3) = 0\\)\n     - Product: \\(8(r_1r_2r_3) = -64\\)\n   - The new polynomial is:\n     \\[\n     x^3 - (6)x^2 + (0)x - (-64) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 64\n     \\]\n\nBoth methods confirm that the monic polynomial is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{x^3 - 6x^2 + 64}\n\\]",
