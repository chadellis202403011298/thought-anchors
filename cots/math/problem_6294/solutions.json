How many diagonals does a convex decagon have? Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how many diagonals a convex decagon has. Hmm, let me start by recalling what a decagon is. A decagon is a 10-sided polygon, right? And since it's convex, all its interior angles are less than 180 degrees, and none of its sides bend back on themselves. \n\nI remember that the problem mentioned a square has two diagonals and a convex pentagon has five diagonals. So maybe there's a pattern or formula here that I can use to find the number of diagonals in a decagon. Let me think about how diagonals work in polygons.\n\nIn a square, which is a quadrilateral, each vertex connects to two other vertices with sides, and the other connections are diagonals. Since a square has four vertices, each vertex connects to one other vertex via a diagonal, but since each diagonal is counted twice (once from each end), the total number of diagonals is 4*(4-3)/2 = 2. Wait, that formula might not be right. Let me try another approach.\n\nI think the general formula for the number of diagonals in a convex polygon is n(n - 3)/2, where n is the number of sides. Let me check if that works for the square and the pentagon.\n\nFor a square, n = 4. Plugging into the formula: 4*(4 - 3)/2 = 4*1/2 = 2. That's correct, as given in the problem. Now for the pentagon, n = 5. So, 5*(5 - 3)/2 = 5*2/2 = 5. That also matches the problem statement. Okay, so the formula seems to work.\n\nSo, applying this formula to a decagon, which has 10 sides, n = 10. Let's plug that into the formula: 10*(10 - 3)/2. Let me compute that step by step. First, 10 - 3 is 7. Then, 10*7 is 70. Finally, 70 divided by 2 is 35. So, the decagon should have 35 diagonals.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another way to think about it is that each vertex in an n-sided polygon can connect to n - 3 other vertices via diagonals. Why n - 3? Because you can't connect a vertex to itself, and you can't connect it to its two adjacent vertices because those connections are sides, not diagonals. So, for each vertex, there are n - 3 diagonals. Since there are n vertices, that would give n*(n - 3) diagonals. But wait, that counts each diagonal twice because each diagonal connects two vertices. So, to get the correct count, I need to divide by 2. That's why the formula is n(n - 3)/2.\n\nLet me test this with a pentagon again. n = 5, so 5*(5 - 3)/2 = 5*2/2 = 5. Correct. For a hexagon, n = 6, so 6*(6 - 3)/2 = 6*3/2 = 9 diagonals. I think that's right because a hexagon has more diagonals than a pentagon. So, going back to the decagon, n = 10, so 10*(10 - 3)/2 = 10*7/2 = 70/2 = 35. That seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the total number of line segments that can be formed by connecting any two vertices in a decagon. That's the combination of 10 vertices taken 2 at a time, which is C(10, 2) = 10*9/2 = 45. But this total includes all the sides of the decagon as well. Since a decagon has 10 sides, the number of diagonals would be 45 - 10 = 35. That's another way to arrive at the same answer, which reinforces that 35 is correct.\n\nSo, both methods give me 35 diagonals for a convex decagon. I think that's the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe number of diagonals in a convex decagon can be calculated using the formula for the number of diagonals in a convex polygon, which is n(n - 3)/2, where n is the number of sides. For a decagon, n = 10. Plugging this into the formula:\n\n10*(10 - 3)/2 = 10*7/2 = 70/2 = 35.\n\n**Answer:** The convex decagon has \\boxed{35} diagonals.",
