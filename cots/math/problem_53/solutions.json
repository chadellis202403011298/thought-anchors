Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this math problem here: If \\( m + \\frac{1}{m} = 8 \\), then what is the value of \\( m^2 + \\frac{1}{m^2} + 4 \\)? Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on algebra, but I remember there are some identities that relate expressions like these.\n\nFirst, I know that when you have an expression like \\( m + \\frac{1}{m} \\), squaring both sides can help you find \\( m^2 + \\frac{1}{m^2} \\). Let me try that. So, if I square both sides of the equation \\( m + \\frac{1}{m} = 8 \\), I should get:\n\n\\[\n\\left( m + \\frac{1}{m} \\right)^2 = 8^2\n\\]\n\nCalculating the right side, 8 squared is 64, so that becomes:\n\n\\[\nm^2 + 2 \\cdot m \\cdot \\frac{1}{m} + \\frac{1}{m^2} = 64\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the middle term, \\( 2 \\cdot m \\cdot \\frac{1}{m} \\) is just 2, because the m's cancel out. So now the equation is:\n\n\\[\nm^2 + 2 + \\frac{1}{m^2} = 64\n\\]\n\nHmm, okay, so if I subtract 2 from both sides, I can isolate \\( m^2 + \\frac{1}{m^2} \\):\n\n\\[\nm^2 + \\frac{1}{m^2} = 64 - 2\n\\]\n\\[\nm^2 + \\frac{1}{m^2} = 62\n\\]\n\nAlright, so now I have the value of \\( m^2 + \\frac{1}{m^2} \\) as 62. But the problem is asking for \\( m^2 + \\frac{1}{m^2} + 4 \\). So, I just need to add 4 to 62, right?\n\nLet me write that down:\n\n\\[\nm^2 + \\frac{1}{m^2} + 4 = 62 + 4\n\\]\n\\[\n= 66\n\\]\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Let me double-check to make sure I didn't skip any steps or make a mistake. So, starting from \\( m + 1/m = 8 \\), squaring both sides gives \\( m^2 + 2 + 1/m^2 = 64 \\), which simplifies to \\( m^2 + 1/m^2 = 62 \\). Then adding 4 gives 66. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nI don't think I made any calculation errors here. The key was recognizing that squaring the original equation would help find the value needed. So, I'm confident that the answer is 66.\n</think>\n\nThe value of \\( m^2 + \\frac{1}{m^2} + 4 \\) is 66.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Given Equation:**\n   \\[\n   m + \\frac{1}{m} = 8\n   \\]\n\n2. **Square Both Sides:**\n   \\[\n   \\left( m + \\frac{1}{m} \\right)^2 = 8^2\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   m^2 + 2 \\cdot m \\cdot \\frac{1}{m} + \\frac{1}{m^2} = 64\n   \\]\n\n3. **Simplify the Middle Term:**\n   \\[\n   m^2 + 2 + \\frac{1}{m^2} = 64\n   \\]\n\n4. **Isolate \\( m^2 + \\frac{1}{m^2} \\):**\n   \\[\n   m^2 + \\frac{1}{m^2} = 64 - 2\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   m^2 + \\frac{1}{m^2} = 62\n   \\]\n\n5. **Add 4 to the Result:**\n   \\[\n   m^2 + \\frac{1}{m^2} + 4 = 62 + 4\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = 66\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{66}\n\\]",
