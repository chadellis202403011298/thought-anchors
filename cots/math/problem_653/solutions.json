Problem: In a sequence of positive integers each term after the first is $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the sum of the term that precedes it and the term that follows it in the sequence. What is the 5th term of this sequence if the 1st term is 2 and the 4th term is 34? Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.\n\n\"In a sequence of positive integers, each term after the first is 1/3 of the sum of the term that precedes it and the term that follows it in the sequence. What is the 5th term of this sequence if the 1st term is 2 and the 4th term is 34?\"\n\nAlright, so we're dealing with a sequence where each term (starting from the second one) is one-third of the sum of its immediate neighbors. The first term is 2, and the fourth term is 34. We need to find the fifth term.\n\nLet me break this down. Let's denote the terms of the sequence as a\u2081, a\u2082, a\u2083, a\u2084, a\u2085, and so on. We know that a\u2081 = 2 and a\u2084 = 34. We need to find a\u2085.\n\nThe problem says that each term after the first is 1/3 of the sum of the term before it and the term after it. So, for any term a\u2099 where n \u2265 2, the formula would be:\n\na\u2099 = (a\u2099\u208b\u2081 + a\u2099\u208a\u2081) / 3\n\nHmm, that's interesting. So each term is kind of an average of its neighbors, but only a third of their sum. Let me write this down more clearly.\n\nGiven that, for n \u2265 2,\n\na\u2099 = (a\u2099\u208b\u2081 + a\u2099\u208a\u2081) / 3\n\nI can rearrange this equation to solve for a\u2099\u208a\u2081. Let's do that.\n\nMultiplying both sides by 3:\n\n3a\u2099 = a\u2099\u208b\u2081 + a\u2099\u208a\u2081\n\nThen, subtract a\u2099\u208b\u2081 from both sides:\n\na\u2099\u208a\u2081 = 3a\u2099 - a\u2099\u208b\u2081\n\nSo, this gives me a recursive formula where each term can be found if I know the two preceding terms. That's helpful.\n\nLet me list out what I know:\n\n- a\u2081 = 2\n- a\u2084 = 34\n\nWe need to find a\u2085, but to get there, I probably need to find a\u2082, a\u2083, and then a\u2084, which is given, and then use that to find a\u2085.\n\nWait, but I already know a\u2084, so maybe I can work backward or forward from there.\n\nLet me see. Since a\u2084 is given, perhaps I can use the recursive formula to express a\u2083 in terms of a\u2082 and a\u2084. Then, maybe express a\u2082 in terms of a\u2081 and a\u2083, and so on.\n\nLet me try to write down the relationships for each term.\n\nStarting with a\u2082:\n\na\u2082 = (a\u2081 + a\u2083) / 3\n\nSimilarly, a\u2083 = (a\u2082 + a\u2084) / 3\n\nAnd a\u2084 = (a\u2083 + a\u2085) / 3\n\nWait, but a\u2084 is given as 34, so maybe I can use that to find a\u2085.\n\nWait, but let's proceed step by step. Let me list the equations based on the given formula.\n\nFor a\u2082:\n\na\u2082 = (a\u2081 + a\u2083) / 3\n\nFor a\u2083:\n\na\u2083 = (a\u2082 + a\u2084) / 3\n\nFor a\u2084:\n\na\u2084 = (a\u2083 + a\u2085) / 3\n\nWe know a\u2081 = 2, a\u2084 = 34, so let's plug those in.\n\nStarting with a\u2084:\n\n34 = (a\u2083 + a\u2085) / 3\n\nMultiply both sides by 3:\n\n102 = a\u2083 + a\u2085\n\nSo, equation (1): a\u2083 + a\u2085 = 102\n\nNow, let's look at a\u2083:\n\na\u2083 = (a\u2082 + a\u2084) / 3\n\nWe know a\u2084 is 34, so:\n\na\u2083 = (a\u2082 + 34) / 3\n\nEquation (2): a\u2083 = (a\u2082 + 34) / 3\n\nSimilarly, for a\u2082:\n\na\u2082 = (a\u2081 + a\u2083) / 3\n\nWe know a\u2081 is 2, so:\n\na\u2082 = (2 + a\u2083) / 3\n\nEquation (3): a\u2082 = (2 + a\u2083) / 3\n\nNow, let's see if we can substitute equation (3) into equation (2).\n\nFrom equation (3), a\u2082 = (2 + a\u2083)/3\n\nSubstitute into equation (2):\n\na\u2083 = [ (2 + a\u2083)/3 + 34 ] / 3\n\nLet me simplify that step by step.\n\nFirst, let's compute the numerator inside the brackets:\n\n(2 + a\u2083)/3 + 34\n\nTo add these, it's easier if I express 34 as 34/1. To add fractions, they need a common denominator. The denominator here is 3, so I can write 34 as (34*3)/3 = 102/3.\n\nSo, (2 + a\u2083)/3 + 102/3 = [ (2 + a\u2083) + 102 ] / 3 = (a\u2083 + 104) / 3\n\nTherefore, equation (2) becomes:\n\na\u2083 = [ (a\u2083 + 104) / 3 ] / 3\n\nWhich is the same as:\n\na\u2083 = (a\u2083 + 104) / 9\n\nNow, let's solve for a\u2083.\n\nMultiply both sides by 9:\n\n9a\u2083 = a\u2083 + 104\n\nSubtract a\u2083 from both sides:\n\n8a\u2083 = 104\n\nDivide both sides by 8:\n\na\u2083 = 104 / 8 = 13\n\nSo, a\u2083 is 13.\n\nNow that we have a\u2083, let's find a\u2082 using equation (3):\n\na\u2082 = (2 + a\u2083) / 3 = (2 + 13) / 3 = 15 / 3 = 5\n\nSo, a\u2082 is 5.\n\nNow, let's go back to equation (1): a\u2083 + a\u2085 = 102\n\nWe know a\u2083 is 13, so:\n\n13 + a\u2085 = 102\n\nSubtract 13 from both sides:\n\na\u2085 = 102 - 13 = 89\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Let me just check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nLet me recap:\n\na\u2081 = 2\n\na\u2082 = 5\n\na\u2083 = 13\n\na\u2084 = 34\n\na\u2085 = 89\n\nLet me verify if each term after the first satisfies the condition that it's 1/3 of the sum of its neighbors.\n\nStarting with a\u2082:\n\na\u2082 should be (a\u2081 + a\u2083)/3\n\n(2 + 13)/3 = 15/3 = 5, which matches a\u2082 = 5. Good.\n\nNext, a\u2083:\n\na\u2083 should be (a\u2082 + a\u2084)/3\n\n(5 + 34)/3 = 39/3 = 13, which matches a\u2083 = 13. Good.\n\nNext, a\u2084:\n\na\u2084 should be (a\u2083 + a\u2085)/3\n\n(13 + 89)/3 = 102/3 = 34, which matches a\u2084 = 34. Perfect.\n\nSo, all terms satisfy the condition. Therefore, a\u2085 is indeed 89.\n\nI think that makes sense. The sequence is progressing in such a way that each term is a third of the sum of its neighbors, and with the given first and fourth terms, the fifth term comes out to be 89.\n\nJust to make sure, let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using a different formula or method, but I think the way I did it is solid. I used substitution to express each term in terms of the next, and that led me to find a\u2083, then a\u2082, and finally a\u2085. It all checks out.\n\nSo, I'm confident that the fifth term is 89.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe 5th term of the sequence is \\boxed{89}.\n</think>\n\nGiven a sequence of positive integers where each term after the first is \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) of the sum of the term that precedes it and the term that follows it, we need to find the 5th term. The first term is 2 and the fourth term is 34.\n\nWe denote the terms of the sequence as \\(a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5\\). We know:\n- \\(a_1 = 2\\)\n- \\(a_4 = 34\\)\n\nThe given condition translates to the formula:\n\\[ a_n = \\frac{a_{n-1} + a_{n+1}}{3} \\quad \\text{for} \\quad n \\geq 2 \\]\n\nRearranging this formula, we get:\n\\[ 3a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n+1} \\]\n\\[ a_{n+1} = 3a_n - a_{n-1} \\]\n\nUsing this recursive formula, we can express the terms as follows:\n\n1. For \\(a_4\\):\n   \\[ 34 = \\frac{a_3 + a_5}{3} \\]\n   \\[ 102 = a_3 + a_5 \\]\n\n2. For \\(a_3\\):\n   \\[ a_3 = \\frac{a_2 + a_4}{3} \\]\n   \\[ a_3 = \\frac{a_2 + 34}{3} \\]\n\n3. For \\(a_2\\):\n   \\[ a_2 = \\frac{a_1 + a_3}{3} \\]\n   \\[ a_2 = \\frac{2 + a_3}{3} \\]\n\nSubstituting \\(a_2\\) into the equation for \\(a_3\\):\n\\[ a_3 = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{2 + a_3}{3}\\right) + 34}{3} \\]\n\\[ a_3 = \\frac{\\frac{2 + a_3 + 102}{3}}{3} \\]\n\\[ a_3 = \\frac{a_3 + 104}{9} \\]\n\\[ 9a_3 = a_3 + 104 \\]\n\\[ 8a_3 = 104 \\]\n\\[ a_3 = 13 \\]\n\nUsing \\(a_3\\) to find \\(a_2\\):\n\\[ a_2 = \\frac{2 + 13}{3} = 5 \\]\n\nFinally, using \\(a_3\\) to find \\(a_5\\):\n\\[ 102 = 13 + a_5 \\]\n\\[ a_5 = 89 \\]\n\nThus, the 5th term of the sequence is \\(\\boxed{89}\\).",
