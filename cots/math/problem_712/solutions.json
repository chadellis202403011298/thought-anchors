Problem: Consider the lines \\begin{align*}\ny&=3x+5 \\\\ 2y&=4x+5 \\\\ 3y&=9x-2 \\\\ 2y&=x-3 \\\\ 4y&=x-5.\n\\end{align*}Let's say that a pair of lines is $\\emph{good}$ if the two lines are either parallel or perpendicular to each other.  Among all the pairs of lines shown, how many pairs are good? Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this problem here with five lines, and I need to figure out how many pairs of them are \"good.\" A \"good\" pair is either parallel or perpendicular. Hmm, okay, let me start by recalling what makes lines parallel or perpendicular.\n\nFirst, I remember that the slope of a line is really important for determining if it's parallel or perpendicular. Two lines are parallel if they have the same slope, and they're perpendicular if the product of their slopes is -1. So, my plan is to find the slopes of all five lines, and then check each pair to see if they meet either of these conditions.\n\nLet me write down the lines again to make sure I have them right:\n\n1. y = 3x + 5\n2. 2y = 4x + 5\n3. 3y = 9x - 2\n4. 2y = x - 3\n5. 4y = x - 5\n\nAlright, so I need to find the slope of each of these lines. Since they're given in different forms, I'll convert each one into slope-intercept form, which is y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept. That should make it easy to identify the slope.\n\nStarting with the first line: y = 3x + 5. That's already in slope-intercept form, so the slope (m) is 3.\n\nMoving on to the second line: 2y = 4x + 5. I'll solve for y to get it into y = mx + b form. Dividing both sides by 2, I get y = (4/2)x + (5/2), which simplifies to y = 2x + 2.5. So the slope here is 2.\n\nThird line: 3y = 9x - 2. Again, I'll solve for y. Dividing both sides by 3, I get y = (9/3)x - (2/3), which simplifies to y = 3x - 2/3. The slope here is 3.\n\nFourth line: 2y = x - 3. Solving for y, I divide both sides by 2, so y = (1/2)x - 3/2. The slope here is 1/2.\n\nFifth line: 4y = x - 5. Solving for y, I divide both sides by 4, which gives y = (1/4)x - 5/4. The slope here is 1/4.\n\nLet me list out all the slopes I found:\n\n1. Line 1: 3\n2. Line 2: 2\n3. Line 3: 3\n4. Line 4: 1/2\n5. Line 5: 1/4\n\nNow, I need to check each pair of lines to see if they're either parallel or perpendicular. Since there are five lines, the number of possible pairs is C(5,2) which is 10. So, I'll go through each pair one by one.\n\nLet me list all the possible pairs:\n\n1. Line 1 & Line 2\n2. Line 1 & Line 3\n3. Line 1 & Line 4\n4. Line 1 & Line 5\n5. Line 2 & Line 3\n6. Line 2 & Line 4\n7. Line 2 & Line 5\n8. Line 3 & Line 4\n9. Line 3 & Line 5\n10. Line 4 & Line 5\n\nNow, I'll check each pair:\n\n1. **Line 1 & Line 2**: Slopes are 3 and 2. Neither are the same, nor does 3*2 = -1. So, not good.\n2. **Line 1 & Line 3**: Slopes are 3 and 3. They are the same, so they're parallel. That's a good pair.\n3. **Line 1 & Line 4**: Slopes are 3 and 1/2. 3*(1/2) = 3/2, which isn't -1. So, not good.\n4. **Line 1 & Line 5**: Slopes are 3 and 1/4. 3*(1/4) = 3/4, which isn't -1. Not good.\n5. **Line 2 & Line 3**: Slopes are 2 and 3. 2*3 = 6, which isn't -1. Not good.\n6. **Line 2 & Line 4**: Slopes are 2 and 1/2. 2*(1/2) = 1. Hmm, that's 1, not -1. So, not perpendicular. Wait, is 2 and 1/2 the same as negative reciprocal? Let me think. The negative reciprocal of 2 is -1/2, not 1/2. So, they aren't perpendicular. So, not good.\n7. **Line 2 & Line 5**: Slopes are 2 and 1/4. 2*(1/4) = 0.5, which isn't -1. Not good.\n8. **Line 3 & Line 4**: Slopes are 3 and 1/2. 3*(1/2) = 1.5, which isn't -1. Not good.\n9. **Line 3 & Line 5**: Slopes are 3 and 1/4. 3*(1/4) = 0.75, which isn't -1. Not good.\n10. **Line 4 & Line 5**: Slopes are 1/2 and 1/4. 1/2 * 1/4 = 1/8, which isn't -1. Not good.\n\nWait a minute, so the only good pair I found is Line 1 and Line 3, which are both slope 3, so they're parallel. But let me double-check because maybe I missed something.\n\nLooking back at Line 2 and Line 4: Line 2 has a slope of 2, Line 4 has a slope of 1/2. The product is 1, not -1, so they aren't perpendicular. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider if any lines are perpendicular. Let me check each slope and see if any other slope is the negative reciprocal.\n\nThe negative reciprocal of a slope m is -1/m. So, for each slope, I can check if any other slope is -1/m.\n\nLet me list each slope and compute its negative reciprocal:\n\n1. Line 1: m = 3. Negative reciprocal is -1/3. Do any other lines have slope -1/3? No, all other slopes are positive: 2, 3, 1/2, 1/4. So, no.\n\n2. Line 2: m = 2. Negative reciprocal is -1/2. Do any other lines have slope -1/2? No, the other slopes are 3, 3, 1/2, 1/4. Line 4 has 1/2, which is positive, not negative. So, no.\n\n3. Line 3: m = 3. Negative reciprocal is -1/3. As above, no other line has this slope.\n\n4. Line 4: m = 1/2. Negative reciprocal is -2. Do any other lines have slope -2? No, all other slopes are 3, 2, 3, 1/4. So, no.\n\n5. Line 5: m = 1/4. Negative reciprocal is -4. Do any other lines have slope -4? No, all other slopes are positive: 3, 2, 3, 1/2.\n\nSo, none of the lines have slopes that are negative reciprocals of each other. Therefore, there are no perpendicular pairs. The only good pair is the parallel one between Line 1 and Line 3.\n\nWait, but that seems like only one good pair. But let me check again, maybe I missed something.\n\nLooking back at the pairs:\n\n- Line 1 & Line 3: parallel, good.\n\n- Line 2 & Line 4: slopes 2 and 1/2. 2*(1/2) = 1, which isn't -1, so not perpendicular.\n\n- Line 2 & Line 5: slopes 2 and 1/4. 2*(1/4) = 0.5, not -1.\n\n- Line 3 & Line 4: 3 and 1/2. 3*(1/2) = 1.5, not -1.\n\n- Line 3 & Line 5: 3 and 1/4. 3*(1/4) = 0.75, not -1.\n\n- Line 4 & Line 5: 1/2 and 1/4. 1/2 * 1/4 = 1/8, not -1.\n\nSo, yeah, only one pair is good.\n\nWait, but let me check if I made a mistake with Line 2 and Line 4. Line 2 has slope 2, Line 4 has slope 1/2. The product is 1, which is positive, but not -1. So, they aren't perpendicular. So, that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, Line 2 and Line 5: 2 and 1/4, product is 0.5, not -1.\n\nSo, only one good pair.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me check if any other pairs are parallel. Line 1 and Line 3 have the same slope, so that's parallel. Are any others parallel?\n\nLine 2: slope 2. Any other line with slope 2? No, Line 3 has slope 3, Line 4 has 1/2, Line 5 has 1/4.\n\nLine 4: slope 1/2. Any other line with 1/2? No.\n\nLine 5: slope 1/4. Any other line with 1/4? No.\n\nSo, only Line 1 and Line 3 are parallel.\n\nTherefore, only one good pair.\n\nWait, but I think I might have missed something. Let me list all the pairs again and their slopes:\n\n1. Line1 & Line2: 3 & 2 \u2192 Not same, product \u2260 -1.\n\n2. Line1 & Line3: 3 & 3 \u2192 Same, parallel.\n\n3. Line1 & Line4: 3 & 1/2 \u2192 Product 1.5 \u2260 -1.\n\n4. Line1 & Line5: 3 & 1/4 \u2192 Product 0.75 \u2260 -1.\n\n5. Line2 & Line3: 2 & 3 \u2192 Product 6 \u2260 -1.\n\n6. Line2 & Line4: 2 & 1/2 \u2192 Product 1 \u2260 -1.\n\n7. Line2 & Line5: 2 & 1/4 \u2192 Product 0.5 \u2260 -1.\n\n8. Line3 & Line4: 3 & 1/2 \u2192 Product 1.5 \u2260 -1.\n\n9. Line3 & Line5: 3 & 1/4 \u2192 Product 0.75 \u2260 -1.\n\n10. Line4 & Line5: 1/2 & 1/4 \u2192 Product 1/8 \u2260 -1.\n\nSo, only pair 2 is good. Therefore, the answer is 1.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes I might have thought that maybe Line 2 and Line 4 could be perpendicular, but no, because their product is 1, not -1. So, they're not perpendicular.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check if any lines are perpendicular by seeing if any two lines have slopes that multiply to -1.\n\nLet me list all possible pairs and their slopes:\n\n- Line1 & Line2: 3*2=6 \u2260 -1\n\n- Line1 & Line3: 3*3=9 \u2260 -1\n\n- Line1 & Line4: 3*(1/2)=1.5 \u2260 -1\n\n- Line1 & Line5: 3*(1/4)=0.75 \u2260 -1\n\n- Line2 & Line3: 2*3=6 \u2260 -1\n\n- Line2 & Line4: 2*(1/2)=1 \u2260 -1\n\n- Line2 & Line5: 2*(1/4)=0.5 \u2260 -1\n\n- Line3 & Line4: 3*(1/2)=1.5 \u2260 -1\n\n- Line3 & Line5: 3*(1/4)=0.75 \u2260 -1\n\n- Line4 & Line5: (1/2)*(1/4)=1/8 \u2260 -1\n\nSo, none of the pairs have slopes multiplying to -1, except none. So, no perpendicular pairs.\n\nOnly parallel pair is Line1 & Line3.\n\nTherefore, total good pairs: 1.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake earlier because I thought maybe Line 2 and Line 4 could be perpendicular, but no, their product is 1, which is positive, so they're not perpendicular. So, yeah, only one good pair.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check Line 2 and Line 4 again. Line 2 has slope 2, Line 4 has slope 1/2. The product is 1, which is positive, so they're not perpendicular. So, correct, not a good pair.\n\nSo, final answer is 1 good pair.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me check if Line 4 and Line 5 are perpendicular. Line 4 has slope 1/2, Line 5 has slope 1/4. 1/2 * 1/4 = 1/8, which is not -1. So, no.\n\nSimilarly, Line 3 and Line 4: 3 * 1/2 = 1.5, not -1.\n\nLine 3 and Line 5: 3 * 1/4 = 0.75, not -1.\n\nLine 2 and Line 5: 2 * 1/4 = 0.5, not -1.\n\nSo, yeah, only Line1 & Line3 are parallel.\n\nWait, but I think I might have missed something. Let me check if any other lines are parallel.\n\nLine 2: slope 2. Any other line with slope 2? No.\n\nLine 3: slope 3. Only Line1 and Line3 have slope 3.\n\nLine 4: slope 1/2. Only Line4.\n\nLine 5: slope 1/4. Only Line5.\n\nSo, only Line1 and Line3 are parallel.\n\nTherefore, only one good pair.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes when you have multiple lines, you might have more than one pair, but in this case, it seems only one.\n\nWait, let me think again. Maybe I should consider all possible pairs again:\n\nTotal pairs: 10.\n\nGood pairs: those that are either parallel or perpendicular.\n\nFrom the slopes:\n\n- Parallel pairs: only Line1 & Line3.\n\n- Perpendicular pairs: none, as none of the slope products equal -1.\n\nTherefore, total good pairs: 1.\n\nSo, the answer is 1.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake because sometimes when you have lines with slopes m and -1/m, they're perpendicular. But in this case, all slopes are positive, so their negative reciprocals would be negative, and none of the lines have negative slopes, so there can't be any perpendicular pairs. So, that makes sense.\n\nTherefore, only one good pair.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves determining how many pairs of five given lines are either parallel or perpendicular (referred to as \"good\" pairs). \n\nTo solve this, we first find the slopes of each line by converting them into slope-intercept form (y = mx + b):\n\n1. **Line 1**: y = 3x + 5 \u2192 slope (m) = 3\n2. **Line 2**: 2y = 4x + 5 \u2192 y = 2x + 2.5 \u2192 m = 2\n3. **Line 3**: 3y = 9x - 2 \u2192 y = 3x - 2/3 \u2192 m = 3\n4. **Line 4**: 2y = x - 3 \u2192 y = (1/2)x - 3/2 \u2192 m = 1/2\n5. **Line 5**: 4y = x - 5 \u2192 y = (1/4)x - 5/4 \u2192 m = 1/4\n\nNext, we check each pair of lines to see if they are parallel (same slope) or perpendicular (product of slopes = -1):\n\n- **Line 1 & Line 3**: Both have a slope of 3 \u2192 Parallel (good pair).\n- All other pairs either have different slopes or their slopes' product does not equal -1, so they are neither parallel nor perpendicular.\n\nThus, there is only one good pair of lines.\n\n**Answer:** The number of good pairs is \\boxed{1}.",
