Problem: In order to compute the area of a particular circle, Juan first measures the length of its diameter. The actual diameter is 20 cm, but Juan's measurement has an error of up to $20\\%$. What is the largest possible percent error, in percent, in Juan's computed area of the circle? Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the largest possible percent error in Juan's computed area of the circle. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, Juan is measuring the diameter of a circle. The actual diameter is 20 cm, but his measurement could be off by up to 20%. That means his measured diameter could be either larger or smaller than 20 cm. Since we're looking for the largest possible percent error in the area, I think we need to consider both possibilities: the diameter being too big or too small. But maybe one of them will give a bigger error than the other. Hmm, let's see.\n\nI remember that the area of a circle is calculated using the formula A = \u03c0r\u00b2, where r is the radius. Since the diameter is twice the radius, if Juan measures the diameter as D, then the radius he uses would be D/2. So, his computed area would be A_computed = \u03c0*(D/2)\u00b2.\n\nNow, the actual diameter is 20 cm, so the actual radius is 10 cm, and the actual area is A_actual = \u03c0*(10)\u00b2 = 100\u03c0 cm\u00b2.\n\nJuan's measurement has an error of up to 20%. So, his measured diameter could be 20 cm plus or minus 20% of 20 cm. Let me calculate that.\n\n20% of 20 cm is 0.20 * 20 = 4 cm. So, Juan's measured diameter could be as low as 20 - 4 = 16 cm or as high as 20 + 4 = 24 cm.\n\nNow, let's compute the computed area for both cases: when the diameter is 16 cm and when it's 24 cm.\n\nFirst, if D = 16 cm:\n- Radius r = 16/2 = 8 cm\n- Computed area A_computed = \u03c0*(8)\u00b2 = 64\u03c0 cm\u00b2\n\nSecond, if D = 24 cm:\n- Radius r = 24/2 = 12 cm\n- Computed area A_computed = \u03c0*(12)\u00b2 = 144\u03c0 cm\u00b2\n\nNow, let's find the percent error for both cases. Percent error is usually calculated as (|Experimental Value - Actual Value| / Actual Value) * 100%.\n\nFirst, when D is 16 cm:\n- A_computed = 64\u03c0\n- A_actual = 100\u03c0\n- Error = |64\u03c0 - 100\u03c0| = 36\u03c0\n- Percent error = (36\u03c0 / 100\u03c0) * 100% = 36%\n\nSecond, when D is 24 cm:\n- A_computed = 144\u03c0\n- A_actual = 100\u03c0\n- Error = |144\u03c0 - 100\u03c0| = 44\u03c0\n- Percent error = (44\u03c0 / 100\u03c0) * 100% = 44%\n\nSo, when the diameter is underestimated by 20%, the area is computed as 64\u03c0, which is 36% less than the actual area. When the diameter is overestimated by 20%, the area is computed as 144\u03c0, which is 44% more than the actual area.\n\nSince we're looking for the largest possible percent error, the 44% error when the diameter is overestimated is larger than the 36% error when underestimated. Therefore, the largest possible percent error in the computed area is 44%.\n\nWait, let me make sure I did this right. Is there a way to calculate this without plugging in the numbers? Maybe using relative error and how it affects the area.\n\nI know that the relative error in the diameter is 20%, so the relative error in the radius would also be 20%, since radius is half of diameter. But area depends on radius squared, so the relative error in area would be approximately twice the relative error in radius, right? Because for small errors, the relative error in A \u2248 2*(relative error in r). But wait, that's for small errors, and 20% isn't that small, so maybe this approximation isn't accurate here.\n\nBut let me check. If the relative error in diameter is 20%, then relative error in area would be approximately 2*20% = 40%. But in our case, we got 44%, which is a bit higher. So, perhaps the approximation isn't exact, but the actual calculation shows 44%, which is a bit more than 40%. So, maybe when the error is larger, the actual relative error in area is more than twice the diameter error.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of percentage change. If the diameter increases by 20%, the radius also increases by 20%, so the area, which is proportional to r\u00b2, would increase by (1 + 0.20)\u00b2 = 1.44, which is a 44% increase. Similarly, a 20% decrease in diameter would lead to (0.80)\u00b2 = 0.64, a 36% decrease. So, that matches what I calculated earlier.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible percent error in the computed area is 44%.\n</think>\n\nThe largest possible percent error in Juan's computed area of the circle is 44%.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Understand the Problem:**\n   - Juan measures the diameter of a circle with an actual diameter of 20 cm.\n   - His measurement has an error of up to 20%, meaning the measured diameter could be 16 cm or 24 cm.\n   - We need to find the largest possible percent error in the computed area.\n\n2. **Calculate Actual Area:**\n   - Actual diameter = 20 cm \u21d2 Radius = 10 cm.\n   - Actual area, \\( A_{\\text{actual}} = \\pi \\times (10)^2 = 100\\pi \\) cm\u00b2.\n\n3. **Compute Areas with Measured Diameters:**\n   - **Case 1:** Measured diameter = 16 cm.\n     - Radius = 8 cm.\n     - Computed area, \\( A_1 = \\pi \\times (8)^2 = 64\\pi \\) cm\u00b2.\n   - **Case 2:** Measured diameter = 24 cm.\n     - Radius = 12 cm.\n     - Computed area, \\( A_2 = \\pi \\times (12)^2 = 144\\pi \\) cm\u00b2.\n\n4. **Calculate Percent Error for Each Case:**\n   - **Case 1:** \n     - Error = \\( |64\\pi - 100\\pi| = 36\\pi \\).\n     - Percent error = \\( (36\\pi / 100\\pi) \\times 100\\% = 36\\% \\).\n   - **Case 2:** \n     - Error = \\( |144\\pi - 100\\pi| = 44\\pi \\).\n     - Percent error = \\( (44\\pi / 100\\pi) \\times 100\\% = 44\\% \\).\n\n5. **Determine the Largest Percent Error:**\n   - The larger percent error is 44%.\n\n**Answer:** The largest possible percent error in Juan's computed area is \\boxed{44\\%}.",
