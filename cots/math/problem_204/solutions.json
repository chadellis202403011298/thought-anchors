Problem: Calculate: $(243)^{\\frac35}$ Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I need to calculate 243 raised to the power of 3/5. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that when dealing with fractional exponents, the denominator represents the root, and the numerator is the power. So, 3/5 means I first take the fifth root of 243 and then raise that result to the third power. Alternatively, I could also raise 243 to the third power first and then take the fifth root, but I think the first method might be easier here because 243 is a number I recognize from powers of 3.\n\nLet me confirm that 3 to the fifth power is 243. So, 3^1 is 3, 3^2 is 9, 3^3 is 27, 3^4 is 81, and 3^5 is 243. Yes, that's correct. So, 243 is 3^5. That should make things easier because I can rewrite 243 as 3^5 in the expression.\n\nSo, substituting that in, the expression becomes (3^5)^(3/5). Now, when you raise a power to another power, you multiply the exponents. So, 5 times 3/5 should give me the new exponent. Let me compute that: 5*(3/5) = (5*3)/5 = 15/5 = 3. So, the expression simplifies to 3^3.\n\nNow, 3^3 is straightforward. 3 multiplied by itself three times is 3*3*3. Let me calculate that: 3*3 is 9, and 9*3 is 27. So, 3^3 equals 27. Therefore, (243)^(3/5) equals 27.\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't skip any steps or make a mistake. So, starting from (243)^(3/5), I recognized that 243 is 3^5, which is correct. Then I applied the exponent rule (a^m)^n = a^(m*n), so (3^5)^(3/5) becomes 3^(5*(3/5)) which simplifies to 3^3, which is 27. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, I could have approached it by first taking the fifth root of 243. Since 243 is 3^5, the fifth root would be 3. Then, raising 3 to the third power gives me 27 as well. So, both methods lead to the same result, which reinforces that 27 is the correct answer.\n\nI don't think I made any calculation errors here. The exponents worked out neatly, and 243 being a perfect fifth power of 3 made the problem straightforward. If 243 wasn't a perfect power, I might have had to use logarithms or a calculator, but in this case, recognizing the base was key.\n\nJust to double-check, let me compute 243^(1/5) first and then cube it. The fifth root of 243 is 3 because 3^5 is 243, as I thought earlier. Then, 3 cubed is 27. Yep, that's consistent.\n\nAnother way to look at it is using logarithms. If I take the natural logarithm of 243, multiply by 3/5, and then exponentiate, I should get the same result. Let's see: ln(243) is approximately ln(3^5) which is 5*ln(3). So, ln(243) = 5*1.0986 \u2248 5.493. Then, multiply by 3/5: 5.493*(3/5) \u2248 3.296. Then, e^(3.296) is approximately e^3.296. Since e^3 is about 20.085, and e^0.296 is approximately 1.344, so multiplying those together gives 20.085*1.344 \u2248 27.0. So, that also checks out.\n\nWait, that's a bit of an approximation, but it's close enough to confirm that 27 is the correct answer. So, all methods point to 27 being the result of 243^(3/5).\n\nI think I'm confident now that the answer is 27. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and multiple approaches confirm the same result. So, I think I'm done here.\n</think>\n\nThe expression $(243)^{\\frac{3}{5}}$ can be simplified by recognizing that 243 is $3^5$. Thus, $(3^5)^{\\frac{3}{5}} = 3^{5 \\cdot \\frac{3}{5}} = 3^3 = 27$.\n\n$\\boxed{27}$",
