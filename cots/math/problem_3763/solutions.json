Problem: Let $A$ be a point on the parabola $y = x^2 - 9x + 25,$ and let $B$ be a point on the line $y = x - 8.$  Find the shortest possible distance $AB.$ Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the shortest possible distance between a point A on the parabola y = x\u00b2 - 9x + 25 and a point B on the line y = x - 8. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that the shortest distance between two points is a straight line. But in this case, one point is on a parabola and the other is on a straight line, so it's not just a simple straight line between them. Maybe I can use calculus to minimize the distance function between points A and B.\n\nLet me denote point A as (x, y) on the parabola. So, the coordinates of A would be (x, x\u00b2 - 9x + 25). Similarly, point B is on the line y = x - 8, so I can denote it as (t, t - 8), where t is some parameter.\n\nWait, but actually, if I'm looking for the shortest distance between the two curves, maybe I can think of it as minimizing the distance between point A and the line. But is that correct? Or should I consider points on both curves and find the minimum distance between any two such points?\n\nHmm, I think the latter is more accurate because both points are variable, not just the distance from a point on the parabola to the line. So, I need to find points A and B such that the distance AB is minimized.\n\nThe distance between two points (x, y) and (t, s) is given by the formula sqrt[(x - t)\u00b2 + (y - s)\u00b2]. So, in this case, the distance AB would be sqrt[(x - t)\u00b2 + (x\u00b2 - 9x + 25 - (t - 8))\u00b2]. That's a bit complicated, but maybe I can simplify it.\n\nAlternatively, since both points are variable, perhaps I can express t in terms of x or vice versa to reduce the number of variables. Let me see.\n\nWait, maybe there's a better approach. I remember that the shortest distance from a point to a line is the perpendicular distance. So, if I can find the point on the parabola where the tangent is parallel to the given line, then the distance from that point to the line might be the shortest distance.\n\nLet me check that idea. The given line is y = x - 8, which has a slope of 1. So, if the tangent to the parabola at point A has a slope of 1, then the line AB would be perpendicular to the given line, right? Because the shortest distance is along the perpendicular.\n\nWait, no, actually, if the tangent at A is parallel to the given line, then the line connecting A to B would be perpendicular to the given line, which would make it the shortest distance. Hmm, maybe I need to clarify this.\n\nWait, the given line has a slope of 1, so a line perpendicular to it would have a slope of -1. So, perhaps the line connecting A and B should have a slope of -1 if it's the shortest distance. Alternatively, maybe the tangent at A should be perpendicular to the given line, but I'm a bit confused here.\n\nWait, let me think again. The shortest distance from a point to a line is along the perpendicular. So, if I can find a point on the parabola where the tangent is perpendicular to the given line, then the distance from that point to the line would be the shortest possible distance.\n\nBut wait, the given line is y = x - 8, which has a slope of 1, so a line perpendicular to it would have a slope of -1. So, if the tangent to the parabola at point A has a slope of -1, then the line from A perpendicular to the given line would intersect the given line at point B, and that would be the shortest distance.\n\nSo, let me try that approach. First, find the derivative of the parabola to find where the slope is -1.\n\nThe parabola is y = x\u00b2 - 9x + 25. The derivative dy/dx is 2x - 9. So, setting this equal to -1 gives 2x - 9 = -1. Solving for x, I get 2x = 8, so x = 4.\n\nSo, at x = 4, the slope of the parabola is -1, which is perpendicular to the given line y = x - 8. So, the point A on the parabola at x = 4 is (4, (4)^2 - 9*4 + 25) = (4, 16 - 36 + 25) = (4, 5).\n\nNow, the line perpendicular to y = x - 8 at point A (4,5) would have the equation y - 5 = -1(x - 4), which simplifies to y = -x + 9.\n\nTo find where this perpendicular line intersects the given line y = x - 8, I can set them equal: -x + 9 = x - 8. Solving for x, I get -2x = -17, so x = 17/2 = 8.5. Then, y = (8.5) - 8 = 0.5. So, point B is at (8.5, 0.5).\n\nNow, the distance between A (4,5) and B (8.5, 0.5) can be found using the distance formula: sqrt[(8.5 - 4)^2 + (0.5 - 5)^2] = sqrt[(4.5)^2 + (-4.5)^2] = sqrt[20.25 + 20.25] = sqrt[40.5] = sqrt[81/2] = 9/sqrt(2) = (9\u221a2)/2.\n\nWait, but let me check if this is indeed the shortest distance. Alternatively, maybe I should approach this using calculus by expressing the distance as a function of x and t, then finding the minimum.\n\nLet me try that method to confirm. Let me denote point A as (x, x\u00b2 - 9x + 25) and point B as (t, t - 8). The distance squared between A and B is (x - t)^2 + (x\u00b2 - 9x + 25 - (t - 8))^2. To minimize the distance, I can minimize the distance squared, which is easier.\n\nSo, let me define D\u00b2 = (x - t)^2 + (x\u00b2 - 9x + 25 - t + 8)^2 = (x - t)^2 + (x\u00b2 - 9x + 33 - t)^2.\n\nNow, I can take partial derivatives with respect to x and t and set them to zero to find the minimum.\n\nFirst, the partial derivative with respect to t:\n\nd(D\u00b2)/dt = 2(x - t)(-1) + 2(x\u00b2 - 9x + 33 - t)(-1) = 0.\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n-2(x - t) - 2(x\u00b2 - 9x + 33 - t) = 0\n\nDivide both sides by -2:\n\n(x - t) + (x\u00b2 - 9x + 33 - t) = 0\n\nSimplify:\n\nx - t + x\u00b2 - 9x + 33 - t = 0\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nx\u00b2 - 8x + 33 - 2t = 0\n\nSo, equation (1): x\u00b2 - 8x + 33 = 2t.\n\nNow, the partial derivative with respect to x:\n\nd(D\u00b2)/dx = 2(x - t)(1) + 2(x\u00b2 - 9x + 33 - t)(2x - 9) = 0.\n\nSimplify:\n\n2(x - t) + 2(2x - 9)(x\u00b2 - 9x + 33 - t) = 0.\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\n(x - t) + (2x - 9)(x\u00b2 - 9x + 33 - t) = 0.\n\nNow, from equation (1), we have t = (x\u00b2 - 8x + 33)/2. Let me substitute this into the equation.\n\nSo, substitute t = (x\u00b2 - 8x + 33)/2 into the equation:\n\n(x - (x\u00b2 - 8x + 33)/2) + (2x - 9)(x\u00b2 - 9x + 33 - (x\u00b2 - 8x + 33)/2) = 0.\n\nLet me compute each part step by step.\n\nFirst, compute (x - t):\n\nx - t = x - (x\u00b2 - 8x + 33)/2 = [2x - x\u00b2 + 8x - 33]/2 = (-x\u00b2 + 10x - 33)/2.\n\nNext, compute the second term:\n\n(2x - 9)(x\u00b2 - 9x + 33 - t) = (2x - 9)(x\u00b2 - 9x + 33 - (x\u00b2 - 8x + 33)/2).\n\nLet me compute the expression inside the parentheses:\n\nx\u00b2 - 9x + 33 - (x\u00b2 - 8x + 33)/2 = [2(x\u00b2 - 9x + 33) - (x\u00b2 - 8x + 33)] / 2.\n\nExpanding numerator:\n\n2x\u00b2 - 18x + 66 - x\u00b2 + 8x - 33 = (2x\u00b2 - x\u00b2) + (-18x + 8x) + (66 - 33) = x\u00b2 - 10x + 33.\n\nSo, the expression becomes (x\u00b2 - 10x + 33)/2.\n\nThus, the second term is (2x - 9)*(x\u00b2 - 10x + 33)/2.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n(-x\u00b2 + 10x - 33)/2 + (2x - 9)*(x\u00b2 - 10x + 33)/2 = 0.\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to eliminate denominators:\n\n(-x\u00b2 + 10x - 33) + (2x - 9)(x\u00b2 - 10x + 33) = 0.\n\nNow, expand the product (2x - 9)(x\u00b2 - 10x + 33):\n\n= 2x*(x\u00b2 - 10x + 33) - 9*(x\u00b2 - 10x + 33)\n= 2x\u00b3 - 20x\u00b2 + 66x - 9x\u00b2 + 90x - 297\n= 2x\u00b3 - (20x\u00b2 + 9x\u00b2) + (66x + 90x) - 297\n= 2x\u00b3 - 29x\u00b2 + 156x - 297.\n\nNow, add the other term:\n\n(-x\u00b2 + 10x - 33) + (2x\u00b3 - 29x\u00b2 + 156x - 297) = 0.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n2x\u00b3 + (-x\u00b2 - 29x\u00b2) + (10x + 156x) + (-33 - 297) = 0.\n\nSimplify:\n\n2x\u00b3 - 30x\u00b2 + 166x - 330 = 0.\n\nHmm, this seems a bit complicated. Maybe I made a mistake in the expansion. Let me check:\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nFirst, when I expanded (2x - 9)(x\u00b2 - 10x + 33):\n\n2x * x\u00b2 = 2x\u00b3,\n\n2x * (-10x) = -20x\u00b2,\n\n2x * 33 = 66x,\n\n-9 * x\u00b2 = -9x\u00b2,\n\n-9 * (-10x) = +90x,\n\n-9 * 33 = -297.\n\nSo, adding up:\n\n2x\u00b3 - 20x\u00b2 + 66x -9x\u00b2 + 90x -297.\n\nSo, combining like terms:\n\n2x\u00b3,\n\n-20x\u00b2 -9x\u00b2 = -29x\u00b2,\n\n66x + 90x = 156x,\n\n-297.\n\nSo, yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, adding (-x\u00b2 + 10x - 33):\n\nSo, 2x\u00b3 - 30x\u00b2 + 166x - 330 = 0.\n\nWait, that's a cubic equation. Maybe I can factor it or find rational roots.\n\nUsing the Rational Root Theorem, possible roots are factors of 330 over factors of 2, so possible roots are \u00b11, \u00b13, \u00b15, \u00b16, etc., over 1 or 2.\n\nLet me test x=5:\n\n2*(125) - 30*(25) + 166*5 - 330 = 250 - 750 + 830 - 330.\n\nCalculating:\n\n250 - 750 = -500,\n\n-500 + 830 = 330,\n\n330 - 330 = 0.\n\nSo, x=5 is a root. Therefore, (x - 5) is a factor.\n\nNow, let's perform polynomial division or use synthetic division to factor out (x - 5).\n\nDivide 2x\u00b3 - 30x\u00b2 + 166x - 330 by (x - 5).\n\nUsing synthetic division:\n\n5 | 2  -30   166   -330\n\n           10   -100    330\n\n       ------------------\n\n         2   -20    66      0\n\nSo, the cubic factors as (x - 5)(2x\u00b2 - 20x + 66).\n\nNow, set 2x\u00b2 - 20x + 66 = 0.\n\nDivide by 2: x\u00b2 - 10x + 33 = 0.\n\nUsing quadratic formula: x = [10 \u00b1 sqrt(100 - 132)] / 2 = [10 \u00b1 sqrt(-32)] / 2.\n\nSince the discriminant is negative, there are no real roots other than x=5.\n\nSo, the only real solution is x=5.\n\nNow, from equation (1), t = (x\u00b2 - 8x + 33)/2.\n\nPlugging x=5: t = (25 - 40 + 33)/2 = (18)/2 = 9.\n\nSo, point A is (5, y), where y = 5\u00b2 - 9*5 +25 = 25 - 45 +25 = 5. So, A is (5,5).\n\nPoint B is (t, t - 8) = (9, 9 - 8) = (9,1).\n\nNow, the distance between A(5,5) and B(9,1) is sqrt[(9 -5)^2 + (1 -5)^2] = sqrt[16 + 16] = sqrt[32] = 4\u221a2.\n\nWait, but earlier when I used the perpendicular approach, I got a distance of (9\u221a2)/2, which is approximately 6.36, but this method gave me 4\u221a2, which is approximately 5.656. So, which one is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the perpendicular approach because I assumed that the tangent at A is perpendicular to the given line, but maybe that's not the correct condition. Let me check.\n\nWait, in the perpendicular approach, I found point A at (4,5) and point B at (8.5, 0.5), giving a distance of (9\u221a2)/2 \u2248 6.36. But using the calculus method, I found a point at (5,5) with a distance of 4\u221a2 \u2248 5.656, which is smaller. So, perhaps the perpendicular approach was incorrect.\n\nWait, maybe I confused the conditions. Let me think again. The shortest distance between two curves occurs where the line connecting the two points is perpendicular to both curves at those points, but in this case, one is a line and the other is a parabola.\n\nWait, actually, for the shortest distance between a point on a parabola and a line, it's when the line connecting them is perpendicular to the given line, but maybe not necessarily that the tangent to the parabola is perpendicular to the given line. So, perhaps my initial approach was wrong, and the calculus method is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the condition is that the line connecting A and B is perpendicular to the given line, which has a slope of 1, so the line AB should have a slope of -1. Let me check that.\n\nSo, if the line AB has a slope of -1, then (y_B - y_A)/(x_B - x_A) = -1.\n\nGiven that y_B = x_B - 8 and y_A = x_A\u00b2 -9x_A +25, then:\n\n(x_B -8 - (x_A\u00b2 -9x_A +25)) / (x_B - x_A) = -1.\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\nx_B -8 -x_A\u00b2 +9x_A -25 = x_B - x_A\u00b2 +9x_A -33.\n\nSo, (x_B - x_A\u00b2 +9x_A -33)/(x_B - x_A) = -1.\n\nMultiply both sides by (x_B - x_A):\n\nx_B - x_A\u00b2 +9x_A -33 = - (x_B - x_A).\n\nSimplify RHS: -x_B + x_A.\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\nx_B - x_A\u00b2 +9x_A -33 +x_B -x_A = 0.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n2x_B - x_A\u00b2 +8x_A -33 = 0.\n\nNow, solve for x_B:\n\n2x_B = x_A\u00b2 -8x_A +33,\n\nx_B = (x_A\u00b2 -8x_A +33)/2.\n\nNow, since point B is on the line y = x -8, then y_B = x_B -8.\n\nSo, the distance squared between A and B is:\n\n(x_B - x_A)^2 + (y_B - y_A)^2.\n\nSubstituting y_B = x_B -8 and y_A = x_A\u00b2 -9x_A +25,\n\n= (x_B - x_A)^2 + (x_B -8 - (x_A\u00b2 -9x_A +25))^2.\n\nBut from earlier, we have x_B = (x_A\u00b2 -8x_A +33)/2.\n\nSo, let me substitute that into the distance squared:\n\nLet me denote x_A as x for simplicity.\n\nThen, x_B = (x\u00b2 -8x +33)/2.\n\nSo, distance squared D\u00b2 = [( (x\u00b2 -8x +33)/2 ) - x]^2 + [ ( (x\u00b2 -8x +33)/2 ) -8 - (x\u00b2 -9x +25) ]^2.\n\nSimplify each term.\n\nFirst term: [(x\u00b2 -8x +33)/2 - x] = [x\u00b2 -8x +33 -2x]/2 = [x\u00b2 -10x +33]/2.\n\nSecond term inside the square:\n\n[(x\u00b2 -8x +33)/2 -8 -x\u00b2 +9x -25] = let's compute step by step.\n\nFirst, expand:\n\n(x\u00b2 -8x +33)/2 -8 -x\u00b2 +9x -25.\n\nConvert all terms to have denominator 2:\n\n= (x\u00b2 -8x +33)/2 - 16/2 - (2x\u00b2)/2 + (18x)/2 -50/2.\n\nCombine all terms:\n\n= [x\u00b2 -8x +33 -16 -2x\u00b2 +18x -50]/2\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\nx\u00b2 -2x\u00b2 = -x\u00b2,\n\n-8x +18x =10x,\n\n33 -16 -50 = -33.\n\nSo, numerator is -x\u00b2 +10x -33.\n\nThus, the second term is (-x\u00b2 +10x -33)/2.\n\nSo, D\u00b2 = [ (x\u00b2 -10x +33)/2 ]\u00b2 + [ (-x\u00b2 +10x -33)/2 ]\u00b2.\n\nNotice that both terms are squares of similar expressions, so let me compute each:\n\nFirst term squared: (x\u00b2 -10x +33)^2 /4,\n\nSecond term squared: (-x\u00b2 +10x -33)^2 /4.\n\nBut (-x\u00b2 +10x -33)^2 is same as (x\u00b2 -10x +33)^2 because squaring removes the negative.\n\nSo, D\u00b2 = [ (x\u00b2 -10x +33)^2 + (x\u00b2 -10x +33)^2 ] /4 = 2*(x\u00b2 -10x +33)^2 /4 = (x\u00b2 -10x +33)^2 /2.\n\nSo, D\u00b2 = (x\u00b2 -10x +33)^2 /2.\n\nTo minimize D\u00b2, we can minimize (x\u00b2 -10x +33)^2, which occurs when x\u00b2 -10x +33 is minimized.\n\nSo, let me find the minimum of f(x) = x\u00b2 -10x +33.\n\nThis is a quadratic function opening upwards, so its minimum occurs at x = -b/(2a) = 10/(2*1) = 5.\n\nSo, at x=5, f(x) = 25 -50 +33 = 8.\n\nThus, the minimum value of (x\u00b2 -10x +33)^2 is 8\u00b2 =64, so D\u00b2 =64/2=32, so D=\u221a32=4\u221a2.\n\nSo, the minimal distance is 4\u221a2, achieved when x=5, which gives point A as (5,5), and x_B = (25 -40 +33)/2 =18/2=9, so point B is (9,1).\n\nWait, so this matches the result from the calculus method earlier, giving the minimal distance as 4\u221a2. So, the initial perpendicular approach gave a different answer, but this seems to be correct.\n\nWait, why did the perpendicular approach give a different result? Let me check that again.\n\nIn the perpendicular approach, I found point A at (4,5) where the tangent has slope -1, which is perpendicular to the given line's slope of 1. Then, I found point B at (8.5, 0.5), giving a distance of (9\u221a2)/2 \u22486.36, which is larger than 4\u221a2\u22485.656. So, that approach must have been incorrect.\n\nPerhaps the mistake was in assuming that the tangent at A is perpendicular to the given line. Instead, the correct condition is that the line connecting A and B is perpendicular to the given line, which would have a slope of -1. But in that case, the condition is that (y_B - y_A)/(x_B - x_A) = -1, which led to the correct result when using calculus.\n\nWait, so perhaps the initial approach was wrong because I confused the condition for the minimal distance. The minimal distance occurs when the line AB is perpendicular to the given line, not necessarily when the tangent at A is perpendicular to the given line.\n\nSo, in the correct approach, we set the slope of AB to be -1, leading to the condition that (y_B - y_A)/(x_B - x_A) = -1, which, when combined with the equation of the line y = x - 8, gives the minimal distance as 4\u221a2.\n\nTherefore, the shortest possible distance AB is 4\u221a2.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe shortest possible distance \\( AB \\) is \\(\\boxed{4\\sqrt{2}}\\).\n</think>\n\nTo find the shortest possible distance between a point \\( A \\) on the parabola \\( y = x^2 - 9x + 25 \\) and a point \\( B \\) on the line \\( y = x - 8 \\), we can use calculus to minimize the distance function between points \\( A \\) and \\( B \\).\n\n1. **Define Points**:\n   - Point \\( A \\) on the parabola is \\((x, x^2 - 9x + 25)\\).\n   - Point \\( B \\) on the line is \\((t, t - 8)\\).\n\n2. **Distance Formula**:\n   The distance squared between \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) is:\n   \\[\n   D^2 = (x - t)^2 + (x^2 - 9x + 25 - (t - 8))^2\n   \\]\n\n3. **Simplify and Minimize**:\n   - Express \\( t \\) in terms of \\( x \\) using the condition that the line connecting \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) is perpendicular to the given line \\( y = x - 8 \\).
