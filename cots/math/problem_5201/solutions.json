What is the base seven sum of the digits of this product? Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I need to solve this math problem where I have to multiply two base seven numbers, 24_7 and 30_7, and then express their product in base seven. After that, I have to find the sum of the digits of this product, also in base seven. Hmm, base conversions can be tricky, but I think I can handle it by taking it step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when multiplying numbers in a different base, it's often easier to convert them to base ten, do the multiplication there, and then convert back to the original base. So, let me start by converting both 24_7 and 30_7 to base ten.\n\nStarting with 24_7. In base seven, the rightmost digit is the ones place, and the next one is the sevens place. So, the digits are 2 and 4. That means 2*7^1 + 4*7^0. Calculating that, 2*7 is 14, and 4*1 is 4. Adding those together, 14 + 4 = 18. So, 24_7 is 18 in base ten.\n\nNext, let's convert 30_7 to base ten. The digits here are 3 and 0. So, 3*7^1 + 0*7^0. That's 3*7 = 21, and 0*1 = 0. Adding them up, 21 + 0 = 21. So, 30_7 is 21 in base ten.\n\nNow, I need to multiply these two base ten numbers: 18 * 21. Let me compute that. 18 times 20 is 360, and 18 times 1 is 18, so adding those together, 360 + 18 = 378. So, the product in base ten is 378.\n\nBut wait, I think I made a mistake there. Let me double-check that multiplication because 18*21 should be 378, right? Hmm, 18*20 is indeed 360, and 18*1 is 18, so yes, adding them gives 378. So, that's correct.\n\nNow, I need to convert 378 from base ten back to base seven. To do that, I should find how many times powers of seven go into 378 and find the coefficients for each power.\n\nLet me recall that the powers of seven are:\n\n7^0 = 1\n\n7^1 = 7\n\n7^2 = 49\n\n7^3 = 343\n\n7^4 = 2401\n\nSince 7^4 is 2401, which is larger than 378, the highest power I need is 7^3, which is 343.\n\nNow, let's see how many times 343 goes into 378. 343*1 = 343, and 343*2 = 686, which is too big. So, the coefficient for 7^3 is 1.\n\nSubtracting 343 from 378 gives 378 - 343 = 35.\n\nNext, moving to the next lower power, which is 7^2 = 49. 49 goes into 35 zero times because 49 is bigger than 35. So, the coefficient for 7^2 is 0.\n\nNow, moving to 7^1 = 7. How many times does 7 go into 35? 7*5 = 35, so the coefficient is 5.\n\nFinally, for 7^0, we have 35 - (5*7) = 35 - 35 = 0, so the coefficient is 0.\n\nPutting it all together, the coefficients are 1 (for 7^3), 0 (for 7^2), 5 (for 7^1), and 0 (for 7^0). So, the number in base seven is 1 0 5 0, which is 1050_7.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my calculations again because 1050_7 seems a bit high for the product of 24_7 and 30_7. Maybe I made a mistake in the base ten multiplication or the base seven conversion.\n\nWait, 24_7 is 18, 30_7 is 21, and 18*21 is indeed 378. So, the base ten product is correct. Now, converting 378 to base seven.\n\nLet me try a different method. Instead of starting from the highest power, maybe I can find each digit step by step.\n\nStarting with the ones place: 378 divided by 7 is 54 with a remainder of 0. So, the ones digit is 0.\n\nThen, 54 divided by 7 is 7 with a remainder of 5. So, the sevens place is 5.\n\n7 divided by 7 is 1 with a remainder of 0, so the 49s place is 0.\n\n1 divided by 7 is 0 with a remainder of 1, so the 343s place is 1.\n\nPutting it together, starting from the highest power, we have 1, then 0, then 5, then 0. So, 1050_7. Hmm, that's the same result as before. So, maybe it's correct after all. Let me check if 1050_7 is indeed 378 in base ten.\n\nCalculating 1*7^3 + 0*7^2 + 5*7^1 + 0*7^0 = 343 + 0 + 35 + 0 = 378. Yes, that's correct. So, 1050_7 is the correct product.\n\nNow, the problem asks for the sum of the digits of this product in base seven. So, let's look at the digits of 1050_7: 1, 0, 5, and 0.\n\nAdding them up: 1 + 0 + 5 + 0 = 6. So, the sum of the digits is 6.\n\nWait, but the problem says to express the sum in base seven. Hmm, 6 is the same in base seven as in base ten because it's less than 7. So, the sum is 6_7, which is just 6.\n\nBut wait, I'm supposed to provide the sum in base seven, so maybe I should write it as 6_7, but since 6 is a single digit, it's the same. So, the sum is 6.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The product is 1050_7, digits are 1, 0, 5, 0. Sum is 1 + 0 + 5 + 0 = 6, which is 6 in base seven as well. So, that's correct.\n\nBut just to double-check, maybe I can try multiplying 24_7 and 30_7 directly in base seven without converting to base ten. Maybe that would be a good exercise to confirm the result.\n\nMultiplying in base seven. Let's write it out as we do in base ten.\n\n      24_7\n    x 30_7\n    --------\n\nFirst, multiply 24_7 by 0_7. That's 0_7.\n\nThen, multiply 24_7 by 3_7, but since 30_7 is 3*7^1 + 0*7^0, the 3 is in the sevens place, so it's like multiplying by 3 and then shifting one position to the left, similar to multiplying by 30 in base ten.\n\nSo, first, 24_7 * 3_7.\n\nLet me compute 24_7 * 3_7 in base seven.\n\nStarting from the right, 4*3. In base ten, that's 12. But in base seven, 12 divided by 7 is 1 with a remainder of 5. So, we write down 5 and carry over 1.\n\nNext, 2*3 = 6, plus the carryover 1 is 7. In base seven, 7 is 10, so we write down 0 and carry over 1. But since there are no more digits to multiply, we add that carried 1. So, the result is 105_7.\n\nBut wait, that's 24_7 * 3_7. Since we're multiplying by the 3 in the sevens place, we need to shift this result one position to the left, which is like multiplying by 7, so we add a zero at the end, making it 1050_7.\n\nAdding the two partial products: 0_7 (from 24_7 * 0_7) and 1050_7 (from 24_7 * 3_7 shifted left). Adding them together gives 1050_7, which matches our earlier result. So, that confirms the product is indeed 1050_7.\n\nSo, the sum of the digits is 1 + 0 + 5 + 0 = 6, which is 6 in base seven.\n\nWait, but I just thought of something. When we add the digits in base seven, do we need to consider any carries? But no, because we're just summing the digits, not performing arithmetic in base seven. So, 1 + 0 + 5 + 0 is 6, regardless of the base. So, the sum is 6, which in base seven is still 6.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 6 in base seven, which is written as 6_7, but since 6 is a single digit, it's just 6.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when we talk about digit sums, especially in different bases, people sometimes express the sum in base ten. But the problem specifically says to express the sum in base seven. So, even though 6 is the same in base ten and base seven, I should write it as 6_7 or just 6.\n\nWait, maybe I should double-check if the problem wants the sum in base ten or base seven. Let me read it again: \"the base seven sum of the digits of this product.\" So, it's the sum of the digits, which are base seven digits, but the sum itself is expressed in base seven. So, if the sum is 6, which is less than 7, it's the same in base seven. So, 6_7 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects the sum to be in base ten, but the wording says \"base seven sum,\" so I think it's 6 in base seven, which is just 6.\n\nWait, another thought: maybe I should present the sum as a base seven number, which would be 6_7, but since it's a single digit, it's just 6.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should check if the sum is correct. Let me recount the digits of 1050_7: 1, 0, 5, 0. So, 1 + 0 is 1, plus 5 is 6, plus 0 is 6. So, yes, 6 is correct.\n\nTherefore, I think I've reached the correct conclusion. The product of 24_7 and 30_7 is 1050_7, and the sum of its digits is 6 in base seven.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe base seven sum of the digits of the product is \\boxed{6}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem of multiplying the base seven numbers \\(24_7\\) and \\(30_7\\) and finding the sum of the digits of their product in base seven, we follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert \\(24_7\\) to base ten:**\n   \\[\n   24_7 = 2 \\times 7^1 + 4 \\times 7^0 = 2 \\times 7 + 4 \\times 1 = 14 + 4 = 18_{10}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Convert \\(30_7\\) to base ten:**\n   \\[\n   30_7 = 3 \\times 7^1 + 0 \\times 7^0 = 3 \\times 7 + 0 \\times 1 = 21 + 0 = 21_{10}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the base ten equivalents:**\n   \\[\n   18_{10} \\times 21_{10} = 378_{10}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Convert the product \\(378_{10}\\) back to base seven:**\n   - Divide 378 by 7: \\(378 \\div 7 = 54\\) remainder 0 (ones place)\n   - Divide 54 by 7: \\(54 \\div 7 = 7\\) remainder 5 (sevens place)\n   - Divide 7 by 7: \\(7 \\div 7 = 1\\) remainder 0 (49s place)\n   - Divide 1 by 7: \\(1 \\div 7 = 0\\) remainder 1 (343s place)\n   - Thus, \\(378_{10} = 1050_7\\)\n\n5. **Sum the digits of \\(1050_7\\):**\n   \\[\n   1 + 0 + 5 + 0 = 6\n   \\]\n\nThe sum of the digits of the product in base seven is \\(\\boxed{6}\\).",
