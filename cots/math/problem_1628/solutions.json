Problem: On the Cartesian plane in which each unit is one foot, a dog is tied to a post on the point $(4,3)$ by a $10$ foot rope. What is the greatest distance the dog can be from the origin? Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this math problem here. Let me read it again and try to understand what it's asking.\n\n\"On the Cartesian plane in which each unit is one foot, a dog is tied to a post on the point (4,3) by a 10 foot rope. What is the greatest distance the dog can be from the origin?\"\n\nAlright, so the Cartesian plane is just a regular x-y graph where each unit is a foot. The dog is tied to a post at (4,3), and the rope is 10 feet long. They're asking for the maximum distance the dog can be from the origin, which is the point (0,0).\n\nHmm, okay. So, the dog can move around in a circle with a radius of 10 feet, centered at (4,3). The question is, where on that circle is the point that's farthest from the origin?\n\nLet me visualize this. The origin is at (0,0), and the post is at (4,3). The dog can go anywhere within a 10-foot radius from (4,3). So, the farthest point from the origin would be in the direction away from the origin, right? So, if I draw a line from the origin to the post, and then extend that line beyond the post, the farthest point the dog can reach along that line would be the maximum distance.\n\nWait, but maybe I should think about this more carefully. The maximum distance from the origin would be along the line connecting the origin to the post, extended out to the edge of the dog's rope. So, the distance from the origin to the post is the straight line distance from (0,0) to (4,3). Let me calculate that first.\n\nThe distance formula is sqrt[(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2]. So, plugging in the points (0,0) and (4,3):\n\nDistance = sqrt[(4 - 0)^2 + (3 - 0)^2] = sqrt[16 + 9] = sqrt[25] = 5 feet.\n\nSo, the post is 5 feet away from the origin. The dog's rope is 10 feet long, so if the dog moves directly away from the origin along the line connecting the origin to the post, it can go an additional 10 feet beyond the post. But wait, that might not be possible because the post is already 5 feet away, and the rope is 10 feet. So, the total distance from the origin would be 5 + 10 = 15 feet.\n\nBut hold on, is that correct? Let me think again. If the post is at (4,3), which is 5 feet from the origin, and the dog is tied with a 10-foot rope, then the maximum distance the dog can be from the origin would indeed be when it's as far away as possible, which is in the same direction from the origin as the post.\n\nSo, the origin, the post, and the farthest point the dog can reach are colinear, with the post between the origin and the farthest point. Therefore, the distance from the origin to the farthest point is the distance from the origin to the post plus the length of the rope.\n\nWait, but is that always the case? What if the origin is inside the circle where the dog can move? Because the post is at (4,3), which is 5 feet from the origin, and the rope is 10 feet, so the origin is inside the circle because 5 < 10. So, in that case, the farthest point from the origin on the circle would be in the direction away from the origin, so adding the distance from the origin to the post and the rope length.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that. If the origin is inside the circle, then the farthest point from the origin on the circle would be along the line connecting the origin to the center of the circle, extended outward. So, the maximum distance would be the distance from the origin to the center plus the radius of the circle.\n\nIn this case, the center is at (4,3), which is 5 feet from the origin, and the radius is 10 feet. So, the maximum distance would be 5 + 10 = 15 feet. That seems right.\n\nBut let me make sure I'm not missing something. Is there a case where the maximum distance could be more if the origin is outside the circle? Wait, in this problem, the origin is inside the circle because the distance from the origin to the center is 5 feet, and the radius is 10 feet, so 5 < 10. So, yes, the origin is inside the circle, so the maximum distance would be the distance from the origin to the center plus the radius.\n\nWait, but let me think about another approach to confirm. Suppose I model the position of the dog as a point (x,y) such that the distance from (x,y) to (4,3) is 10 feet. So, the equation is (x - 4)^2 + (y - 3)^2 = 10^2 = 100.\n\nNow, I want to find the maximum value of the distance from (x,y) to the origin, which is sqrt(x^2 + y^2). To maximize this, I can instead maximize the square of the distance, which is x^2 + y^2.\n\nSo, I can set up the problem as maximizing x^2 + y^2 subject to the constraint (x - 4)^2 + (y - 3)^2 = 100.\n\nThis sounds like a problem that can be solved using calculus, specifically using Lagrange multipliers, but maybe there's a simpler way.\n\nAlternatively, I can parameterize the circle. Let me try that.\n\nLet me represent the circle as (x - 4) = 10 cos \u03b8, and (y - 3) = 10 sin \u03b8, where \u03b8 is the angle parameter.\n\nThen, the distance squared from the origin is x^2 + y^2.\n\nSubstituting x = 4 + 10 cos \u03b8 and y = 3 + 10 sin \u03b8, we get:\n\nx^2 + y^2 = (4 + 10 cos \u03b8)^2 + (3 + 10 sin \u03b8)^2\n\nExpanding this:\n\n= 16 + 80 cos \u03b8 + 100 cos\u00b2 \u03b8 + 9 + 60 sin \u03b8 + 100 sin\u00b2 \u03b8\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n= 16 + 9 + 80 cos \u03b8 + 60 sin \u03b8 + 100 (cos\u00b2 \u03b8 + sin\u00b2 \u03b8)\n\nSince cos\u00b2 \u03b8 + sin\u00b2 \u03b8 = 1, this simplifies to:\n\n= 25 + 80 cos \u03b8 + 60 sin \u03b8 + 100(1)\n\n= 25 + 80 cos \u03b8 + 60 sin \u03b8 + 100\n\n= 125 + 80 cos \u03b8 + 60 sin \u03b8\n\nSo, we need to find the maximum value of 125 + 80 cos \u03b8 + 60 sin \u03b8.\n\nThe maximum of A cos \u03b8 + B sin \u03b8 is sqrt(A^2 + B^2), so the maximum of 80 cos \u03b8 + 60 sin \u03b8 is sqrt(80^2 + 60^2) = sqrt(6400 + 3600) = sqrt(10000) = 100.\n\nTherefore, the maximum value of x^2 + y^2 is 125 + 100 = 225, so the maximum distance is sqrt(225) = 15 feet.\n\nWait, that's the same answer as before. So, that seems to confirm it.\n\nAlternatively, using Lagrange multipliers, let's set up the function to maximize f(x,y) = x^2 + y^2, subject to the constraint g(x,y) = (x - 4)^2 + (y - 3)^2 - 100 = 0.\n\nThe method of Lagrange multipliers says that the gradient of f is equal to \u03bb times the gradient of g at the extremum points.\n\nSo, compute the gradients:\n\n\u2207f = (2x, 2y)\n\n\u2207g = (2(x - 4), 2(y - 3))\n\nSo, \u2207f = \u03bb \u2207g gives us:\n\n2x = \u03bb * 2(x - 4)  --> x = \u03bb(x - 4)\n\n2y = \u03bb * 2(y - 3)  --> y = \u03bb(y - 3)\n\nAnd the constraint equation: (x - 4)^2 + (y - 3)^2 = 100.\n\nFrom the first equation: x = \u03bb(x - 4) --> x = \u03bb x - 4\u03bb --> x - \u03bb x = -4\u03bb --> x(1 - \u03bb) = -4\u03bb --> x = (-4\u03bb)/(1 - \u03bb)\n\nSimilarly, from the second equation: y = \u03bb(y - 3) --> y = \u03bb y - 3\u03bb --> y - \u03bb y = -3\u03bb --> y(1 - \u03bb) = -3\u03bb --> y = (-3\u03bb)/(1 - \u03bb)\n\nNow, substitute x and y into the constraint equation:\n\n(x - 4)^2 + (y - 3)^2 = 100\n\nSubstituting x = (-4\u03bb)/(1 - \u03bb) and y = (-3\u03bb)/(1 - \u03bb):\n\n[ (-4\u03bb/(1 - \u03bb)) - 4 ]^2 + [ (-3\u03bb/(1 - \u03bb)) - 3 ]^2 = 100\n\nSimplify each term:\n\nFirst term: (-4\u03bb/(1 - \u03bb) - 4) = (-4\u03bb - 4(1 - \u03bb))/(1 - \u03bb) = (-4\u03bb - 4 + 4\u03bb)/(1 - \u03bb) = (-4)/(1 - \u03bb)\n\nSecond term: (-3\u03bb/(1 - \u03bb) - 3) = (-3\u03bb - 3(1 - \u03bb))/(1 - \u03bb) = (-3\u03bb -3 + 3\u03bb)/(1 - \u03bb) = (-3)/(1 - \u03bb)\n\nSo, now the equation becomes:\n\n[ (-4)/(1 - \u03bb) ]^2 + [ (-3)/(1 - \u03bb) ]^2 = 100\n\nWhich is:\n\n(16)/(1 - \u03bb)^2 + (9)/(1 - \u03bb)^2 = 100\n\nCombine terms:\n\n(25)/(1 - \u03bb)^2 = 100\n\nSo, (1 - \u03bb)^2 = 25/100 = 1/4\n\nTaking square roots:\n\n1 - \u03bb = \u00b11/2\n\nSo, two cases:\n\nCase 1: 1 - \u03bb = 1/2 --> \u03bb = 1 - 1/2 = 1/2\n\nCase 2: 1 - \u03bb = -1/2 --> \u03bb = 1 + 1/2 = 3/2\n\nNow, let's find x and y for each case.\n\nCase 1: \u03bb = 1/2\n\nx = (-4*(1/2))/(1 - 1/2) = (-2)/(1/2) = -4\n\ny = (-3*(1/2))/(1 - 1/2) = (-3/2)/(1/2) = -3\n\nSo, point is (-4, -3)\n\nCase 2: \u03bb = 3/2\n\nx = (-4*(3/2))/(1 - 3/2) = (-6)/(-1/2) = 12\n\ny = (-3*(3/2))/(1 - 3/2) = (-9/2)/(-1/2) = 9\n\nSo, point is (12, 9)\n\nNow, let's compute the distances from the origin for both points.\n\nFor (-4, -3): sqrt[(-4)^2 + (-3)^2] = sqrt[16 + 9] = sqrt[25] = 5 feet.\n\nFor (12, 9): sqrt[12^2 + 9^2] = sqrt[144 + 81] = sqrt[225] = 15 feet.\n\nSo, the maximum distance is 15 feet, as previously found.\n\nWait, so that makes sense. The point (12,9) is in the same direction from the origin as the post (4,3), just extended out by the length of the rope. So, the distance from the origin is 5 + 10 = 15 feet.\n\nAlternatively, if I had taken the point in the opposite direction, I would have gotten (-4, -3), which is only 5 feet from the origin, so that's the minimum distance.\n\nSo, the maximum distance is indeed 15 feet.\n\nI think that's solid. Both methods, the geometric approach and the calculus approach, give the same answer, so I'm confident that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe maximum distance the dog can be from the origin is 15 feet.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Understand the Problem:**\n   - The dog is tied to a post at (4,3) with a 10-foot rope.\n   - We need to find the greatest distance the dog can be from the origin (0,0).\n\n2. **Calculate Distance from Origin to Post:**\n   - Use the distance formula: \u221a[(4-0)\u00b2 + (3-0)\u00b2] = \u221a(16 + 9) = \u221a25 = 5 feet.\n\n3. **Determine the Circle of Reach:**\n   - The dog can move anywhere within a circle of radius 10 feet centered at (4,3).\n\n4. **Find the Farthest Point from Origin:**\n   - The farthest point lies along the line connecting the origin to the post, extended by the rope length.\n   - Since the post is 5 feet from the origin, adding the rope's length gives 5 + 10 = 15 feet.\n\n5. **Verification Using Calculus:**\n   - Set up the problem to maximize the distance squared from the origin, subject to the circle equation.\n   - Using parameterization and trigonometric identities, the maximum distance squared is found to be 225, so the distance is \u221a225 = 15 feet.\n\n6. **Alternative Method with Lagrange Multipliers:**\n   - Solve for critical points using gradients, leading to the same conclusion that the maximum distance is 15 feet.\n\n**Answer:** The greatest distance the dog can be from the origin is \\boxed{15} feet.",
