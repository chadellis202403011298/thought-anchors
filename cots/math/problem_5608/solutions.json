The total amount he invested was $\\$165,\\!000$. If he invested 4.5 times as much in stocks as he did in bonds, what was his total investment in stocks? Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this math problem here about Billy Goats investing in stocks and bonds. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the total amount he invested is $165,000. And he invested 4.5 times as much in stocks as he did in bonds. I need to find out how much he invested in stocks.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. First, I should probably define some variables to represent the amounts he invested in stocks and bonds. Let me call the amount he invested in bonds as \"B\". Then, since he invested 4.5 times as much in stocks, the amount in stocks would be 4.5 times B, right? So, stocks would be 4.5B.\n\nNow, the total investment is the sum of stocks and bonds. So, that would be B (bonds) plus 4.5B (stocks). Adding those together, B + 4.5B equals 5.5B. And we know that the total is $165,000. So, 5.5B = $165,000.\n\nTo find B, I need to solve for it. So, I'll divide both sides of the equation by 5.5. That gives me B = $165,000 / 5.5. Let me calculate that. Hmm, 165 divided by 5.5... Well, 5.5 times 30 is 165, so 5.5 times 30,000 would be 165,000. So, B is $30,000.\n\nWait, let me check that again. If B is $30,000, then stocks would be 4.5 times that, which is 4.5 * 30,000. Let me compute that: 4 * 30,000 is 120,000, and 0.5 * 30,000 is 15,000. So, adding those together, 120,000 + 15,000 equals 135,000. Now, adding the bonds, which is 30,000, gives 135,000 + 30,000 = 165,000. That matches the total investment, so that seems right.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I did the division correctly. So, 165,000 divided by 5.5. Let me think of it as 165,000 divided by 5.5. I can write 5.5 as 11/2, so dividing by 5.5 is the same as multiplying by 2/11. So, 165,000 * (2/11). Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, 165,000 divided by 11. 11 times 15,000 is 165,000, right? So, 165,000 / 11 is 15,000. Then, multiply that by 2, which gives 30,000. Yep, that checks out. So, B is indeed $30,000.\n\nTherefore, the investment in stocks is 4.5 times that, which we already found to be $135,000. So, Billy invested $135,000 in stocks.\n\nWait, let me just go through the steps again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, total investment is $165,000. Let bonds be B, then stocks are 4.5B. So, total is B + 4.5B = 5.5B = 165,000. Solving for B, B = 165,000 / 5.5 = 30,000. Then, stocks are 4.5 * 30,000 = 135,000. Yep, that all adds up correctly.\n\nI think that's solid. So, the total investment in stocks is $135,000.\n</think>\n\nBilly Goats invested a total of $165,000 in stocks and bonds. Let \\( B \\) represent the amount invested in bonds. The amount invested in stocks is \\( 4.5B \\). The total investment equation is:\n\n\\[\nB + 4.5B = 165,000\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\n5.5B = 165,000\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( B \\):\n\n\\[\nB = \\frac{165,000}{5.5} = 30,000\n\\]\n\nThe investment in stocks is:\n\n\\[\n4.5 \\times 30,000 = 135,000\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** Billy's total investment in stocks was $\\boxed{135000}$.",
