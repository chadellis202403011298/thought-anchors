A circle with center $P$ on $AB$ is drawn tangent to $BC$ and $AD$. Given that $AP=\\frac mn$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers, find $m+n$.\n Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this trapezoid problem to solve, and it's a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let me first write down all the given information so I can visualize it better.\n\nWe have trapezoid \\(ABCD\\) with sides \\(AB = 92\\), \\(BC = 50\\), \\(CD = 19\\), and \\(AD = 70\\). Also, \\(AB\\) is parallel to \\(CD\\). There's a circle with center \\(P\\) on \\(AB\\) that's tangent to both \\(BC\\) and \\(AD\\). We need to find \\(AP\\) expressed as a fraction \\(\\frac{m}{n}\\) where \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are coprime, and then compute \\(m + n\\).\n\nAlright, so trapezoid \\(ABCD\\) has two sides that are parallel: \\(AB\\) and \\(CD\\). The other two sides, \\(BC\\) and \\(AD\\), are the legs of the trapezoid. Since \\(AB\\) is the longer base (92 units) and \\(CD\\) is the shorter base (19 units), the trapezoid is probably not isosceles because the legs \\(BC\\) and \\(AD\\) are of different lengths (50 and 70 units respectively).\n\nI remember that in a trapezoid, the line joining the midpoints of the legs is called the midsegment, and its length is the average of the lengths of the two bases. But I'm not sure if that's directly helpful here, but maybe it's something to keep in mind.\n\nThe problem mentions a circle centered at \\(P\\) on \\(AB\\) that is tangent to both \\(BC\\) and \\(AD\\). So, the circle is tangent to the two legs of the trapezoid. Since the center \\(P\\) is on \\(AB\\), the circle lies within the trapezoid, touching both legs. That probably means that the distances from \\(P\\) to both \\(BC\\) and \\(AD\\) are equal because the radius of the circle must be the same for both tangents.\n\nHmm, so maybe I can use the concept of equal distances from a point to two lines. In coordinate geometry, the distance from a point to a line can be found using the formula. Maybe setting up coordinate axes here would help.\n\nLet me try to assign coordinates to the trapezoid. Let's place side \\(AB\\) on the x-axis for simplicity. So, let me set point \\(A\\) at the origin \\((0, 0)\\), and point \\(B\\) at \\((92, 0)\\). Since \\(AB\\) is parallel to \\(CD\\), side \\(CD\\) will also be horizontal. Let me denote the coordinates of point \\(C\\) as \\((x, h)\\) and point \\(D\\) as \\((x + 19, h)\\), where \\(h\\) is the height of the trapezoid, and \\(x\\) is the horizontal shift from point \\(B\\) to point \\(C\\).\n\nWait, actually, if I place \\(A\\) at \\((0, 0)\\) and \\(B\\) at \\((92, 0)\\), then \\(D\\) should be somewhere above \\(A\\), but not necessarily directly above. Similarly, \\(C\\) is above \\(B\\). But since \\(CD = 19\\), which is much shorter than \\(AB = 92\\), the sides \\(AD\\) and \\(BC\\) must slope inwards.\n\nLet me think about how to find the coordinates of \\(C\\) and \\(D\\). Since \\(AD = 70\\) and \\(BC = 50\\), we can use the distance formula to set up equations.\n\nLet me denote the coordinates as follows:\n- \\(A = (0, 0)\\)\n- \\(B = (92, 0)\\)\n- \\(D = (p, h)\\)\n- \\(C = (q, h)\\)\n\nGiven that \\(CD = 19\\), the distance between \\(C\\) and \\(D\\) is 19, so \\(|q - p| = 19\\). Without loss of generality, let's assume \\(q > p\\), so \\(q = p + 19\\).\n\nNow, the length of \\(AD\\) is 70. So, the distance from \\(A\\) to \\(D\\) is:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(p - 0)^2 + (h - 0)^2} = 70\n\\]\nWhich simplifies to:\n\\[\np^2 + h^2 = 70^2 = 4900 \\quad (1)\n\\]\n\nSimilarly, the length of \\(BC\\) is 50. The distance from \\(B\\) to \\(C\\) is:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(q - 92)^2 + (h - 0)^2} = 50\n\\]\nSubstituting \\(q = p + 19\\), we have:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(p + 19 - 92)^2 + h^2} = 50\n\\]\nSimplify the expression inside the square root:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{(p - 73)^2 + h^2} = 50\n\\]\nSquaring both sides:\n\\[\n(p - 73)^2 + h^2 = 2500 \\quad (2)\n\\]\n\nNow, we have two equations:\n1. \\(p^2 + h^2 = 4900\\)\n2. \\((p - 73)^2 + h^2 = 2500\\)\n\nSubtracting equation (1) from equation (2) to eliminate \\(h^2\\):\n\\[\n(p - 73)^2 - p^2 = 2500 - 4900\n\\]\nExpanding \\((p - 73)^2\\):\n\\[\np^2 - 146p + 5329 - p^2 = -2400\n\\]\nSimplify:\n\\[\n-146p + 5329 = -2400\n\\]\nBring constants to the right:\n\\[\n-146p = -2400 - 5329 = -7729\n\\]\nDivide both sides by -146:\n\\[\np = \\frac{7729}{146}\n\\]\nLet me compute that. 146 goes into 7729 how many times?\n\n146 * 50 = 7300\n7729 - 7300 = 429\n146 * 2 = 292\n429 - 292 = 137\n146 * 0.9 \u2248 131.4\n137 - 131.4 \u2248 5.6\n\nWait, this seems messy. Maybe I made a calculation error. Let me check:\n\nWait, 146 * 50 = 7300\n\n7729 - 7300 = 429\n\n146 * 2 = 292\n\n429 - 292 = 137\n\n146 * 0.938 \u2248 137\n\nWait, 146 * 0.9 = 131.4\n\n137 - 131.4 = 5.6\n\nSo, 146 * 0.9 + 5.6 \u2248 131.4 + 5.6 = 137\n\nSo, total p \u2248 50 + 2 + 0.9 + (5.6/146) \u2248 52.9 + 0.038 \u2248 52.938\n\nWait, but maybe I can represent it as a fraction:\n\n7729 \u00f7 146.\n\nLet me compute 146 * 53 = 146*50 + 146*3 = 7300 + 438 = 7738\n\nBut 7738 is greater than 7729 by 9. So, 53 - (9/146)\n\nSo, p = 53 - 9/146 = (53*146 - 9)/146\n\nWait, that might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe I can keep it as 7729/146 and reduce the fraction.\n\nLet me check if 7729 and 146 have any common factors.\n\n146 factors: 2 * 73\n\n7729 \u00f7 73: Let's see. 73*100 = 7300, 7729 - 7300 = 429.\n\n429 \u00f7 73: 73*5 = 365, 429 - 365 = 64. So, 73*5 + 64, which is not a multiple. So, 7729 is not divisible by 73.\n\nSimilarly, 7729 \u00f7 2 is not an integer. So, 7729 and 146 share no common factors besides 1. So, p = 7729/146.\n\nAlright, so p = 7729/146.\n\nNow, let's find h^2 from equation (1):\n\np^2 + h^2 = 4900\n\nSo, h^2 = 4900 - (7729/146)^2\n\nWait, that's going to be a bit messy, but maybe I can compute it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find h in terms of p.\n\nWait, maybe I don't need the exact value of h. Let's see.\n\nWait, the problem is about finding the point P on AB such that the circle centered at P is tangent to AD and BC. So, maybe coordinate geometry can help here.\n\nLet me denote point P as (k, 0) on AB, where k is between 0 and 92. The circle centered at P is tangent to both AD and BC, so the distance from P to AD and to BC must be equal to the radius r.\n\nSo, the distance from point P(k, 0) to line AD is equal to the distance from P(k, 0) to line BC.\n\nTherefore, if I can find the equations of lines AD and BC, then I can compute the distance from P to each line and set them equal.\n\nSo, first, let me find the equations of AD and BC.\n\nWe have points:\n- A = (0, 0)\n- D = (p, h)\n- B = (92, 0)\n- C = (q, h) = (p + 19, h)\n\nSo, equation of AD: It goes from (0, 0) to (p, h). The slope is h/p.\n\nSo, equation in point-slope form is y = (h/p)x.\n\nSimilarly, equation of BC: It goes from (92, 0) to (p + 19, h). The slope is (h - 0)/(p + 19 - 92) = h/(p - 73).\n\nSo, equation of BC is y = [h/(p - 73)](x - 92).\n\nNow, the distance from point P(k, 0) to line AD and to line BC must be equal.\n\nThe formula for the distance from a point (x0, y0) to the line ax + by + c = 0 is |ax0 + by0 + c| / sqrt(a^2 + b^2).\n\nFirst, let me write equations of AD and BC in general form.\n\nEquation of AD: y = (h/p)x. Let's rearrange it to (h/p)x - y = 0. So, in general form, it's (h/p)x - y = 0.\n\nSimilarly, equation of BC: y = [h/(p - 73)](x - 92). Let's rearrange this.\n\nMultiply both sides by (p - 73):\n\ny(p - 73) = h(x - 92)\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\nh x - (p - 73) y - 92 h = 0\n\nSo, equation of BC is h x - (p - 73) y - 92 h = 0\n\nNow, compute the distance from P(k, 0) to AD and BC.\n\nDistance to AD:\n\n|(h/p)k - 0| / sqrt( (h/p)^2 + (-1)^2 ) = |(h k)/p| / sqrt( (h^2)/(p^2) + 1 )\n\nSimilarly, distance to BC:\n\n|h*k - (p - 73)*0 - 92 h| / sqrt( h^2 + (p - 73)^2 )\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nDistance to BC:\n\n| h k - 92 h | / sqrt( h^2 + (p - 73)^2 ) = | h(k - 92) | / sqrt( h^2 + (p - 73)^2 )\n\nSince both distances must be equal:\n\n| (h k)/p | / sqrt( (h^2)/(p^2) + 1 ) = | h(k - 92) | / sqrt( h^2 + (p - 73)^2 )\n\nAssuming h and p are positive (since they are lengths and coordinates), we can drop the absolute value:\n\n(h k)/p / sqrt( (h^2)/(p^2) + 1 ) = h(k - 92) / sqrt( h^2 + (p - 73)^2 )\n\nSimplify both sides by dividing by h:\n\nk / p / sqrt( (h^2)/(p^2) + 1 ) = (k - 92) / sqrt( h^2 + (p - 73)^2 )\n\nLet me square both sides to eliminate the square roots:\n\n(k / p)^2 / ( (h^2)/(p^2) + 1 ) = (k - 92)^2 / ( h^2 + (p - 73)^2 )\n\nSimplify the denominator on the left:\n\n( (h^2)/(p^2) + 1 ) = (h^2 + p^2)/p^2\n\nSo, the left side becomes:\n\n(k^2 / p^2) / ( (h^2 + p^2)/p^2 ) = k^2 / (h^2 + p^2)\n\nSo, now we have:\n\nk^2 / (h^2 + p^2) = (k - 92)^2 / ( h^2 + (p - 73)^2 )\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\nk^2 [ h^2 + (p - 73)^2 ] = (k - 92)^2 (h^2 + p^2 )\n\nNow, let's expand both sides.\n\nFirst, let's note that from earlier, we have p^2 + h^2 = 4900 (equation 1).\n\nSo, h^2 + p^2 = 4900.\n\nSimilarly, h^2 + (p - 73)^2 = h^2 + p^2 - 146 p + 5329 = 4900 - 146 p + 5329 = 4900 + 5329 - 146 p = 10229 - 146 p.\n\nSo, substituting these into the equation:\n\nk^2 (10229 - 146 p) = (k - 92)^2 (4900)\n\nNow, let's write that as:\n\nk^2 (10229 - 146 p) = (k^2 - 184 k + 92^2) * 4900\n\nCompute 92^2: 92*92 = 8464.\n\nSo, expanding the right side:\n\nk^2 * 4900 - 184 k * 4900 + 8464 * 4900\n\nNow, let's write the equation:\n\nk^2 (10229 - 146 p) - k^2 * 4900 = -184 k * 4900 + 8464 * 4900\n\nFactor out k^2 on the left:\n\nk^2 [10229 - 146 p - 4900] = -184 k * 4900 + 8464 * 4900\n\nCompute 10229 - 4900: 10229 - 4900 = 5329\n\nSo, left side becomes:\n\nk^2 (5329 - 146 p) = -184 * 4900 k + 8464 * 4900\n\nNow, let's compute the coefficients:\n\nFirst, 146 p: We know p = 7729/146, so 146 p = 7729.\n\nSo, 5329 - 146 p = 5329 - 7729 = -2400\n\nSimilarly, compute the right side:\n\n-184 * 4900 = -184 * 4900\n\nLet me compute 184 * 4900:\n\n184 * 4900 = 184 * 49 * 100 = (184 * 49) * 100\n\nCompute 184 * 49:\n\n184 * 50 = 9200\n\nSubtract 184: 9200 - 184 = 9016\n\nSo, 184 * 49 = 9016, so 184 * 4900 = 9016 * 100 = 901,600\n\nSo, -184 * 4900 = -901,600\n\nSimilarly, 8464 * 4900:\n\n8464 * 4900 = 8464 * 49 * 100\n\nCompute 8464 * 49:\n\nCompute 8464 * 50 = 423,200\n\nSubtract 8464: 423,200 - 8,464 = 414,736\n\nSo, 8464 * 49 = 414,736\n\nThus, 8464 * 4900 = 414,736 * 100 = 41,473,600\n\nSo, the right side is:\n\n-901,600 k + 41,473,600\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nLeft side: k^2 (-2400) = Right side: -901,600 k + 41,473,600\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n-2400 k^2 = -901,600 k + 41,473,600\n\nMultiply both sides by -1 to make it positive:\n\n2400 k^2 = 901,600 k - 41,473,600\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n2400 k^2 - 901,600 k + 41,473,600 = 0\n\nDivide both sides by 40 to simplify:\n\n2400 / 40 = 60\n\n901,600 / 40 = 22,540\n\n41,473,600 / 40 = 1,036,840\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n60 k^2 - 22,540 k + 1,036,840 = 0\n\nLet me check if I can divide further. Let's see if 60, 22,540, and 1,036,840 have a common factor.\n\n60 factors: 2^2 * 3 * 5\n\n22,540: ends with 40, so divisible by 20. 22,540 / 20 = 1,127. 1,127 is prime? Let me check: 1,127 \u00f7 7 = 161, which is 7*23. So, 22,540 = 20 * 7 * 161. Hmm, not sure if that's helpful.\n\nSimilarly, 1,036,840 \u00f7 20 = 51,842. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe divide by 20:\n\n60 / 20 = 3\n\n22,540 / 20 = 1,127\n\n1,036,840 / 20 = 51,842\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n3 k^2 - 1,127 k + 51,842 = 0\n\nLet me check if 3, 1,127, and 51,842 have any common factors.\n\n3 is prime. 1,127 \u00f7 3 = 375.666, not integer. 51,842 \u00f7 3 = 17,280.666, not integer. So, can't reduce further.\n\nSo, quadratic equation: 3 k^2 - 1,127 k + 51,842 = 0\n\nWe can solve for k using the quadratic formula:\n\nk = [1,127 \u00b1 sqrt(1,127^2 - 4 * 3 * 51,842)] / (2 * 3)\n\nCompute discriminant D:\n\nD = 1,127^2 - 4 * 3 * 51,842\n\nFirst, compute 1,127^2:\n\n1,127 * 1,127\n\nLet me compute step by step:\n\n1,127 * 1,000 = 1,127,000\n\n1,127 * 100 = 112,700\n\n1,127 * 27 = let's compute 1,127 * 20 = 22,540; 1,127 * 7 = 7,889; total = 22,540 + 7,889 = 30,429\n\nSo, total 1,127^2 = 1,127,000 + 112,700 + 30,429 = 1,127,000 + 143,129 = 1,270,129\n\nNow, compute 4 * 3 * 51,842 = 12 * 51,842\n\nCompute 51,842 * 10 = 518,420\n\n51,842 * 2 = 103,684\n\nSo, 518,420 + 103,684 = 622,104\n\nThus, D = 1,270,129 - 622,104 = 648,025\n\nNow, sqrt(648,025). Let's see, 805^2 = 648,025 because 800^2 = 640,000, and 805^2 = (800 + 5)^2 = 800^2 + 2*800*5 + 5^2 = 640,000 + 8,000 + 25 = 648,025. Yes, so sqrt(D) = 805.\n\nTherefore, k = [1,127 \u00b1 805] / 6\n\nCompute both possibilities:\n\nFirst, k = (1,127 + 805)/6 = 1,932 / 6 = 322\n\nSecond, k = (1,127 - 805)/6 = 322 / 6 \u2248 53.666...\n\nBut AB is only 92 units long, so k must be between 0 and 92. 322 is way beyond 92, so that solution is extraneous. Therefore, the valid solution is k = 322 / 6 = 161 / 3 \u2248 53.666...\n\nWait, 322 divided by 6: 6*53 = 318, so 322 - 318 = 4, so 53 and 4/6, which simplifies to 53 and 2/3, or 161/3.\n\nSo, AP = k = 161/3.\n\nWait, but let me verify because I feel like I might have made a mistake in the quadratic equation. Let me double-check the discriminant and the calculations.\n\nWait, earlier when I computed D = 1,270,129 - 622,104, that's correct because 1,270,129 minus 600,000 is 670,129, then minus 22,104 gives 648,025. Then sqrt(648,025) is indeed 805 because 805^2 is 648,025.\n\nThen, k = [1,127 \u00b1 805]/6. So, 1,127 + 805 = 1,932, which divided by 6 is 322, which is way beyond AB's length of 92. So, that can't be. The other solution is 1,127 - 805 = 322, which is 322/6, which is 53.666..., which is 161/3. That seems reasonable because 161/3 is approximately 53.666, which is less than 92.\n\nWait, but 161/3 is approximately 53.666, so AP = 161/3, which is 53 and 2/3. But let me check if that makes sense in the context of the trapezoid.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The quadratic equation was 3k^2 - 1,127k + 51,842 = 0, leading to solutions k = [1,127 \u00b1 805]/6. So, 1,127 - 805 = 322, so 322/6 = 53.666..., which is 161/3, which is correct.\n\nWait, but let me confirm if I didn't make any mistake in the setup earlier. Let me go back through the steps.\n\nWe had the distances from P(k, 0) to AD and BC equal, leading to the equation:\n\nk^2 / (h^2 + p^2) = (k - 92)^2 / (h^2 + (p - 73)^2 )\n\nThen, substituting h^2 + p^2 = 4900 and h^2 + (p - 73)^2 = 10229 - 146p, which became 10229 - 7729 = 2400? Wait, wait, wait. Wait, earlier when I computed h^2 + (p - 73)^2, I had:\n\nh^2 + (p - 73)^2 = h^2 + p^2 - 146p + 5329 = 4900 - 146p + 5329 = 4900 + 5329 - 146p = 10229 - 146p.\n\nBut then, when I substituted p = 7729/146, which is 53 - 9/146, then 146p = 7729, so 10229 - 146p = 10229 - 7729 = 2400. So, that part is correct.\n\nThen, the equation became k^2 * 2400 = (k - 92)^2 * 4900, but wait, no, actually, the equation was k^2 (10229 - 146 p) = (k - 92)^2 * 4900, which became k^2 * 2400 = (k - 92)^2 * 4900. Wait, but earlier, I think I might have miscalculated that step.\n\nWait, let me go back to the equation:\n\nAfter substituting, we had:\n\nk^2 (10229 - 146 p) = (k - 92)^2 * 4900\n\nBut 10229 - 146 p = 2400, so the equation becomes:\n\nk^2 * 2400 = (k - 92)^2 * 4900\n\nWait, so maybe I made a mistake earlier by expanding further. Let me try solving it this way.\n\nSo, from:\n\nk^2 * 2400 = (k - 92)^2 * 4900\n\nDivide both sides by 100:\n\nk^2 * 24 = (k - 92)^2 * 49\n\nNow, let's write this as:\n\n24 k^2 = 49 (k^2 - 184 k + 92^2 )\n\nExpanding the right side:\n\n24 k^2 = 49 k^2 - 49 * 184 k + 49 * 8464\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n24 k^2 - 49 k^2 + 49 * 184 k - 49 * 8464 = 0\n\nSimplify:\n\n-25 k^2 + 9,016 k - 414,736 = 0\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\n25 k^2 - 9,016 k + 414,736 = 0\n\nNow, let's solve this quadratic equation.\n\nCompute discriminant D:\n\nD = (9,016)^2 - 4 * 25 * 414,736\n\nCompute 9,016^2:\n\nLet me compute 9,000^2 = 81,000,000\n\nThen, (9,000 + 16)^2 = 9,000^2 + 2*9,000*16 + 16^2 = 81,000,000 + 288,000 + 256 = 81,288,256\n\nNow, compute 4 * 25 * 414,736 = 100 * 414,736 = 41,473,600\n\nSo, D = 81,288,256 - 41,473,600 = 39,814,656\n\nNow, sqrt(39,814,656). Let's see, 6,300^2 = 39,690,000. 6,300^2 = 39,690,000, so 6,300^2 + 124,656 = 39,814,656. Let me check 6,312^2:\n\nCompute 6,312 * 6,312:\n\nLet me compute 6,300^2 = 39,690,000\n\nThen, 2*6,300*12 = 2*75,600 = 151,200\n\nThen, 12^2 = 144\n\nSo, total 39,690,000 + 151,200 + 144 = 39,841,344\n\nWait, that's more than 39,814,656. Hmm, maybe 6,308^2:\n\nCompute 6,300^2 = 39,690,000\n\n2*6,300*8 = 2*50,400 = 100,800\n\n8^2 = 64\n\nSo, 39,690,000 + 100,800 + 64 = 39,790,864\n\nStill less than 39,814,656. The difference is 39,814,656 - 39,790,864 = 23,792.\n\nLet me try 6,308 + x, where x is such that (6,308 + x)^2 \u2248 39,814,656.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation. Alternatively, maybe sqrt(39,814,656) = 6,308. Let me check 6,308^2:\n\nCompute 6,300^2 = 39,690,000\n\n2*6,300*8 = 100,800\n\n8^2 = 64\n\nSo, 39,690,000 + 100,800 = 39,790,800 + 64 = 39,790,864.\n\nHmm, which is less than 39,814,656.\n\nWait, so perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Alternatively, maybe the quadratic equation approach is getting too messy, and perhaps a different method would be better.\n\nWait, maybe I can use coordinate geometry but place the trapezoid differently or use similar triangles.\n\nWait, since the circle is tangent to both AD and BC, and its center P lies on AB, maybe the point P is such that the angles from P to the points of tangency on AD and BC are equal, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the concept of homothety or harmonic division, but I might not remember all the details.\n\nWait, perhaps I can consider the problem as finding a point P on AB such that the distances from P to AD and BC are equal. So, maybe P lies on the angle bisector of the angle formed by AD and BC, but since AB is a straight line, it's more like the intersection point of the bisectors.\n\nWait, but in a trapezoid, the angle bisectors of the legs might meet at some point, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the formula for the distance from a point to a line, as I did earlier, is the right approach, but I must have made a miscalculation somewhere.\n\nWait, let me check my earlier steps again.\n\nWait, when I set up the equations for the distances from P(k, 0) to AD and BC, I arrived at an equation that led me to a quadratic equation, which gave me k = 161/3, which is approximately 53.666, which is less than 92,",
