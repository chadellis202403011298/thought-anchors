Problem: Let $\\mathbf{u},$ $\\mathbf{v},$ and $\\mathbf{w}$ be vectors such that $\\|\\mathbf{u}\\| = 3,$ $\\|\\mathbf{v}\\| = 4,$ and $\\|\\mathbf{w}\\| = 5,$ and\n\\[\\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{v} + \\mathbf{w} = \\mathbf{0}.\\]Compute $\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{v} + \\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{w} + \\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{w}.$ Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this vector problem here. Let me read it again and try to understand what it's asking.\n\nWe have three vectors: u, v, and w. Their magnitudes are given as ||u|| = 3, ||v|| = 4, and ||w|| = 5. Also, it's given that u + v + w = 0. The problem is asking me to compute the sum of their dot products: u\u00b7v + u\u00b7w + v\u00b7w.\n\nHmm, okay. So, I need to find u\u00b7v + u\u00b7w + v\u00b7w. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nI remember that when dealing with vectors and their sums, sometimes squaring both sides can help, especially when dealing with dot products because the square of a vector's magnitude can be expressed as the dot product of the vector with itself.\n\nGiven that u + v + w = 0, maybe I can square both sides of this equation. Let me try that.\n\nSo, if I square both sides, I get:\n\n(u + v + w) \u00b7 (u + v + w) = 0 \u00b7 0\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n(u + v + w) \u00b7 (u + v + w) = 0\n\nExpanding the left side using the distributive property of dot products:\n\nu\u00b7u + u\u00b7v + u\u00b7w + v\u00b7u + v\u00b7v + v\u00b7w + w\u00b7u + w\u00b7v + w\u00b7w = 0\n\nNow, I know that the dot product is commutative, so u\u00b7v = v\u00b7u, and similarly for the others. So, I can combine like terms:\n\nu\u00b7u + v\u00b7v + w\u00b7w + 2(u\u00b7v + u\u00b7w + v\u00b7w) = 0\n\nThat's because each cross term appears twice. So, for example, u\u00b7v and v\u00b7u are both present, so together they add up to 2(u\u00b7v), and similarly for the others.\n\nNow, let me write this out:\n\n||u||\u00b2 + ||v||\u00b2 + ||w||\u00b2 + 2(u\u00b7v + u\u00b7w + v\u00b7w) = 0\n\nI know the magnitudes of each vector, so I can plug those in:\n\n||u||\u00b2 is 3\u00b2 = 9,\n\n||v||\u00b2 is 4\u00b2 = 16,\n\n||w||\u00b2 is 5\u00b2 = 25.\n\nSo, substituting these values in:\n\n9 + 16 + 25 + 2(u\u00b7v + u\u00b7w + v\u00b7w) = 0\n\nLet me add those numbers up:\n\n9 + 16 is 25, and 25 + 25 is 50.\n\nSo, 50 + 2(u\u00b7v + u\u00b7w + v\u00b7w) = 0\n\nNow, I can subtract 50 from both sides to isolate the term with the dot products:\n\n2(u\u00b7v + u\u00b7w + v\u00b7w) = -50\n\nThen, divide both sides by 2 to solve for the sum of the dot products:\n\nu\u00b7v + u\u00b7w + v\u00b7w = -50 / 2 = -25\n\nSo, the value of u\u00b7v + u\u00b7w + v\u00b7w is -25.\n\nWait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n1. Started by squaring both sides of u + v + w = 0, which gives (u + v + w)\u00b7(u + v + w) = 0. That seems correct.\n\n2. Expanded the left side using the distributive property, which gives all the possible dot products, including each vector dotted with itself. That step seems right.\n\n3. Recognized that the cross terms (u\u00b7v, u\u00b7w, v\u00b7w) each appear twice, so I factored that out as 2(u\u00b7v + u\u00b7w + v\u00b7w). That makes sense.\n\n4. Substituted the magnitudes squared correctly: 9, 16, and 25. Added them up to 50. That's correct.\n\n5. Then, subtracted 50 from both sides, getting 2(u\u00b7v + u\u00b7w + v\u00b7w) = -50. Divided by 2 to get -25. That all checks out.\n\nI think this is correct. So, the answer should be -25.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{-25}\n</think>\n\nGiven vectors \\(\\mathbf{u}\\), \\(\\mathbf{v}\\), and \\(\\mathbf{w}\\) with magnitudes \\(\\|\\mathbf{u}\\| = 3\\), \\(\\|\\mathbf{v}\\| = 4\\), and \\(\\|\\mathbf{w}\\| = 5\\), and the condition \\(\\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{v} + \\mathbf{w} = \\mathbf{0}\\), we need to compute \\(\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{v} + \\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{w} + \\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{w}\\).\n\nStarting by squaring both sides of the equation \\(\\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{v} + \\mathbf{w} = \\mathbf{0}\\):\n\n\\[\n(\\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{v} + \\mathbf{w}) \\cdot (\\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{v} + \\mathbf{w}) = \\mathbf{0} \\cdot \\mathbf{0}\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{v} + \\mathbf{w} \\cdot \\mathbf{w} + 2(\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{v} + \\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{w} + \\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{w}) = 0\n\\]\n\nUsing the magnitudes given, we substitute \\(\\|\\mathbf{u}\\|^2 = 9\\), \\(\\|\\mathbf{v}\\|^2 = 16\\), and \\(\\|\\mathbf{w}\\|^2 = 25\\):\n\n\\[\n9 + 16 + 25 + 2(\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{v} + \\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{w} + \\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{w}) = 0\n\\]\n\nAdding the magnitudes squared:\n\n\\[\n50 + 2(\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{v} + \\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{w} + \\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{w}) = 0\n\\]\n\nIsolating the term with the dot products:\n\n\\[\n2(\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{v} + \\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{w} + \\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{w}) = -50\n\\]\n\nDividing both sides by 2:\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{v} + \\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{w} + \\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{w} = -25\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{-25}\n\\]",
