The problem provided an Asymptote graph, but since I can't see images, I'll rely on the description and the Asymptote code to understand the graph.\n\nFirst, the Asymptote code sets up a coordinate system with the x-axis labeled as \"Year\" and the y-axis labeled as \"Millions of Dollars.\" The graph seems to have points plotted for each year starting from 1994, as indicated by the labels \"'94,\" \"'96,\" \"'98,\" \"'00,\" \"'02,\" and so on. Each tick on the x-axis represents two years because the labels go from '94, '96, '98, etc., up to '02. So, each unit on the x-axis corresponds to two years.\n\nLooking at the Asymptote code, the points are defined as follows:\n- A = (0, 9/6 * 2)\n- B = (1, 9/6 * 2.4)\n- C = (2, 9/6 * 3)\n- D = (3, 9/6 * 3.25)\n- E = (4, 9/6 * 4.2)\n- F = (5, 9/6 * 4.5)\n- G = (6, 9/6 * 4.8)\n- H = (7, 9/6 * 5.2)\n- I = (8, 9/6 * 4.75)\n- J = (9, 9/6 * 3.25)\n\nEach point is plotted at integer x-values, which correspond to even years starting from 1994. So, x=0 is 1994, x=1 is 1996, x=2 is 1998, and so on, up to x=9, which would be 2012.\n\nThe y-values are scaled by a factor of 9/6, which simplifies to 3/2 or 1.5. So, each y-unit is multiplied by 1.5 to get the actual sales in millions of dollars. For example, point A is at (0, 3) because 9/6 * 2 = 3, which means 3 million dollars.\n\nNow, I need to calculate the sales for each year and then find the year where the increase was the highest in dollar terms.\n\nLet me list out each point with their corresponding year and sales:\n\n- A: x=0 \u2192 1994, y=9/6*2 = 3 \u2192 $3 million\n- B: x=1 \u2192 1996, y=9/6*2.4 = 3.6 \u2192 $3.6 million\n- C: x=2 \u2192 1998, y=9/6*3 = 4.5 \u2192 $4.5 million\n- D: x=3 \u2192 2000, y=9/6*3.25 = 4.875 \u2192 $4.875 million\n- E: x=4 \u2192 2002, y=9/6*4.2 = 6.3 \u2192 $6.3 million\n- F: x=5 \u2192 2004, y=9/6*4.5 = 6.75 \u2192 $6.75 million\n- G: x=6 \u2192 2006, y=9/6*4.8 = 7.2 \u2192 $7.2 million\n- H: x=7 \u2192 2008, y=9/6*5.2 = 7.8 \u2192 $7.8 million\n- I: x=8 \u2192 2010, y=9/6*4.75 = 7.125 \u2192 $7.125 million\n- J: x=9 \u2192 2012, y=9/6*3.25 = 4.875 \u2192 $4.875 million\n\nWait, but the problem says \"after 1994,\" so we should consider the years starting from 1996 onwards. So, the relevant years are 1996, 1998, 2000, 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010, and 2012.\n\nNow, to find the year where the sales increased the most in dollars, I need to calculate the year-over-year increases.\n\nLet's compute the increases between each consecutive year:\n\n1. 1996 vs. 1994: From $3 million to $3.6 million. Increase = 3.6 - 3 = $0.6 million\n2. 1998 vs. 1996: From $3.6 million to $4.5 million. Increase = 4.5 - 3.6 = $0.9 million\n3. 2000 vs. 1998: From $4.5 million to $4.875 million. Increase = 4.875 - 4.5 = $0.375 million\n4. 2002 vs. 2000: From $4.875 million to $6.3 million. Increase = 6.3 - 4.875 = $1.425 million\n5. 2004 vs. 2002: From $6.3 million to $6.75 million. Increase = 6.75 - 6.3 = $0.45 million\n6. 2006 vs. 2004: From $6.75 million to $7.2 million. Increase = 7.2 - 6.75 = $0.45 million\n7. 2008 vs. 2006: From $7.2 million to $7.8 million. Increase = 7.8 - 7.2 = $0.6 million\n8. 2010 vs. 2008: From $7.8 million to $7.125 million. Increase = 7.125 - 7.8 = -$0.675 million (a decrease)\n9. 2012 vs. 2010: From $7.125 million to $4.875 million. Increase = 4.875 - 7.125 = -$2.25 million (a decrease)\n\nNow, looking at the increases:\n\n- 1996: +$0.6 million\n- 1998: +$0.9 million\n- 2000: +$0.375 million\n- 2002: +$1.425 million\n- 2004: +$0.45 million\n- 2006: +$0.45 million\n- 2008: +$0.6 million\n- 2010: -$0.675 million\n- 2012: -$2.25 million\n\nThe highest increase is in 2002, which is $1.425 million. The next highest is in 1998 with $0.9 million, followed by 1996 and 2008 with $0.6 million each, and then 2000, 2004, 2006 with lower increases. The years after 2008 show decreases.\n\nSo, the year after 1994 where sales increased the most in dollars is 2002.\n</think>\n\nThe sales increased the most in dollars from 2001 to 2002. Therefore, the year after 1994 with the highest dollar increase in sales is 2002.\n\n$\\boxed{2002}$",
