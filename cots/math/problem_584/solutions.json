Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I need to solve this equation: floor(r) + r = 12.2. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that the floor function, denoted as floor(r), gives the greatest integer less than or equal to r. So, if r is, say, 3.7, then floor(r) would be 3. \n\nAlright, so the equation is floor(r) + r = 12.2. Let me denote floor(r) as n, where n is an integer. So, n = floor(r). Then, the equation becomes n + r = 12.2. \n\nWait, if I rearrange this, then r = 12.2 - n. But since n is the floor of r, n must be less than or equal to r, and r must be less than n + 1. So, n \u2264 r < n + 1. \n\nSubstituting r from the equation, we get n \u2264 12.2 - n < n + 1. Hmm, this seems a bit tricky, but let me write it down step by step. \n\nFirst, from n \u2264 12.2 - n, let's solve for n. Adding n to both sides, we get 2n \u2264 12.2, so n \u2264 12.2 / 2, which is 6.1. Since n is an integer, n \u2264 6. \n\nNext, from 12.2 - n < n + 1, let's solve this inequality. Subtracting n from both sides, we get 12.2 - 2n < 1. Then, subtract 12.2 from both sides: -2n < -11.2. Multiplying both sides by -1 (and remembering to reverse the inequality sign), we get 2n > 11.2, so n > 5.6. \n\nSince n is an integer, and n > 5.6, the smallest integer n can be is 6. So, n must be 6. \n\nNow, plugging n = 6 back into r = 12.2 - n, we get r = 12.2 - 6 = 6.2. \n\nWait a second, let me check if this makes sense. floor(6.2) is 6, and 6 + 6.2 is indeed 12.2. That works. \n\nBut just to make sure I didn't miss anything, let me think again. If n were less than 6, say 5, then r would be 12.2 - 5 = 7.2. But floor(7.2) is 7, not 5, which contradicts our assumption that n = floor(r). So, n can't be 5. Similarly, if n were 7, then r would be 12.2 - 7 = 5.2, but floor(5.2) is 5, not 7, which again is a contradiction. So, n must be exactly 6, and r must be 6.2. \n\nI think that's the only solution. So, r is 6.2. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of \\( r \\) is \\boxed{6.2}.\n</think>\n\nLet \\( n = \\lfloor r \\rfloor \\), where \\( n \\) is an integer. The given equation is:\n\n\\[ n + r = 12.2 \\]\n\nRearranging, we get:\n\n\\[ r = 12.2 - n \\]\n\nSince \\( n \\) is the floor of \\( r \\), we know:\n\n\\[ n \\leq r < n + 1 \\]\n\nSubstituting \\( r = 12.2 - n \\) into the inequality, we get:\n\n\\[ n \\leq 12.2 - n < n + 1 \\]\n\nFirst, solving \\( n \\leq 12.2 - n \\):\n\n\\[ 2n \\leq 12.2 \\]\n\\[ n \\leq 6.1 \\]\n\nSince \\( n \\) is an integer, \\( n \\leq 6 \\).\n\nNext, solving \\( 12.2 - n < n + 1 \\):\n\n\\[ 12.2 - 2n < 1 \\]\n\\[ -2n < -11.2 \\]\n\\[ 2n > 11.2 \\]\n\\[ n > 5.6 \\]\n\nSince \\( n \\) is an integer, the smallest integer \\( n \\) can be is 6. Thus, \\( n = 6 \\).\n\nSubstituting \\( n = 6 \\) back into \\( r = 12.2 - n \\):\n\n\\[ r = 12.2 - 6 = 6.2 \\]\n\nVerifying, \\( \\lfloor 6.2 \\rfloor = 6 \\), and \\( 6 + 6.2 = 12.2 \\), which is correct.\n\nThus, the value of \\( r \\) is \\(\\boxed{6.2}\\).",
