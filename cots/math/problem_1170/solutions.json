What is the first term of the series? Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this math problem here about an infinite geometric series. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The problem says that the common ratio is 1/8 and the sum is 60. I need to find the first term of the series.\n\nHmm, first, I remember that a geometric series is a series where each term is multiplied by a common ratio to get the next term. So, if the first term is 'a', then the series goes a, ar, ar\u00b2, ar\u00b3, and so on, where 'r' is the common ratio. In this case, r is given as 1/8.\n\nNow, the problem mentions it's an infinite geometric series. I think there's a formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series, right? Let me recall. I believe it's S = a / (1 - r), where S is the sum, a is the first term, and r is the common ratio. But wait, I think this formula only works if the absolute value of r is less than 1, so that the series converges. Since r here is 1/8, which is definitely less than 1, we're good to use this formula.\n\nSo, given that S is 60 and r is 1/8, I can plug these values into the formula to solve for 'a'. Let me write that out:\n\n60 = a / (1 - 1/8)\n\nNow, let's compute the denominator first. 1 - 1/8 is equal to 7/8. So the equation becomes:\n\n60 = a / (7/8)\n\nDividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal, so a divided by (7/8) is the same as a multiplied by (8/7). So, now the equation is:\n\n60 = (8/7) * a\n\nTo solve for 'a', I need to isolate it. So, I can multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of 8/7, which is 7/8. Let's do that:\n\n60 * (7/8) = a\n\nNow, let me compute 60 multiplied by 7/8. Let me break it down. 60 divided by 8 is 7.5, and 7.5 multiplied by 7 is 52.5. Alternatively, I can compute 60 * 7 first, which is 420, and then divide by 8, which also gives me 52.5. Either way, I get 52.5.\n\nWait, but 52.5 is a decimal. Maybe I should express that as a fraction. 52.5 is the same as 52 and a half, which is 105/2. Hmm, but let me check if that's correct. 52.5 times 8/7 should give me back 60. Let me verify:\n\n52.5 * (8/7) = (52.5 * 8) / 7 = 420 / 7 = 60. Yes, that checks out.\n\nAlternatively, if I use fractions, 60 is the same as 60/1. So, 60/1 multiplied by 7/8 is (60 * 7) / (1 * 8) = 420/8. Simplifying that, 420 divided by 8 is 52.5, which again is 105/2 as a fraction.\n\nSo, the first term 'a' is 105/2 or 52.5.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes here. So, starting from the formula S = a / (1 - r), plugging in S = 60 and r = 1/8, we get 60 = a / (7/8), which becomes a = 60 * (7/8) = 52.5. That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to write the series out, the first term is 52.5, the next term is 52.5 * (1/8) = 6.5625, then 6.5625 * (1/8) = 0.8203125, and so on. Adding these up, 52.5 + 6.5625 = 59.0625, plus 0.8203125 is about 59.8828125, and so on, approaching 60 as we add more terms. That makes sense because each term is getting smaller and smaller, so the sum converges to 60.\n\nI think that's it. So, the first term is 52.5, which can be written as 105/2 in fraction form. But the problem didn't specify the form, so either should be acceptable, but maybe it's better to write it as a fraction for exactness.\n\nWait, let me check if 52.5 is correct. So, 52.5 divided by (1 - 1/8) is 52.5 / (7/8) = 52.5 * (8/7) = 60. Yes, that's correct. So, I didn't make any calculation mistakes.\n\nSo, the first term is 52.5, which is 105/2 as an improper fraction. Alternatively, 52 and a half is also correct. So, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe first term of the infinite geometric series is found using the sum formula \\( S = \\frac{a}{1 - r} \\). Plugging in \\( S = 60 \\) and \\( r = \\frac{1}{8} \\), we solve for \\( a \\):\n\n\\[\n60 = \\frac{a}{1 - \\frac{1}{8}} = \\frac{a}{\\frac{7}{8}} \\implies a = 60 \\times \\frac{7}{8} = 52.5 = \\frac{105}{2}\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** The first term is \\boxed{\\dfrac{105}{2}}.",
