What is the sum of the proper divisors of $432$? Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the sum of the proper divisors of 432. Hmm, proper divisors are numbers that divide 432 without leaving a remainder, but they can't be 432 itself. So, first, I think I should figure out all the divisors of 432 and then subtract 432 from their sum to get the sum of the proper ones.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a smarter way than listing all divisors. I remember something about prime factorization and using it to find the sum of divisors. Let me try that. So, first, I need to factorize 432 into its prime components.\n\nStarting with 2: 432 divided by 2 is 216. Then 216 divided by 2 is 108, and again by 2 is 54, and again by 2 is 27. So that's 2^4 so far. Now, 27 is 3^3 because 3 times 3 is 9, times 3 is 27. So, the prime factorization of 432 is 2^4 * 3^3.\n\nNow, the formula for the sum of divisors is (a+1)(b+1)... where a, b are the exponents in the prime factors, but actually, wait, no, that's the number of divisors. The sum of divisors is different. Let me recall the formula correctly. For a number n = p^a * q^b, the sum of its divisors is (1 + p + p^2 + ... + p^a)(1 + q + q^2 + ... + q^b). So, I can use that.\n\nSo, applying this to 432, which is 2^4 * 3^3. The sum of divisors would be (1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16) multiplied by (1 + 3 + 9 + 27). Let me compute each part separately.\n\nFirst, the sum for the 2s: 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16. Let me add them up: 1 + 2 is 3, plus 4 is 7, plus 8 is 15, plus 16 is 31. So that part is 31.\n\nNow, the sum for the 3s: 1 + 3 + 9 + 27. Adding them: 1 + 3 is 4, plus 9 is 13, plus 27 is 40. So that part is 40.\n\nNow, multiply these two sums together: 31 * 40. Hmm, 30*40 is 1200, and 1*40 is 40, so total is 1240. So, the sum of all divisors of 432 is 1240.\n\nBut wait, the problem asks for the sum of the proper divisors, which excludes 432 itself. So, I need to subtract 432 from 1240. Let's do that: 1240 - 432.\n\nHmm, 1240 minus 400 is 840, then minus 32 more is 808. So, the sum of the proper divisors is 808.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, the prime factorization: 432 divided by 2 four times gives 27, which is 3^3. So that's correct.\n\nSum for 2^4: 1+2+4+8+16=31, that's correct.\n\nSum for 3^3: 1+3+9+27=40, correct.\n\n31*40=1240, correct.\n\nSum of proper divisors: 1240 - 432=808. Hmm, that seems right.\n\nWait, just to be thorough, maybe I should list some of the divisors and see if the sum makes sense. For example, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, etc., but adding them all up manually would take too long. Alternatively, maybe I can check using another method.\n\nAlternatively, I remember that the sum of proper divisors is sometimes called the aliquot sum, and for perfect numbers, it equals the number itself. But 432 is not a perfect number, so its aliquot sum should be different. Wait, I think 432 is actually an abundant number, meaning the sum of its proper divisors is greater than the number itself. So, 808 being greater than 432 makes sense.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can compute the sum another way. Let me see, 432 is 2^4*3^3, so the number of divisors is (4+1)(3+1)=5*4=20. So, there are 20 divisors, and I'm summing all except 432. But maybe I can list some of them and check if their sum is 808.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the formula for the sum of proper divisors, which is the sum of all divisors minus the number itself. So, I think my approach was correct.\n\nWait, another thought: Maybe I can compute the sum of the proper divisors by considering the formula again. So, sum of divisors is (2^5 - 1)/(2 - 1) * (3^4 - 1)/(3 - 1). Wait, that's another way to compute the sum of a geometric series. So, for 2^4, the sum is (2^5 - 1)/(2 - 1) = 32 - 1 = 31, which matches. For 3^3, the sum is (3^4 - 1)/(3 - 1) = (81 - 1)/2 = 80/2=40, which also matches. So, 31*40=1240, correct.\n\nSubtracting 432, we get 808. So, I think that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe sum of the proper divisors of 432 is found by first determining its prime factorization, which is \\(2^4 \\times 3^3\\). Using the formula for the sum of divisors, we calculate each part and then subtract 432 to exclude it from the sum.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Prime Factorization**: \\(432 = 2^4 \\times 3^3\\).\n\n2. **Sum of Divisors for \\(2^4\\)**:\n   \\[\n   1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 31\n   \\]\n\n3. **Sum of Divisors for \\(3^3\\)**:\n   \\[\n   1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40\n   \\]\n\n4. **Total Sum of Divisors**:\n   \\[\n   31 \\times 40 = 1240\n   \\]\n\n5. **Sum of Proper Divisors**:\n   \\[\n   1240 - 432 = 808\n   \\]\n\n**Answer**: The sum of the proper divisors of 432 is \\(\\boxed{808}\\).",
