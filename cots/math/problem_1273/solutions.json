Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this equation to solve: 5 equals (x\u00b3 - 2x\u00b2 - 8x) divided by (x + 2). I need to find the sum of the x-values that satisfy this equation. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the equation is a rational expression, meaning it's a fraction where both the numerator and denominator are polynomials. The equation is 5 = (x\u00b3 - 2x\u00b2 - 8x)/(x + 2). I remember that to solve equations with fractions, it's often helpful to eliminate the denominator by multiplying both sides by the denominator. So maybe I should try that here.\n\nLet me write down the equation again:\n\n5 = (x\u00b3 - 2x\u00b2 - 8x)/(x + 2)\n\nTo get rid of the denominator, I'll multiply both sides by (x + 2):\n\n5*(x + 2) = x\u00b3 - 2x\u00b2 - 8x\n\nLet me compute the left side:\n\n5*(x + 2) = 5x + 10\n\nSo now the equation is:\n\n5x + 10 = x\u00b3 - 2x\u00b2 - 8x\n\nHmm, okay, now I need to bring all terms to one side to set the equation to zero because that's the standard form for solving polynomial equations. Let me subtract 5x and 10 from both sides:\n\n0 = x\u00b3 - 2x\u00b2 - 8x - 5x - 10\n\nSimplify the like terms:\n\n-8x - 5x is -13x, so:\n\n0 = x\u00b3 - 2x\u00b2 - 13x - 10\n\nWait, that doesn't look right. Let me check my steps again.\n\nStarting from the beginning:\n\n5 = (x\u00b3 - 2x\u00b2 - 8x)/(x + 2)\n\nMultiply both sides by (x + 2):\n\n5*(x + 2) = x\u00b3 - 2x\u00b2 - 8x\n\nWhich is:\n\n5x + 10 = x\u00b3 - 2x\u00b2 - 8x\n\nNow, subtract 5x and 10 from both sides:\n\n0 = x\u00b3 - 2x\u00b2 - 8x - 5x - 10\n\nWhich is:\n\n0 = x\u00b3 - 2x\u00b2 - 13x - 10\n\nWait, that seems correct. So the equation becomes:\n\nx\u00b3 - 2x\u00b2 - 13x - 10 = 0\n\nHmm, now I need to solve this cubic equation. Solving cubic equations can be a bit tricky, but maybe I can factor it. Let me try to find rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem. The possible rational roots are factors of the constant term divided by factors of the leading coefficient. The constant term here is -10, and the leading coefficient is 1, so possible roots are \u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b15, \u00b110.\n\nLet me test x = 1:\n\n1\u00b3 - 2*(1)\u00b2 - 13*(1) - 10 = 1 - 2 - 13 -10 = -24 \u2260 0\n\nx = -1:\n\n(-1)\u00b3 - 2*(-1)\u00b2 -13*(-1) -10 = -1 - 2 +13 -10 = 0\n\nOh, x = -1 is a root. So (x + 1) is a factor. Now, I can perform polynomial division or use synthetic division to factor out (x + 1) from the cubic.\n\nLet me use synthetic division with x = -1.\n\nSet up the coefficients: 1 (x\u00b3), -2 (x\u00b2), -13 (x), -10 (constant).\n\nBring down the 1.\n\nMultiply 1 by -1: -1. Add to next coefficient: -2 + (-1) = -3.\n\nMultiply -3 by -1: 3. Add to next coefficient: -13 + 3 = -10.\n\nMultiply -10 by -1: 10. Add to next coefficient: -10 + 10 = 0.\n\nSo the result is 1x\u00b2 - 3x -10, and the remainder is 0. So the cubic factors as:\n\n(x + 1)(x\u00b2 - 3x -10) = 0\n\nNow, set each factor equal to zero:\n\nx + 1 = 0 \u21d2 x = -1\n\nx\u00b2 - 3x -10 = 0. Let me solve this quadratic.\n\nUsing the quadratic formula: x = [3 \u00b1 sqrt(9 + 40)] / 2 = [3 \u00b1 sqrt(49)] / 2 = [3 \u00b17]/2\n\nSo the roots are:\n\n(3 + 7)/2 = 10/2 = 5\n\n(3 - 7)/2 = (-4)/2 = -2\n\nWait, so the roots are x = -1, x = 5, and x = -2.\n\nBut hold on, in the original equation, the denominator is (x + 2). So if x = -2, the denominator becomes zero, which is undefined. Therefore, x = -2 is not a valid solution. So the valid solutions are x = -1 and x = 5.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the x-values that satisfy the equation is (-1) + 5 = 4.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Did I make any mistakes in the synthetic division or factoring?\n\nStarting with the cubic equation after moving everything to one side: x\u00b3 - 2x\u00b2 -13x -10 = 0.\n\nWe found that x = -1 is a root, so we factored it as (x + 1)(x\u00b2 - 3x -10). Then, solving x\u00b2 - 3x -10 = 0 gives x = 5 and x = -2.\n\nBut x = -2 is excluded because it makes the denominator zero, so only x = -1 and x = 5 are solutions.\n\nSum is (-1) + 5 = 4.\n\nWait, but let me check if x = -2 was a root of the original equation. Plugging x = -2 into the original equation:\n\n5 = ((-2)^3 - 2*(-2)^2 -8*(-2)) / (-2 + 2) = (-8 - 8 + 16)/0 = 0/0, which is undefined. So yes, x = -2 is not a solution.\n\nSo the solutions are x = -1 and x = 5, and their sum is 4.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any other roots. The cubic was of degree 3, so it should have three roots, but one is invalid. So the other two are valid. So the sum is 4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a smarter way to approach the problem without having to factor the cubic. Let me think.\n\nThe original equation is 5 = (x\u00b3 - 2x\u00b2 -8x)/(x + 2). Maybe I can factor the numerator first.\n\nLooking at the numerator: x\u00b3 - 2x\u00b2 -8x. Let's factor out an x:\n\nx(x\u00b2 - 2x -8). Then, factor the quadratic: x\u00b2 - 2x -8. Looking for two numbers that multiply to -8 and add to -2. Those numbers are -4 and 2.\n\nSo, x\u00b2 - 2x -8 factors as (x - 4)(x + 2). So the numerator becomes x(x - 4)(x + 2).\n\nSo the equation is:\n\n5 = [x(x - 4)(x + 2)] / (x + 2)\n\nNow, since x \u2260 -2 (because denominator is zero), we can cancel (x + 2) in numerator and denominator:\n\n5 = x(x - 4)\n\nSo, 5 = x\u00b2 -4x\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\nx\u00b2 -4x -5 = 0\n\nNow, solve this quadratic equation.\n\nUsing quadratic formula: x = [4 \u00b1 sqrt(16 + 20)] / 2 = [4 \u00b1 sqrt(36)] / 2 = [4 \u00b16]/2\n\nSo the solutions are:\n\n(4 +6)/2 = 10/2 = 5\n\n(4 -6)/2 = (-2)/2 = -1\n\nSo the solutions are x = 5 and x = -1, same as before. So their sum is 5 + (-1) = 4.\n\nAh, this seems a more straightforward approach, avoiding dealing with the cubic equation. By factoring the numerator first, we can cancel the (x + 2) term, which simplifies the equation to a quadratic, making it easier to solve. This also automatically excludes x = -2 as a solution because it was canceled out, so we don't have to worry about division by zero anymore.\n\nSo, both methods lead to the same solutions: x = 5 and x = -1, and their sum is 4.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in either approach, and both lead to the same conclusion. So I'm confident the sum is 4.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe sum of the x-values is \\boxed{4}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the equation \\(5 = \\frac{x^3 - 2x^2 - 8x}{x + 2}\\), we start by eliminating the denominator. We multiply both sides by \\(x + 2\\):\n\n\\[5(x + 2) = x^3 - 2x^2 - 8x\\]\n\nSimplifying the left side:\n\n\\[5x + 10 = x^3 - 2x^2 - 8x\\]\n\nNext, we bring all terms to one side:\n\n\\[0 = x^3 - 2x^2 - 13x - 10\\]\n\nWe factor the numerator of the original equation:\n\n\\[x^3 - 2x^2 - 8x = x(x^2 - 2x - 8) = x(x - 4)(x + 2)\\]\n\nThus, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[5 = \\frac{x(x - 4)(x + 2)}{x + 2}\\]\n\nSince \\(x \\neq -2\\), we can cancel \\(x + 2\\) in the numerator and denominator:\n\n\\[5 = x(x - 4)\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[5 = x^2 - 4x\\]\n\nRearranging terms:\n\n\\[x^2 - 4x - 5 = 0\\]\n\nSolving this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \\(x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\):\n\n\\[x = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{16 + 20}}{2} = \\frac{4 \\pm 6}{2}\\]\n\nThis gives the solutions:\n\n\\[x = 5 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x = -1\\]\n\nThe sum of these x-values is:\n\n\\[5 + (-1) = 4\\]\n\nThus, the sum of the x-values is \\(\\boxed{4}\\).",
