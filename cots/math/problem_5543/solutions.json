In 1640, Fermat conjectured that all numbers $F_n$, where $n\\neq 0$, are prime. (The conjecture was later shown to be false.) What is the units digit of $F_{1000}$? Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the units digit of the Fermat number F\u2081\u2080\u2080\u2080, which is defined as F\u2099 = 2^(2^n) + 1. Hmm, Fermat numbers are known for their form, and even though Fermat thought they were all prime, we now know that's not the case. But regardless, I'm just focusing on finding the units digit of F\u2081\u2080\u2080\u2080.\n\nFirst off, the units digit is the last digit of a number. So, for example, the units digit of 123 is 3. To find the units digit of F\u2081\u2080\u2080\u2080, I need to figure out what 2^(2^1000) is modulo 10 because the units digit is equivalent to the number mod 10.\n\nWait, let me think about that again. So, F\u2081\u2080\u2080\u2080 = 2^(2^1000) + 1. So, to find the units digit, I can compute (2^(2^1000) + 1) mod 10. Which is the same as ( (2^(2^1000) mod 10) + (1 mod 10) ) mod 10. Since 1 mod 10 is 1, it simplifies to (2^(2^1000) mod 10 + 1) mod 10.\n\nSo, the key here is to find 2^(2^1000) mod 10. Once I have that, I can add 1 and take mod 10 again to get the units digit.\n\nI remember that powers of 2 cycle their units digits in a pattern. Let me recall what that pattern is. Let's compute 2^n mod 10 for n=1,2,3,4,... and see the cycle.\n\n2^1 = 2 \u2192 units digit 2\n2^2 = 4 \u2192 units digit 4\n2^3 = 8 \u2192 units digit 8\n2^4 = 16 \u2192 units digit 6\n2^5 = 32 \u2192 units digit 2\n2^6 = 64 \u2192 units digit 4\n2^7 = 128 \u2192 units digit 8\n2^8 = 256 \u2192 units digit 6\n\nSo, the pattern repeats every 4 exponents: 2, 4, 8, 6, 2, 4, 8, 6, etc. So, the cycle length is 4. That means that 2^n mod 10 cycles every 4. So, to find 2^k mod 10, we can find k mod 4, and then use that to index into the cycle.\n\nWait, but in our case, the exponent is 2^1000, which is a huge number. So, 2^(2^1000) mod 10. Let me denote k = 2^1000, so we're looking for 2^k mod 10.\n\nSince the cycle is 4, we can find k mod 4, and then 2^k mod 10 will be the same as 2^(k mod 4) mod 10, unless k mod 4 is 0, in which case it's 6, right? Because 2^4 mod 10 is 6, and 2^(4n) mod 10 is 6.\n\nWait, let me make sure. So, if k mod 4 is 1, 2^k mod 10 is 2; if it's 2, then 4; if it's 3, then 8; and if it's 0, then 6.\n\nSo, to find 2^(2^1000) mod 10, I need to find (2^1000) mod 4, because the exponent k is 2^1000, and we're looking for k mod 4.\n\nWait, but 2^1000 is a power of 2. Let's compute 2^1000 mod 4.\n\nBut wait, 2^2 = 4, which is 0 mod 4. So, any higher power of 2 beyond 2^2 will be 0 mod 4. So, 2^3 = 8 mod 4 is 0, 2^4 = 16 mod 4 is 0, and so on. So, 2^1000 is definitely 0 mod 4 because 1000 is greater than 2.\n\nTherefore, k = 2^1000 mod 4 is 0. So, 2^k mod 10 is 2^(0) mod 10, but wait, no. Wait, when k mod 4 is 0, then 2^k mod 10 is 6, as I thought earlier.\n\nWait, but hold on, 2^4 mod 10 is 6, 2^8 mod 10 is 6, and so on. So, if k is a multiple of 4, then 2^k mod 10 is 6.\n\nSo, 2^(2^1000) mod 10 is 6. Therefore, F\u2081\u2080\u2080\u2080 = 2^(2^1000) + 1, so F\u2081\u2080\u2080\u2080 mod 10 is (6 + 1) mod 10, which is 7.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, the units digit of F\u2099 is the same as F\u2099 mod 10. So, F\u2099 = 2^(2^n) + 1. So, F\u2099 mod 10 = (2^(2^n) mod 10 + 1) mod 10.\n\nThen, to compute 2^(2^n) mod 10, we note that the cycle length is 4. So, 2^k mod 10 cycles every 4. Therefore, we need to find k = 2^n mod 4.\n\nWait, but in the case of F\u2081\u2080\u2080\u2080, n is 1000, so k = 2^1000.\n\nSo, 2^1000 mod 4. Since 2^2 = 4 \u2261 0 mod 4, any higher power of 2 will also be 0 mod 4. So, 2^1000 \u2261 0 mod 4.\n\nTherefore, 2^(2^1000) mod 10 is 2^(0) mod 10? Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, when k \u2261 0 mod 4, then 2^k mod 10 is 6, not 2^0. Because 2^4 = 16 \u2261 6 mod 10, and 2^(4m) \u2261 6 mod 10 for any integer m \u2265 1.\n\nSo, if k \u2261 0 mod 4, then 2^k mod 10 is 6.\n\nSo, 2^(2^1000) mod 10 is 6. Then, F\u2081\u2080\u2080\u2080 mod 10 is (6 + 1) mod 10 = 7.\n\nWait, but let me check with smaller exponents to see if this pattern holds.\n\nFor example, let's take n=0: F\u2080 = 2^(2^0) + 1 = 2^1 + 1 = 3. Units digit is 3.\n\nn=1: F\u2081 = 2^(2^1) + 1 = 2^2 + 1 = 5. Units digit 5.\n\nn=2: F\u2082 = 2^(2^2) + 1 = 2^4 + 1 = 17. Units digit 7.\n\nn=3: F\u2083 = 2^(2^3) + 1 = 2^8 + 1 = 257. Units digit 7.\n\nWait, so F\u2082 and F\u2083 both end with 7. Let me check n=4: F\u2084 = 2^(16) + 1 = 65537. Units digit 7.\n\nHmm, so starting from n=2, the units digit is 7. So, maybe for n \u2265 2, F\u2099 ends with 7.\n\nBut let's see if that's consistent with our calculation.\n\nWait, for n=2: 2^2 = 4, so 2^(2^2) = 2^4 = 16, which mod 10 is 6, then 6 + 1 = 7.\n\nSimilarly, for n=3: 2^3 = 8, 2^8 = 256, which mod 10 is 6, so 6 + 1 = 7.\n\nn=4: 2^4 = 16, 2^16 is 65536, which mod 10 is 6, so 6 + 1 = 7.\n\nWait, so for n \u2265 2, 2^(2^n) mod 10 is 6, so F\u2099 mod 10 is 7.\n\nBut wait, let's check n=1: 2^2 = 4, which mod 10 is 4, then 4 + 1 = 5. So, units digit 5.\n\nn=0: 2^1 = 2, units digit 2 + 1 = 3.\n\nSo, seems like for n \u2265 2, F\u2099 ends with 7.\n\nBut let's go back to the problem at hand: n=1000, which is much larger than 2, so according to this pattern, F\u2081\u2080\u2080\u2080 should end with 7.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that the reasoning holds for n=1000.\n\nSo, 2^(2^1000) mod 10. As we saw, 2^k mod 10 cycles every 4. So, to find 2^k mod 10, we find k mod 4.\n\nBut k = 2^1000. So, 2^1000 mod 4. Since 2^2 = 4 \u2261 0 mod 4, any higher power of 2 will be 0 mod 4. So, 2^1000 \u2261 0 mod 4.\n\nTherefore, k \u2261 0 mod 4, so 2^k mod 10 is 6.\n\nThus, 2^(2^1000) mod 10 = 6, so F\u2081\u2080\u2080\u2080 mod 10 = 6 + 1 = 7.\n\nSo, the units digit is 7.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's any mistake in the reasoning. For example, is 2^(2^1000) mod 10 always 6 when the exponent is a multiple of 4?\n\nYes, because 2^4 = 16 \u2261 6 mod 10, and 2^(4m) = (2^4)^m \u2261 6^m mod 10. But 6^m mod 10 is always 6, because 6 * 6 = 36 \u2261 6 mod 10, and so on. So, 6^m \u2261 6 mod 10 for any m \u2265 1.\n\nTherefore, 2^(4m) \u2261 6 mod 10.\n\nSo, since 2^1000 is a multiple of 4 (as 1000 \u2265 2), then 2^(2^1000) = 2^(4m) \u2261 6 mod 10.\n\nThus, F\u2081\u2080\u2080\u2080 = 2^(2^1000) + 1 \u2261 6 + 1 = 7 mod 10.\n\nTherefore, the units digit is 7.\n\nI think that makes sense. Let me just check with another example, say n=5: F\u2085 = 2^(2^5) + 1 = 2^32 + 1. 2^32 is 4,294,967,296, which ends with 6. So, 6 + 1 = 7. Yep, units digit is 7.\n\nSo, it seems consistent. Therefore, the units digit of F\u2081\u2080\u2080\u2080 is 7.\n</think>\n\nThe units digit of F\u2081\u2080\u2080\u2080 is determined by evaluating F\u2081\u2080\u2080\u2080 mod 10. Since F\u2081\u2080\u2080\u2080 = 2^(2^1000) + 1, we find that 2^(2^1000) mod 10 cycles every 4 exponents, and since 2^1000 is a multiple of 4, 2^(2^1000) mod 10 is 6. Adding 1 gives 7, so the units digit is 7.\n\n$\\boxed{7}$",
