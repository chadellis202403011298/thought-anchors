How many lattice points lie on the hyperbola $x^2 - y^2 = 2000^2$?\n Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how many lattice points lie on the hyperbola defined by the equation \\( x^2 - y^2 = 2000^2 \\). Lattice points are points where both \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are integers, so I'm looking for all integer solutions \\( (x, y) \\) that satisfy this equation.\n\nFirst, let me understand the equation better. The hyperbola \\( x^2 - y^2 = 2000^2 \\) can be factored as \\( (x - y)(x + y) = 2000^2 \\). This factorization might be useful because it breaks down the problem into finding pairs of integers whose product is \\( 2000^2 \\), and then solving for \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) from those pairs.\n\nSo, if I let \\( a = x - y \\) and \\( b = x + y \\), then the equation becomes \\( ab = 2000^2 \\). Since \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are integers, both \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) must also be integers. Moreover, \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) must have the same parity because \\( x = \\frac{a + b}{2} \\) and \\( y = \\frac{b - a}{2} \\) must both be integers. This means that \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are either both even or both odd. However, since \\( 2000^2 \\) is an even number squared, it's actually divisible by 4, so \\( 2000^2 = (2^4 \\times 5^3)^2 = 2^8 \\times 5^6 \\). Therefore, \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) must both be even because their product is divisible by 4, and they need to have the same parity. So, both \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) must be even.\n\nNext, I need to find all pairs of integers \\( (a, b) \\) such that \\( ab = 2000^2 \\) and both \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are even. Each such pair will correspond to a unique solution \\( (x, y) \\) because \\( x = \\frac{a + b}{2} \\) and \\( y = \\frac{b - a}{2} \\). However, I should be careful to consider both positive and negative divisors since \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) can be positive or negative, which will give me different solutions.\n\nLet me start by finding all the positive divisors of \\( 2000^2 \\). Since \\( 2000 = 2^4 \\times 5^3 \\), \\( 2000^2 = 2^8 \\times 5^6 \\). The number of positive divisors is given by multiplying one more than each of the exponents in the prime factorization. So, the number of positive divisors is \\( (8 + 1) \\times (6 + 1) = 9 \\times 7 = 63 \\). Therefore, there are 63 positive divisors of \\( 2000^2 \\).\n\nSince each positive divisor \\( a \\) pairs with another positive divisor \\( b = \\frac{2000^2}{a} \\), the number of positive divisor pairs is 63. However, since each pair \\( (a, b) \\) is unique, and considering that \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) can be arranged in any order, I need to be cautious not to double-count. But in this case, since \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are positive, each pair is unique, so I can proceed.\n\nBut wait, I also need to consider negative divisors because \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) can be negative. Since \\( ab = 2000^2 \\) is positive, both \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) must be either both positive or both negative. So, for each positive divisor pair \\( (a, b) \\), there is a corresponding negative pair \\( (-a, -b) \\). Therefore, the total number of divisor pairs, considering both positive and negative, is \\( 63 \\times 2 = 126 \\).\n\nHowever, not all these divisor pairs will satisfy the condition that both \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are even. Wait, no, actually, since \\( 2000^2 \\) is divisible by 4, as I noted earlier, both \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) must be even. So, I need to find all such pairs where both \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are even. Therefore, perhaps I should adjust my approach.\n\nLet me consider that \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) must both be even. So, let me set \\( a = 2a' \\) and \\( b = 2b' \\). Then, the equation becomes \\( (2a')(2b') = 4a'b' = 2000^2 \\). Therefore, \\( a'b' = \\frac{2000^2}{4} = 1000^2 \\).\n\nSo now, I can reframe the problem as finding all pairs \\( (a', b') \\) such that \\( a'b' = 1000^2 \\), where \\( a' \\) and \\( b' \\) are integers. Then, each such pair will correspond to \\( a = 2a' \\) and \\( b = 2b' \\), which are both even, as required.\n\nNow, \\( 1000 = 2^3 \\times 5^3 \\), so \\( 1000^2 = 2^6 \\times 5^6 \\). The number of positive divisors of \\( 1000^2 \\) is \\( (6 + 1) \\times (6 + 1) = 7 \\times 7 = 49 \\). Therefore, there are 49 positive divisor pairs \\( (a', b') \\).\n\nAgain, considering both positive and negative divisors, since \\( a' \\) and \\( b' \\) must both be positive or both be negative to satisfy \\( a'b' = 1000^2 \\), we have 49 positive pairs and 49 negative pairs, totaling 98 pairs.\n\nBut wait, each pair \\( (a', b') \\) corresponds to a unique solution \\( (x, y) \\), but I need to ensure that \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are integers. Since \\( a' \\) and \\( b' \\) are integers, \\( a = 2a' \\) and \\( b = 2b' \\) are even integers, so \\( x = \\frac{a + b}{2} = \\frac{2a' + 2b'}{2} = a' + b' \\) and \\( y = \\frac{b - a}{2} = \\frac{2b' - 2a'}{2} = b' - a' \\). Both \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are integers because \\( a' \\) and \\( b' \\) are integers.\n\nTherefore, each of the 98 pairs \\( (a, b) \\) (49 positive and 49 negative) will give me a unique lattice point \\( (x, y) \\). However, I should check if these pairs lead to distinct points or if there's any overlap.\n\nWait, let me think. For each positive pair \\( (a', b') \\), I get a solution \\( (x, y) = (a' + b', b' - a') \\). For each negative pair \\( (-a', -b') \\), I get \\( x = (-a') + (-b') = -a' - b' \\) and \\( y = (-b') - (-a') = -b' + a' = a' - b' \\). So, the points are \\( (- (a' + b'), a' - b') \\). Comparing this with the positive pair solution, it's not necessarily the same as the positive solution unless \\( a' = b' \\), which would make \\( y = 0 \\) in the positive case and \\( y = 0 \\) in the negative case as well, but \\( x \\) would be \\( 2a' \\) and \\( -2a' \\). So, these are distinct points unless \\( a' = b' = 0 \\), which isn't possible here because \\( a' \\) and \\( b' \\) are divisors of \\( 1000^2 \\), so they can't be zero.\n\nTherefore, all 98 pairs lead to distinct lattice points. However, I should also consider whether each solution is unique or if some solutions are repeated. For example, if \\( (a', b') \\) and \\( (b', a') \\) lead to different points, then they should both be counted. Let me see:\n\nIf \\( (a', b') \\) gives \\( (a' + b', b' - a') \\), then \\( (b', a') \\) gives \\( (b' + a', a' - b') \\). These are different points unless \\( a' = b' \\). So, in general, each pair \\( (a', b') \\) where \\( a' \\neq b' \\) will have a distinct counterpart \\( (b', a') \\) leading to a different point. However, when \\( a' = b' \\), the point is the same as its counterpart because \\( x = 2a' \\) and \\( y = 0 \\), so swapping \\( a' \\) and \\( b' \\) doesn't change the point.\n\nTherefore, the number of distinct solutions is equal to the number of such pairs, considering both positive and negative, but I need to check if there's any overlap or if all are unique.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to consider that each divisor pair \\( (a', b') \\) with \\( a' \\leq b' \\) corresponds to a unique solution, and then account for the symmetries.\n\nBut maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me instead think about how many solutions there are in total, considering both positive and negative divisors.\n\nGiven that \\( 1000^2 \\) has 49 positive divisors, each corresponding to a unique positive pair \\( (a', b') \\), and each such pair gives a unique solution \\( (x, y) \\). Similarly, each negative pair \\( (-a', -b') \\) gives a unique solution \\( (-x, -y) \\) if \\( (x, y) \\) is from a positive pair. Wait, no, actually, as I saw earlier, the negative pairs give solutions \\( (-x, y') \\) where \\( y' = a' - b' \\), which is different from \\( y = b' - a' \\).\n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\nIf \\( (a', b') \\) is a positive pair, then \\( x = a' + b' \\) and \\( y = b' - a' \\).\n\nIf \\( (-a', -b') \\) is a negative pair, then \\( x = (-a') + (-b') = - (a' + b') \\) and \\( y = (-b') - (-a') = -b' + a' = a' - b' \\).\n\nSo, the point from the negative pair is \\( (-x, -y) \\) if \\( y = b' - a' \\). Wait, no:\n\nWait, if \\( y = b' - a' \\), then \\( -y = a' - b' \\). So, the point from the negative pair is \\( (-x, -y) \\) only if \\( y = b' - a' \\) and \\( -y = a' - b' \\). But actually, \\( y \\) can be positive or negative depending on whether \\( b' > a' \\) or not.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to consider that each positive divisor pair \\( (a', b') \\) gives a point \\( (x, y) \\), and each negative divisor pair \\( (-a', -b') \\) gives a point \\( (-x, -y) \\). So, these are distinct points unless \\( x = 0 \\) or \\( y = 0 \\).\n\nBut in our case, since \\( x^2 - y^2 = 2000^2 \\), \\( x \\) cannot be zero because \\( -y^2 = 2000^2 \\) would imply \\( y^2 = -2000^2 \\), which is impossible. Similarly, \\( y \\) can be zero, but let's see:\n\nIf \\( y = 0 \\), then \\( x^2 = 2000^2 \\), so \\( x = \\pm 2000 \\). So, the points \\( (2000, 0) \\) and \\( (-2000, 0) \\) are solutions. These would correspond to the cases where \\( a' = b' \\), because \\( y = b' - a' = 0 \\) implies \\( a' = b' \\). So, in the positive pairs, when \\( a' = b' \\), we get \\( x = 2a' \\) and \\( y = 0 \\). Similarly, in the negative pairs, when \\( a' = b' \\), we get \\( x = -2a' \\) and \\( y = 0 \\). So, these are two distinct points.\n\nTherefore, each positive divisor pair \\( (a', b') \\) gives a unique point \\( (x, y) \\), and each negative divisor pair \\( (-a', -b') \\) gives a unique point \\( (-x, -y) \\). However, when \\( a' = b' \\), \\( (-x, -y) \\) is just \\( (-x, 0) \\), which is distinct from \\( (x, 0) \\).\n\nSo, in total, the number of lattice points is twice the number of positive divisor pairs, which is \\( 2 \\times 49 = 98 \\). However, I should check if there are any other points that might be duplicates or if I'm missing something.\n\nWait, but let's think about the actual number of solutions. For each divisor \\( a' \\) of \\( 1000^2 \\), there's a corresponding \\( b' = \\frac{1000^2}{a'} \\). Each such pair \\( (a', b') \\) gives a unique solution \\( (x, y) \\). Since \\( a' \\) can range from 1 to \\( 1000^2 \\), but only the divisors are considered.\n\nBut actually, \\( a' \\) can be positive or negative, but since we've already considered both positive and negative pairs, I think the total number of solutions is indeed 98.\n\nWait, but let's test this with a smaller example to see if this approach works.\n\nSuppose I have the hyperbola \\( x^2 - y^2 = 4 \\). Then, \\( (x - y)(x + y) = 4 \\). The positive divisors of 4 are 1, 2, 4. So, the positive divisor pairs are (1,4), (2,2), (4,1). Each of these gives:\n\nFor (1,4): \\( x = (1+4)/2 = 2.5 \\), which is not integer. Wait, but this contradicts my earlier assumption because I thought setting \\( a' \\) and \\( b' \\) as even would ensure integer solutions. Wait, no, in this case, \\( 4 = 2^2 \\), so \\( a' \\) and \\( b' \\) would be such that \\( a' \\times b' = 1^2 = 1 \\). Wait, no, let's see.\n\nWait, in the original problem, I set \\( a = 2a' \\) and \\( b = 2b' \\), leading to \\( a' \\times b' = (2000^2)/4 = 1000^2 \\). So, in the smaller example, \\( x^2 - y^2 = 4 \\), then \\( a = x - y \\), \\( b = x + y \\), and \\( ab = 4 \\). So, \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) must both be even because \\( 4 \\) is divisible by 4? Wait, no, \\( 4 \\) is divisible by 4, so \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) must both be even.\n\nSo, \\( a = 2a' \\), \\( b = 2b' \\), then \\( 4a'b' = 4 \\), so \\( a'b' = 1 \\). The positive divisors of 1 are 1, so the positive pairs are (1,1). Therefore, \\( a' = 1 \\), \\( b' = 1 \\), leading to \\( a = 2 \\), \\( b = 2 \\), so \\( x = (2 + 2)/2 = 2 \\), \\( y = (2 - 2)/2 = 0 \\). Similarly, negative pairs would be (-1,-1), leading to \\( a = -2 \\), \\( b = -2 \\), so \\( x = (-2 + (-2))/2 = -2 \\), \\( y = (-2 - (-2))/2 = 0 \\). So, the solutions are (2,0) and (-2,0), which are correct.\n\nBut wait, in this case, the number of positive divisor pairs is 1, leading to 2 solutions when considering negative pairs. So, in this case, the total number of solutions is 2, which matches the actual solutions.\n\nAnother example: \\( x^2 - y^2 = 9 \\). Then, \\( ab = 9 \\). Since 9 is odd, \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) must both be odd. So, positive divisor pairs are (1,9), (3,3), (9,1). Each of these gives:\n\nFor (1,9): \\( x = (1+9)/2 = 5 \\), \\( y = (9-1)/2 = 4 \\). So, (5,4).\n\nFor (3,3): \\( x = (3+3)/2 = 3 \\), \\( y = (3-3)/2 = 0 \\). So, (3,0).\n\nFor (9,1): \\( x = (9+1)/2 = 5 \\), \\( y = (1-9)/2 = -4 \\). So, (5,-4).\n\nSimilarly, negative pairs would be (-1,-9), (-3,-3), (-9,-1), leading to:\n\nFor (-1,-9): \\( x = (-1 + (-9))/2 = -5 \\), \\( y = (-9 - (-1))/2 = (-8)/2 = -4 \\). So, (-5, -4).\n\nFor (-3,-3): \\( x = (-3 + (-3))/2 = -3 \\), \\( y = (-3 - (-3))/2 = 0 \\). So, (-3,0).\n\nFor (-9,-1): \\( x = (-9 + (-1))/2 = -5 \\), \\( y = (-1 - (-9))/2 = (8)/2 = 4 \\). So, (-5,4).\n\nThus, the solutions are (5,4), (5,-4), (-5,4), (-5,-4), (3,0), (-3,0). So, total of 6 solutions.\n\nBut according to my earlier approach, the number of positive divisor pairs is 3 (since 9 has divisors 1,3,9), leading to 3 positive solutions and 3 negative solutions, totaling 6. So, that matches.\n\nWait, but in this case, \\( 9 = 3^2 \\), so \\( a' \\times b' = 9 \\) if I set \\( a = a' \\), \\( b = b' \\), but in the original problem, I set \\( a = 2a' \\), \\( b = 2b' \\) because \\( ab = 2000^2 \\) is divisible by 4. So, in the case where \\( ab = 9 \\), which is not divisible by 4, I don't set \\( a = 2a' \\), but instead, I just consider all pairs where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are both odd, which in this case, they are.\n\nSo, going back, in the original problem, \\( ab = 2000^2 \\), which is divisible by 4, so \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) must both be even, leading to \\( a' \\times b' = 1000^2 \\), with \\( a' \\) and \\( b' \\) being integers.\n\nTherefore, the number of positive divisor pairs \\( (a', b') \\) is 49, leading to 49 positive solutions and 49 negative solutions, totaling 98.\n\nBut wait, in the smaller example, the number of positive divisor pairs was 3, leading to 3 positive solutions and 3 negative solutions, totaling 6, which is correct.\n\nSimilarly, in the original problem, 49 positive pairs lead to 49 positive solutions, and 49 negative pairs lead to 49 negative solutions, totaling 98.\n\nHowever, I should check if any of these solutions are duplicates. For example, if \\( (a', b') \\) and \\( (b', a') \\) lead to different points, which they do unless \\( a' = b' \\). So, in the case where \\( a' \\neq b' \\), each pair and its counterpart lead to distinct points. When \\( a' = b' \\), they lead to points \\( (2a', 0) \\) and \\( (-2a', 0) \\), which are distinct unless \\( a' = 0 \\), which isn't possible here.\n\nTherefore, the total number of lattice points is 98.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Each positive divisor pair \\( (a', b') \\) gives a unique point \\( (x, y) \\), and each negative divisor pair gives a unique point \\( (-x, -y) \\) if \\( y \\) is positive, or \\( (-x, y) \\) if \\( y \\) is negative. Wait, no, as I saw earlier, the negative pairs give \\( (-x, a' - b') \\), which is not necessarily the same as \\( (x, b' - a') \\). So, these are distinct points unless \\( a' = b' \\), in which case \\( y = 0 \\) and \\( -y = 0 \\), but \\( x \\) and \\( -x \\) are distinct unless \\( x = 0 \\), which isn't possible here.\n\nTherefore, all 98 points are distinct.\n\nWait, but let me test with another small example to be sure.\n\nTake \\( x^2 - y^2 = 16 \\). Then, \\( ab = 16 \\), and since 16 is divisible by 4, \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) must both be even. So, set \\( a = 2a' \\), \\( b = 2b' \\), leading to \\( 4a'b' = 16 \\), so \\( a'b' = 4 \\).\n\nThe positive divisors of 4 are 1, 2, 4. So, the positive divisor pairs are (1,4), (2,2), (4,1).\n\nEach of these gives:\n\n(1,4): \\( x = 1 + 4 = 5 \\), \\( y = 4 - 1 = 3 \\). So, (5,3).\n\n(2,2): \\( x = 2 + 2 = 4 \\), \\( y = 2 - 2 = 0 \\). So, (4,0).\n\n(4,1): \\( x = 4 + 1 = 5 \\), \\( y = 1 - 4 = -3 \\). So, (5,-3).\n\nNegative pairs:\n\n(-1,-4): \\( x = -1 + (-4) = -5 \\), \\( y = (-4) - (-1) = -3 \\). So, (-5,-3).\n\n(-2,-2): \\( x = -2 + (-2) = -4 \\), \\( y = (-2) - (-2) = 0 \\). So, (-4,0).\n\n(-4,-1): \\( x = -4 + (-1) = -5 \\), \\( y = (-1) - (-4) = 3 \\). So, (-5,3).\n\nThus, the solutions are (5,3), (5,-3), (-5,3), (-5,-3), (4,0), (-4,0). Total of 6 solutions.\n\nAccording to my earlier approach, the number of positive divisor pairs is 3, leading to 3 positive solutions and 3 negative solutions, totaling 6, which matches.\n\nSo, in the original problem, with 49 positive divisor pairs, leading to 49 positive solutions and 49 negative solutions, totaling 98, which should be correct.\n\nBut wait, in the example with \\( x^2 - y^2 = 9 \\), which isn't divisible by 4, we didn't have to set \\( a = 2a' \\), but instead, we considered all pairs where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are both odd, leading to 6 solutions. So, in the original problem, since \\( 2000^2 \\) is divisible by 4, we set \\( a = 2a' \\), \\( b = 2b' \\), leading to \\( a'b' = 1000^2 \\), and 49 positive divisor pairs, leading to 98 solutions.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 98 lattice points.\n\nWait, but let me think again. In the example with \\( x^2 - y^2 = 4 \\), we had 2 solutions: (2,0) and (-2,0). According to the approach, the number of positive divisor pairs is 1 (since \\( 1000^2 \\) in that case would be \\( 2^2 \\), but actually, in that case, \\( a' \\times b' = 1 \\), so only one pair, leading to two solutions when considering negative pairs. So, that works.\n\nSimilarly, in the original problem, with 49 positive divisor pairs, each leading to a positive solution and a negative solution, totaling 98.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 98 lattice points.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of lattice points on the hyperbola \\( x^2 - y^2 = 2000^2 \\), we factor the equation as \\( (x - y)(x + y) = 2000^2 \\). Let \\( a = x - y \\) and \\( b = x + y \\), so \\( ab = 2000^2 \\). Since \\( 2000^2 \\) is divisible by 4, both \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) must be even. Setting \\( a = 2a' \\) and \\( b = 2b' \\), we get \\( a'b' = 1000^2 \\).\n\nThe number of positive divisors of \\( 1000^2 \\) is 49, leading to 49 positive pairs \\( (a', b') \\). Each positive pair corresponds to a unique solution \\( (x, y) \\), and each negative pair \\( (-a', -b') \\) corresponds to another unique solution \\( (-x, -y) \\). Thus, there are \\( 49 \\times 2 = 98 \\) lattice points.\n\n**Answer:** The number of lattice points is \\boxed{98}.",
