A circle with diameter of $BC$ meets side $AC$ at $D.$ If $AD = 1$ and $BD = 4,$ then what is $CD$? Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this geometry problem here, and I need to figure out the length of CD in a right triangle setup. Let me try to visualize and break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem says that triangle ABC is a right triangle with a right angle at B. So, I imagine triangle ABC where point B is the right angle, meaning sides AB and BC are the legs, and AC is the hypotenuse.\n\nNext, there's a circle with diameter BC. Hmm, okay, so the circle has BC as its diameter, which means the center of the circle is the midpoint of BC. Since BC is the diameter, the circle should pass through points B and C. Now, the circle meets side AC at point D. So, point D is somewhere along AC, and since the circle passes through B and C, and D is another intersection point, I think D is between A and C because it's on AC.\n\nWe are given that AD = 1 and BD = 4. The question is asking for CD. So, I need to find the length from C to D on side AC.\n\nLet me try to sketch this in my mind. Triangle ABC with right angle at B. AC is the hypotenuse, and D is a point on AC such that AD is 1 unit and BD is 4 units. The circle with diameter BC intersects AC at D.\n\nI remember that when a circle has a diameter BC, any point on the circle will form a right angle with B and C. So, angle BDC should be a right angle because D lies on the circle with diameter BC. Wait, is that correct? Let me think. Yes, by Thales' theorem, any triangle inscribed in a circle where one side is the diameter will be a right triangle. So, triangle BDC is a right triangle with the right angle at D.\n\nSo, triangle BDC is right-angled at D. That means BD is perpendicular to DC. Wait, no, BD is one of the sides, but in triangle BDC, the right angle is at D, so BD and DC are the legs, and BC is the hypotenuse. Hmm, but BC is the diameter of the circle, so BC is equal to 2r, where r is the radius. But I don't know the radius yet.\n\nWait, perhaps I can use some coordinate geometry here. Let me assign coordinates to the points to make it easier. Let me place point B at the origin (0,0). Since it's a right-angled triangle at B, I can let point A be on the x-axis and point C on the y-axis. So, point A is at (a, 0), point B is at (0,0), and point C is at (0, c), where a and c are the lengths of AB and BC respectively.\n\nNow, the hypotenuse AC goes from (a,0) to (0,c), so its equation can be found. The circle with diameter BC would have its center at the midpoint of BC, which is at (0, c/2), and its radius is c/2. The equation of this circle is then x\u00b2 + (y - c/2)\u00b2 = (c/2)\u00b2, which simplifies to x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - c y = 0.\n\nNow, point D lies on AC, so let me find the parametric equation of AC. The line AC goes from (a,0) to (0,c), so any point on AC can be represented as (a - a t, 0 + c t) where t is between 0 and 1. So, point D can be written as (a(1 - t), c t) for some t.\n\nSince D lies on the circle, plugging its coordinates into the circle's equation should satisfy it. So, substituting x = a(1 - t) and y = c t into the circle's equation:\n\n[a(1 - t)]\u00b2 + (c t)\u00b2 - c (c t) = 0\nExpanding this:\na\u00b2 (1 - t)\u00b2 + c\u00b2 t\u00b2 - c\u00b2 t = 0\nExpanding (1 - t)\u00b2:\na\u00b2 (1 - 2t + t\u00b2) + c\u00b2 t\u00b2 - c\u00b2 t = 0\nMultiply through:\na\u00b2 - 2 a\u00b2 t + a\u00b2 t\u00b2 + c\u00b2 t\u00b2 - c\u00b2 t = 0\nCombine like terms:\n(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2) t\u00b2 - (2 a\u00b2 + c\u00b2) t + a\u00b2 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in terms of t. Let me write it as:\n[(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2)] t\u00b2 - [(2 a\u00b2 + c\u00b2)] t + a\u00b2 = 0\n\nLet me denote the coefficients as A = a\u00b2 + c\u00b2, B = -(2 a\u00b2 + c\u00b2), and C = a\u00b2. So, the quadratic is A t\u00b2 + B t + C = 0.\n\nUsing the quadratic formula, t = [-B \u00b1 sqrt(B\u00b2 - 4AC)] / (2A)\n\nPlugging in the values:\nt = [ (2 a\u00b2 + c\u00b2) \u00b1 sqrt( (2 a\u00b2 + c\u00b2)^2 - 4 (a\u00b2 + c\u00b2)(a\u00b2) ) ] / [2 (a\u00b2 + c\u00b2)]\n\nLet me compute the discriminant D:\nD = (2 a\u00b2 + c\u00b2)^2 - 4 (a\u00b2 + c\u00b2)(a\u00b2)\nExpanding the first term:\n(4 a^4 + 4 a\u00b2 c\u00b2 + c^4) - 4 (a^4 + a\u00b2 c\u00b2)\n= 4 a^4 + 4 a\u00b2 c\u00b2 + c^4 - 4 a^4 - 4 a\u00b2 c\u00b2\n= c^4\n\nSo, sqrt(D) = c\u00b2\n\nTherefore, t = [ (2 a\u00b2 + c\u00b2) \u00b1 c\u00b2 ] / [2 (a\u00b2 + c\u00b2)]\n\nSo, two possible solutions:\n\n1. t = [ (2 a\u00b2 + c\u00b2) + c\u00b2 ] / [2 (a\u00b2 + c\u00b2)] = (2 a\u00b2 + 2 c\u00b2) / [2 (a\u00b2 + c\u00b2)] = (2(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2)) / [2(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2)] = 1\n\n2. t = [ (2 a\u00b2 + c\u00b2) - c\u00b2 ] / [2 (a\u00b2 + c\u00b2)] = (2 a\u00b2) / [2 (a\u00b2 + c\u00b2)] = a\u00b2 / (a\u00b2 + c\u00b2)\n\nNow, t = 1 would correspond to point C, but since D is another intersection point on AC, we take t = a\u00b2 / (a\u00b2 + c\u00b2). So, point D is at (a(1 - t), c t) = (a(1 - a\u00b2/(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2)), c * a\u00b2/(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2)).\n\nSimplifying the x-coordinate:\na(1 - a\u00b2/(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2)) = a * [ (a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - a\u00b2) / (a\u00b2 + c\u00b2) ) ] = a * (c\u00b2 / (a\u00b2 + c\u00b2)) ) = (a c\u00b2) / (a\u00b2 + c\u00b2)\n\nSimilarly, the y-coordinate:\nc * (a\u00b2 / (a\u00b2 + c\u00b2)) = (a\u00b2 c) / (a\u00b2 + c\u00b2)\n\nSo, point D is at ( (a c\u00b2)/(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2), (a\u00b2 c)/(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2) )\n\nNow, we also know that AD = 1 and BD = 4. Let's use these to set up equations.\n\nFirst, let's find AD. AD is the distance from A to D. Point A is at (a, 0), and point D is at ( (a c\u00b2)/(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2), (a\u00b2 c)/(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2) )\n\nThe distance AD can be calculated using the distance formula:\n\nAD = sqrt[ (a - (a c\u00b2)/(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2))\u00b2 + (0 - (a\u00b2 c)/(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2))\u00b2 ]\n\nSimplify the terms inside the square root:\n\nFirst, the x-component:\na - (a c\u00b2)/(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2) = a ( (a\u00b2 + c\u00b2) - c\u00b2 ) / (a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 ) = a (a\u00b2) / (a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 ) = a\u00b3 / (a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 )\n\nThe y-component:\n0 - (a\u00b2 c)/(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2) = - (a\u00b2 c)/(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 )\n\nSo, AD\u00b2 = [a\u00b3 / (a\u00b2 + c\u00b2)]\u00b2 + [ - (a\u00b2 c)/(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2) ]\u00b2\n= (a^6)/(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2)^2 + (a^4 c\u00b2)/(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2)^2\n= [a^6 + a^4 c\u00b2] / (a\u00b2 + c\u00b2)^2\n= a^4 (a\u00b2 + c\u00b2) / (a\u00b2 + c\u00b2)^2\n= a^4 / (a\u00b2 + c\u00b2)\n\nSince AD = 1, then AD\u00b2 = 1, so:\n\na^4 / (a\u00b2 + c\u00b2) = 1\n=> a^4 = a\u00b2 + c\u00b2\n=> a^4 - a\u00b2 - c\u00b2 = 0\nLet me note this as equation (1): a^4 - a\u00b2 - c\u00b2 = 0\n\nNext, let's find BD. BD is the distance from B to D. Point B is at (0,0), and point D is at ( (a c\u00b2)/(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2), (a\u00b2 c)/(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2) )\n\nSo, BD = sqrt[ ( (a c\u00b2)/(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2) )\u00b2 + ( (a\u00b2 c)/(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2) )\u00b2 ]\n\nSimplify inside the square root:\n\n= [ (a\u00b2 c^4) + (a^4 c\u00b2) ] / (a\u00b2 + c\u00b2)^2\n= a\u00b2 c\u00b2 (c\u00b2 + a\u00b2) / (a\u00b2 + c\u00b2)^2\n= a\u00b2 c\u00b2 / (a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 )\n\nSince BD = 4, then BD\u00b2 = 16, so:\n\na\u00b2 c\u00b2 / (a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 ) = 16\nLet me note this as equation (2): a\u00b2 c\u00b2 = 16 (a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 )\n\nNow, from equation (1), we have a^4 - a\u00b2 - c\u00b2 = 0, which can be rearranged to c\u00b2 = a^4 - a\u00b2.\n\nLet me substitute c\u00b2 = a^4 - a\u00b2 into equation (2):\n\na\u00b2 (a^4 - a\u00b2) = 16 (a\u00b2 + (a^4 - a\u00b2))\nSimplify left side:\na^6 - a^4\n\nRight side:\n16 (a^4) because a\u00b2 + a^4 - a\u00b2 = a^4\n\nSo, equation becomes:\na^6 - a^4 = 16 a^4\nBring all terms to left side:\na^6 - a^4 - 16 a^4 = 0\na^6 - 17 a^4 = 0\nFactor out a^4:\na^4 (a\u00b2 - 17) = 0\n\nSince a is a length, a \u2260 0, so a\u00b2 - 17 = 0 => a\u00b2 = 17 => a = sqrt(17)\n\nNow, knowing a\u00b2 = 17, we can find c\u00b2 from equation (1):\nc\u00b2 = a^4 - a\u00b2 = (17)^2 - 17 = 289 - 17 = 272\nSo, c\u00b2 = 272 => c = sqrt(272) = 4 sqrt(17) because 272 = 16 * 17.\n\nNow, we can find CD. Since AC is the hypotenuse, its length is sqrt(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2) = sqrt(17 + 272) = sqrt(289) = 17.\n\nPoint D is on AC, so AC = AD + DC = 1 + DC = 17, so DC = 17 - 1 = 16.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. But let me verify using another approach to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, since triangle BDC is right-angled at D, we can use the Pythagorean theorem there.\n\nWe have BD = 4, DC = x (which we need to find), and BC is the diameter of the circle, which we found as c = 4 sqrt(17). So, BC = 4 sqrt(17).\n\nIn triangle BDC, right-angled at D:\nBD\u00b2 + DC\u00b2 = BC\u00b2\nSo, 4\u00b2 + x\u00b2 = (4 sqrt(17))\u00b2\n16 + x\u00b2 = 16 * 17\n16 + x\u00b2 = 272\nx\u00b2 = 272 - 16 = 256\nx = sqrt(256) = 16\n\nSo, CD is 16 units long. That matches the earlier result. So, I think that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check if AC is indeed 17. Since a\u00b2 = 17 and c\u00b2 = 272, then AC = sqrt(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2) = sqrt(17 + 272) = sqrt(289) = 17, which is correct. So, AC is 17, AD is 1, so CD is 16.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the answer should be 16.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe length of CD is \\boxed{16}.\n</think>\n\nGiven a right triangle \\( \\triangle ABC \\) with a right angle at \\( B \\), a circle with diameter \\( BC \\) intersects side \\( AC \\) at \\( D \\).
