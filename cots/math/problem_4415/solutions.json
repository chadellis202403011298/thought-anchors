Problem: Find all real values of $x$ that satisfy $\\frac{x(x+1)}{(x-4)^2} \\ge 12.$ (Give your answer in interval notation.) Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I need to solve the inequality \\(\\frac{x(x+1)}{(x-4)^2} \\ge 12\\). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that when dealing with rational inequalities, it's important to consider the domain restrictions and where the expression might be positive or negative. \n\nFirst, I should note that the denominator is \\((x-4)^2\\), which is always positive except when \\(x = 4\\), where it's zero. But since the denominator can't be zero, \\(x = 4\\) is excluded from the domain. So, I have to make sure that \\(x \\neq 4\\).\n\nNow, to solve the inequality \\(\\frac{x(x+1)}{(x-4)^2} \\ge 12\\), I think I should bring all terms to one side to make it easier to analyze. Let me subtract 12 from both sides:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x(x+1)}{(x-4)^2} - 12 \\ge 0\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies the inequality to:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x(x+1) - 12(x-4)^2}{(x-4)^2} \\ge 0\n\\]\n\nOkay, so now I have a single rational expression on the left side. I need to simplify the numerator to see if I can factor it or make it more manageable. Let's expand the numerator:\n\nFirst, expand \\(x(x + 1)\\):\n\n\\[\nx(x + 1) = x^2 + x\n\\]\n\nNext, expand \\(12(x - 4)^2\\):\n\nFirst, \\((x - 4)^2 = x^2 - 8x + 16\\), so multiplying by 12:\n\n\\[\n12(x^2 - 8x + 16) = 12x^2 - 96x + 192\n\\]\n\nNow, subtract this from the earlier expansion:\n\n\\[\nx^2 + x - (12x^2 - 96x + 192) = x^2 + x - 12x^2 + 96x - 192\n\\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n- \\(x^2 - 12x^2 = -11x^2\\)\n- \\(x + 96x = 97x\\)\n- \\(-192\\)\n\nSo the numerator simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n-11x^2 + 97x - 192\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the inequality becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{-11x^2 + 97x - 192}{(x - 4)^2} \\ge 0\n\\]\n\nHmm, dealing with a negative coefficient for \\(x^2\\) can be a bit tricky. Maybe I can factor out a negative sign to make it easier:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{- (11x^2 - 97x + 192)}{(x - 4)^2} \\ge 0\n\\]\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\n\\[\n- \\frac{11x^2 - 97x + 192}{(x - 4)^2} \\ge 0\n\\]\n\nIf I multiply both sides by -1, I have to remember to reverse the inequality sign. So:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{11x^2 - 97x + 192}{(x - 4)^2} \\le 0\n\\]\n\nAlright, now I have a more standard form of a rational inequality: \\(\\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} \\le 0\\), where \\(P(x) = 11x^2 - 97x + 192\\) and \\(Q(x) = (x - 4)^2\\).\n\nMy next step is to find the zeros of the numerator and denominator because these are the critical points where the expression can change sign. \n\nFirst, let's find the zeros of the numerator: \\(11x^2 - 97x + 192 = 0\\). I'll use the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{97 \\pm \\sqrt{(-97)^2 - 4 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 192}}{2 \\cdot 11}\n\\]\n\nCalculating the discriminant:\n\n\\[\nD = 97^2 - 4 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 192\n\\]\n\\[\n97^2 = 9409\n\\]\n\\[\n4 \\cdot 11 = 44; 44 \\cdot 192 = 8448\n\\]\n\\[\nD = 9409 - 8448 = 961\n\\]\n\n961 is a perfect square; its square root is 31.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{97 \\pm 31}{22}\n\\]\n\nCalculating both roots:\n\n1. \\(x = \\frac{97 + 31}{22} = \\frac{128}{22} = \\frac{64}{11} \\approx 5.818\\)\n2. \\(x = \\frac{97 - 31}{22} = \\frac{66}{22} = 3\\)\n\nSo, the numerator is zero at \\(x = 3\\) and \\(x = \\frac{64}{11}\\).\n\nNext, the denominator is zero at \\(x = 4\\), but as I noted earlier, \\(x = 4\\) is excluded from the domain.\n\nNow, I can plot these critical points on a number line to determine the intervals where the expression is negative or zero. The critical points divide the real number line into intervals:\n\n1. \\( (-\\infty, 3) \\)\n2. \\( (3, 4) \\)\n3. \\( (4, \\frac{64}{11}) \\)\n4. \\( (\\frac{64}{11}, \\infty) \\)\n\nI need to test each interval to see the sign of the expression \\(\\frac{11x^2 - 97x + 192}{(x - 4)^2}\\) in each interval.\n\nBut before that, let me note that since the denominator is \\((x - 4)^2\\), which is always positive except at \\(x = 4\\), the sign of the entire expression is determined by the numerator \\(11x^2 - 97x + 192\\).\n\nSo, the expression \\(\\frac{11x^2 - 97x + 192}{(x - 4)^2}\\) is positive when the numerator is positive and negative when the numerator is negative.\n\nGiven that the numerator is a quadratic opening upwards (since the coefficient of \\(x^2\\) is positive), it will be positive outside the roots and negative between the roots.\n\nTherefore, the numerator is positive when \\(x \\le 3\\) or \\(x \\ge \\frac{64}{11}\\), and negative when \\(3 < x < \\frac{64}{11}\\).\n\nBut remember, the denominator is always positive, so the entire expression \\(\\frac{11x^2 - 97x + 192}{(x - 4)^2}\\) will have the same sign as the numerator.\n\nSo, the expression is positive on \\( (-\\infty, 3) \\) and \\( (\\frac{64}{11}, \\infty) \\), and negative on \\( (3, \\frac{64}{11}) \\).\n\nBut our inequality is \\(\\frac{11x^2 - 97x + 192}{(x - 4)^2} \\le 0\\), which includes where the expression is negative or zero. So, the solution would be \\(x\\) in \\( [3, \\frac{64}{11}] \\).\n\nHowever, I need to consider the point \\(x = 4\\) where the denominator is zero. Since \\(x = 4\\) is excluded, it's not part of the solution.\n\nBut wait, let me check if \\(x = 3\\) and \\(x = \\frac{64}{11}\\) are included. Since the inequality is \\(\\le 0\\), and at \\(x = 3\\) and \\(x = \\frac{64}{11}\\), the expression is zero, these points are included in the solution.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the solution is \\(x\\) in \\([3, 4) \\cup (4, \\frac{64}{11}]\\).\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me double-check. The expression is \\(\\frac{11x^2 - 97x + 192}{(x - 4)^2} \\le 0\\), which is true when the numerator is negative or zero, but the denominator is always positive except at \\(x = 4\\). So, the expression is negative when \\(3 < x < \\frac{64}{11}\\), and zero at \\(x = 3\\) and \\(x = \\frac{64}{11}\\). So, the solution should include all \\(x\\) such that \\(3 \\le x \\le \\frac{64}{11}\\), but excluding \\(x = 4\\).\n\nSo, in interval notation, that's \\([3, 4) \\cup (4, \\frac{64}{11}]\\).\n\nBut let me verify this with a test point in each interval to ensure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n1. Interval \\( (-\\infty, 3) \\): Let's pick \\(x = 0\\).\n\nPlugging into the original inequality: \\(\\frac{0(0+1)}{(0-4)^2} = 0 \\ge 12\\)? No, 0 is not greater than or equal to 12. So, this interval is not part of the solution.\n\n2. Interval \\( (3, 4) \\): Let's pick \\(x = 3.5\\).\n\nCalculate numerator: \\(11*(3.5)^2 - 97*(3.5) + 192\\).\n\nFirst, \\(3.5^2 = 12.25\\), so \\(11*12.25 = 134.75\\).\n\nThen, \\(97*3.5 = 339.5\\).\n\nSo, numerator: 134.75 - 339.5 + 192 = (134.75 + 192) - 339.5 = 326.75 - 339.5 = -12.75.\n\nDenominator: \\((3.5 - 4)^2 = (-0.5)^2 = 0.25\\).\n\nSo, the expression is \\(-12.75 / 0.25 = -51\\), which is less than 0. So, this interval satisfies the inequality.\n\n3. Interval \\( (4, \\frac{64}{11}) \\): Let's pick \\(x = 5\\), since \\(\\frac{64}{11} \\approx 5.818\\).\n\nCalculate numerator: \\(11*(5)^2 - 97*(5) + 192 = 275 - 485 + 192 = (275 + 192) - 485 = 467 - 485 = -18.\n\nDenominator: \\((5 - 4)^2 = 1\\).\n\nSo, expression is \\(-18 / 1 = -18 < 0\\). So, this interval also satisfies the inequality.\n\n4. Interval \\( (\\frac{64}{11}, \\infty) \\): Let's pick \\(x = 6\\).\n\nNumerator: \\(11*36 - 97*6 + 192 = 396 - 582 + 192 = (396 + 192) - 582 = 588 - 582 = 6.\n\nDenominator: \\((6 - 4)^2 = 4.\n\nSo, expression is \\(6 / 4 = 1.5 > 0\\). So, this interval does not satisfy the inequality.\n\nSo, my earlier conclusion seems correct. The expression is negative in \\( (3, 4) \\) and \\( (4, \\frac{64}{11}) \\), and zero at \\(x = 3\\) and \\(x = \\frac{64}{11}\\).\n\nTherefore, the solution set is \\(x\\) in \\([3, 4) \\cup (4, \\frac{64}{11}]\\).\n\nBut just to make sure, let me test the endpoints.\n\nAt \\(x = 3\\):\n\nOriginal inequality: \\(\\frac{3*4}{(3-4)^2} = \\frac{12}{1} = 12 \\ge 12\\). Yes, it's equal, so included.\n\nAt \\(x = \\frac{64}{11}\\):\n\nCalculate numerator: \\(11*(64/11)^2 - 97*(64/11) + 192\\).\n\nFirst, \\((64/11)^2 = 4096/121\\), so \\(11*(4096/121) = 4096/11 \u2248 372.36.\n\nThen, \\(97*(64/11) = (97*64)/11 \u2248 6208/11 \u2248 564.36.\n\nSo, numerator: 4096/11 - 6208/11 + 192 = (4096 - 6208)/11 + 192 = (-2112)/11 + 192 = -192 + 192 = 0.\n\nSo, the expression is 0 at \\(x = 64/11\\), which is included.\n\nTherefore, the solution is indeed \\([3, 4) \\cup (4, 64/11]\\).\n\nI think that's the final answer. Let me just write it in interval notation as \\([3, 4) \\cup (4, \\frac{64}{11}]\\).\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe solution is \\boxed{\\left[3, 4\\right) \\cup \\left(4, \\dfrac{64}{11}\\right]}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the inequality \\(\\frac{x(x+1)}{(x-4)^2} \\ge 12\\), we start by bringing all terms to one side:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x(x+1)}{(x-4)^2} - 12 \\ge 0\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{x(x+1) - 12(x-4)^2}{(x-4)^2} \\ge 0\n\\]\n\nExpanding and simplifying the numerator:\n\n\\[\nx(x + 1) = x^2 + x\n\\]\n\\[\n12(x - 4)^2 = 12x^2 - 96x + 192\n\\]\n\\[\nx^2 + x - (12x^2 - 96x + 192) = -11x^2 + 97x - 192\n\\]\n\nThus, the inequality becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{-11x^2 + 97x - 192}{(x - 4)^2} \\ge 0\n\\]\n\nFactoring out a negative sign:\n\n\\[\n- \\frac{11x^2 - 97x + 192}{(x - 4)^2} \\ge 0\n\\]\n\nMultiplying both sides by -1 and reversing the inequality:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{11x^2 - 97x + 192}{(x - 4)^2} \\le 0\n\\]\n\nFinding the roots of the numerator using the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{97 \\pm 31}{22}\n\\]\n\nThis gives the roots \\(x = 3\\) and \\(x = \\frac{64}{11}\\).\n\nThe critical points are \\(x = 3\\), \\(x = 4\\), and \\(x = \\frac{64}{11}\\).
