Problem: Write the following expression as a polynomial: $$(2x^2+3x+7)(x+1)-(x+1)(x^2+4x-63)+(3x-14)(x+1)(x+5).$$ Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I need to write this expression as a polynomial. The expression is:\n\n$$(2x^2 + 3x + 7)(x + 1) - (x + 1)(x^2 + 4x - 63) + (3x - 14)(x + 1)(x + 5).$$\n\nHmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can simplify it step by step. Let me see. I notice that each term has a common factor of (x + 1). Maybe I can factor that out first to make it easier. Let me try that.\n\nSo, factoring out (x + 1), the expression becomes:\n\n$$(x + 1)[(2x^2 + 3x + 7) - (x^2 + 4x - 63) + (3x - 14)(x + 5)].$$\n\nWait, is that right? Let me check each term. The first term is (2x\u00b2 + 3x +7)(x+1), so yes, (x+1) is a factor. The second term is -(x+1)(x\u00b2 +4x -63), so that's also (x+1) multiplied by the negative of that quadratic. The third term is (3x -14)(x+1)(x+5), so that's (x+1) times (3x -14)(x+5). So, yes, I can factor out (x+1) from all three terms. So, the expression is (x + 1) times [the rest].\n\nNow, I need to simplify the expression inside the brackets. Let me write that part out:\n\n$$(2x^2 + 3x + 7) - (x^2 + 4x - 63) + (3x - 14)(x + 5).$$\n\nOkay, let's handle each part step by step. First, I'll expand (3x -14)(x +5) because that's a multiplication of two binomials, which I can do using the distributive property.\n\nSo, (3x -14)(x +5) = 3x*(x) + 3x*(5) -14*(x) -14*(5)\n= 3x\u00b2 + 15x -14x -70\n= 3x\u00b2 + (15x -14x) -70\n= 3x\u00b2 + x -70.\n\nAlright, so that part simplifies to 3x\u00b2 + x -70.\n\nNow, let's go back to the expression inside the brackets:\n\n(2x\u00b2 + 3x +7) - (x\u00b2 +4x -63) + (3x\u00b2 +x -70).\n\nLet me write that out without the brackets:\n\n2x\u00b2 + 3x +7 -x\u00b2 -4x +63 +3x\u00b2 +x -70.\n\nWait, I have to be careful with the signs. The second term is subtracted, so each term inside the parentheses is subtracted. So, it's -x\u00b2 -4x +63.\n\nNow, let's combine like terms.\n\nFirst, let's collect all the x\u00b2 terms:\n\n2x\u00b2 -x\u00b2 +3x\u00b2 = (2 -1 +3)x\u00b2 = 4x\u00b2.\n\nNext, the x terms:\n\n3x -4x +x = (3 -4 +1)x = 0x. Hmm, so the x terms cancel out.\n\nNow, the constant terms:\n\n7 +63 -70 = (7 +63) -70 = 70 -70 = 0.\n\nWait, so after combining all the terms, I get 4x\u00b2 + 0x + 0, which is just 4x\u00b2.\n\nSo, the expression inside the brackets simplifies to 4x\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, the entire original expression is:\n\n(x +1)*4x\u00b2 = 4x\u00b2(x +1).\n\nNow, let's write that as a polynomial by expanding it.\n\nMultiplying 4x\u00b2 by each term inside the parentheses:\n\n4x\u00b2 * x = 4x\u00b3,\n\n4x\u00b2 *1 = 4x\u00b2.\n\nSo, when we combine these, the expression becomes 4x\u00b3 +4x\u00b2.\n\nWait, that seems too simple. Let me double-check my steps because I might have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nStarting again, let's go through the steps:\n\n1. Factoring out (x +1):\n\n$$(x +1)[(2x\u00b2 +3x +7) - (x\u00b2 +4x -63) + (3x -14)(x +5)].$$\n\n2. Expanding (3x -14)(x +5):\n\n3x*x = 3x\u00b2,\n\n3x*5 = 15x,\n\n-14*x = -14x,\n\n-14*5 = -70,\n\nSo, 3x\u00b2 +15x -14x -70 = 3x\u00b2 +x -70. That seems correct.\n\n3. Now, substituting back into the expression inside the brackets:\n\n(2x\u00b2 +3x +7) - (x\u00b2 +4x -63) + (3x\u00b2 +x -70).\n\nExpanding the subtraction:\n\n= 2x\u00b2 +3x +7 -x\u00b2 -4x +63 +3x\u00b2 +x -70.\n\nLet me list all the terms:\n\n2x\u00b2, -x\u00b2, +3x\u00b2,\n\n3x, -4x, +x,\n\n7, +63, -70.\n\nNow, combining like terms:\n\nx\u00b2 terms: 2x\u00b2 -x\u00b2 +3x\u00b2 = (2 -1 +3)x\u00b2 = 4x\u00b2.\n\nx terms: 3x -4x +x = (3 -4 +1)x = 0x.\n\nConstant terms: 7 +63 -70 = 70 -70 = 0.\n\nSo, indeed, the expression inside the brackets simplifies to 4x\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is (x +1)*4x\u00b2 = 4x\u00b2(x +1) = 4x\u00b3 +4x\u00b2.\n\nWait, but let me check if I did the factoring correctly. When I factor out (x +1), each term inside the original expression is divided by (x +1). So, the first term is (2x\u00b2 +3x +7), the second is -(x\u00b2 +4x -63), and the third is (3x -14)(x +5). So, when I factor out (x +1), the remaining parts are correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that when I factor out (x +1), I correctly subtracted the second term and added the third term. So, the expression is:\n\n(x +1)[(2x\u00b2 +3x +7) - (x\u00b2 +4x -63) + (3x -14)(x +5)].\n\nYes, that's correct because the original expression is A - B + C, where A, B, and C are each multiplied by (x +1). So, factoring out (x +1), we get (x +1)(A' - B' + C'), where A' is (2x\u00b2 +3x +7), B' is (x\u00b2 +4x -63), and C' is (3x -14)(x +5). That's correct.\n\nSo, the expansion inside the brackets seems correct, leading to 4x\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is (x +1)*4x\u00b2 = 4x\u00b3 +4x\u00b2.\n\nWait, but I feel like maybe I missed something because the problem seems too straightforward. Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should expand each term separately and then combine them without factoring out (x +1) first. Maybe that would be a better approach to confirm.\n\nLet me try that method as a cross-check.\n\nFirst, expand each product separately.\n\n1. Expand (2x\u00b2 +3x +7)(x +1):\n\nUsing distributive property:\n\n= 2x\u00b2*(x) + 2x\u00b2*(1) +3x*(x) +3x*(1) +7*(x) +7*(1)\n= 2x\u00b3 +2x\u00b2 +3x\u00b2 +3x +7x +7\nCombine like terms:\n\n2x\u00b3 + (2x\u00b2 +3x\u00b2) + (3x +7x) +7\n= 2x\u00b3 +5x\u00b2 +10x +7.\n\n2. Expand -(x +1)(x\u00b2 +4x -63):\n\nFirst, expand (x +1)(x\u00b2 +4x -63):\n\n= x*(x\u00b2) +x*(4x) +x*(-63) +1*(x\u00b2) +1*(4x) +1*(-63)\n= x\u00b3 +4x\u00b2 -63x +x\u00b2 +4x -63\nCombine like terms:\n\nx\u00b3 + (4x\u00b2 +x\u00b2) + (-63x +4x) -63\n= x\u00b3 +5x\u00b2 -59x -63.\n\nNow, apply the negative sign:\n\n= -x\u00b3 -5x\u00b2 +59x +63.\n\n3. Expand (3x -14)(x +1)(x +5):\n\nFirst, let's compute (3x -14)(x +1):\n\n= 3x*(x) +3x*(1) -14*(x) -14*(1)\n= 3x\u00b2 +3x -14x -14\n= 3x\u00b2 -11x -14.\n\nNow, multiply this by (x +5):\n\n= (3x\u00b2 -11x -14)*(x) + (3x\u00b2 -11x -14)*(5)\n= 3x\u00b3 -11x\u00b2 -14x +15x\u00b2 -55x -70.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n3x\u00b3 + (-11x\u00b2 +15x\u00b2) + (-14x -55x) -70\n= 3x\u00b3 +4x\u00b2 -69x -70.\n\nNow, let's add up all three expanded terms:\n\nFirst term: 2x\u00b3 +5x\u00b2 +10x +7.\n\nSecond term: -x\u00b3 -5x\u00b2 +59x +63.\n\nThird term: 3x\u00b3 +4x\u00b2 -69x -70.\n\nNow, adding them together:\n\nLet me write each term:\n\n2x\u00b3 -x\u00b3 +3x\u00b3 = (2 -1 +3)x\u00b3 = 4x\u00b3.\n\n5x\u00b2 -5x\u00b2 +4x\u00b2 = (5 -5 +4)x\u00b2 = 4x\u00b2.\n\n10x +59x -69x = (10 +59 -69)x = 0x.\n\n7 +63 -70 = (7 +63) -70 = 70 -70 = 0.\n\nSo, combining all terms, we get 4x\u00b3 +4x\u00b2 +0x +0 = 4x\u00b3 +4x\u00b2.\n\nWhich matches what I got earlier when I factored out (x +1). So, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the polynomial is 4x\u00b3 +4x\u00b2.\n\nWait, but let me check again because sometimes when factoring, I might have missed a term or miscalculated.\n\nWait, in the first method, I factored out (x +1) and ended up with 4x\u00b2, leading to 4x\u00b3 +4x\u00b2. In the second method, expanding each term separately, I also got 4x\u00b3 +4x\u00b2. So, both methods agree, which gives me more confidence.\n\nTherefore, the expression simplifies to the polynomial 4x\u00b3 +4x\u00b2.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. It's always good to check using two different methods to ensure accuracy. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations now.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe polynomial is \\boxed{4x^3 + 4x^2}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the given expression as a polynomial, we start by factoring out the common term \\((x + 1)\\):\n\n$$(2x^2 + 3x + 7)(x + 1) - (x + 1)(x^2 + 4x - 63) + (3x - 14)(x + 1)(x + 5).$$\n\nFactoring out \\((x + 1)\\), we get:\n\n$$(x + 1)\\left[(2x^2 + 3x + 7) - (x^2 + 4x - 63) + (3x - 14)(x + 5)\\right].$$\n\nNext, we simplify the expression inside the brackets. First, we expand \\((3x - 14)(x + 5)\\):\n\n$$(3x - 14)(x + 5) = 3x^2 + 15x - 14x - 70 = 3x^2 + x - 70.$$\n\nSubstituting this back into the expression inside the brackets, we get:\n\n$$(2x^2 + 3x + 7) - (x^2 + 4x - 63) + (3x^2 + x - 70).$$\n\nExpanding and combining like terms:\n\n- \\(2x^2 - x^2 + 3x^2 = 4x^2\\)\n- \\(3x - 4x + x = 0x\\)\n- \\(7 + 63 - 70 = 0\\)\n\nThus, the expression inside the brackets simplifies to \\(4x^2\\).\n\nTherefore, the entire expression becomes:\n\n$$(x + 1) \\cdot 4x^2 = 4x^2(x + 1) = 4x^3 + 4x^2.$$\n\nThe polynomial is:\n\n\\boxed{4x^3 + 4x^2}",
