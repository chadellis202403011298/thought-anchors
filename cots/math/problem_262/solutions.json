What is $AB + A$? Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this algebra problem here. The expression is 12y\u00b2 - 65y + 42, and I'm supposed to write it as (Ay - 14)(By - 3), where A and B are integers. Then, I need to find AB + A. Hmm, okay, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when factoring a quadratic expression like 12y\u00b2 - 65y + 42, the goal is to break it down into two binomials. In this case, the binomials are given in the form (Ay - 14)(By - 3). So, I need to find integers A and B such that when I multiply these two binomials, I get the original quadratic expression.\n\nLet me write out the multiplication to see what I'm dealing with. If I multiply (Ay - 14) by (By - 3), I should use the distributive property, which is also known as the FOIL method for binomials. FOIL stands for First, Outer, Inner, Last, which refers to the terms you multiply together.\n\nSo, let's do that:\n\n(Ay - 14)(By - 3) = Ay * By + Ay * (-3) + (-14) * By + (-14) * (-3)\n\nSimplifying each term:\n\nFirst: Ay * By = ABy\u00b2\nOuter: Ay * (-3) = -3Ay\nInner: (-14) * By = -14By\nLast: (-14) * (-3) = +42\n\nNow, combining all these terms together:\n\nABy\u00b2 - 3Ay - 14By + 42\n\nNow, let's group the like terms:\n\nABy\u00b2 + (-3A - 14B)y + 42\n\nSo, this should be equal to the original expression, which is 12y\u00b2 - 65y + 42.\n\nTherefore, we can set up equations by equating the coefficients of corresponding terms.\n\nFirst, the coefficient of y\u00b2:\n\nA * B = 12\n\nNext, the coefficient of y:\n\n-3A - 14B = -65\n\nAnd the constant term:\n\n42 = 42, which is already matching, so that doesn't give us any new information.\n\nSo, now we have two equations:\n\n1. A * B = 12\n2. -3A -14B = -65\n\nOur goal is to find integers A and B that satisfy both equations.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. Since A and B are integers and their product is 12, I can list the possible pairs of integers (A, B) such that A * B = 12.\n\nThe factors of 12 can be both positive and negative. Let me list all possible pairs:\n\n(1, 12), (2, 6), (3, 4), (4, 3), (6, 2), (12, 1), (-1, -12), (-2, -6), (-3, -4), (-4, -3), (-6, -2), (-12, -1)\n\nNow, for each of these pairs, I can plug into the second equation: -3A -14B = -65, and see which pair satisfies it.\n\nLet me start testing each pair one by one.\n\nFirst pair: (1, 12)\n\nSo, A=1, B=12\n\nPlugging into the second equation:\n\n-3(1) -14(12) = -3 -168 = -171\n\nBut we need this to be -65. So, -171 \u2260 -65. Not a match.\n\nNext pair: (2, 6)\n\nA=2, B=6\n\n-3(2) -14(6) = -6 -84 = -90\n\nStill not -65. So, move on.\n\nNext pair: (3, 4)\n\nA=3, B=4\n\n-3(3) -14(4) = -9 -56 = -65\n\nOh! That's exactly what we need. So, A=3, B=4.\n\nWait, let me double-check:\n\n-3*3 = -9\n\n-14*4 = -56\n\n-9 + (-56) = -65. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, we found that A=3 and B=4.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me check the other positive pairs as well, to make sure there aren't other solutions.\n\nNext pair: (4,3)\n\nA=4, B=3\n\n-3(4) -14(3) = -12 -42 = -54\n\nNot equal to -65.\n\nNext pair: (6,2)\n\nA=6, B=2\n\n-3(6) -14(2) = -18 -28 = -46\n\nNope.\n\nNext pair: (12,1)\n\nA=12, B=1\n\n-3(12) -14(1) = -36 -14 = -50\n\nStill not -65.\n\nNow, let's check the negative pairs.\n\nFirst negative pair: (-1, -12)\n\nA=-1, B=-12\n\n-3*(-1) -14*(-12) = 3 + 168 = 171\n\nWhich is positive 171, not -65. So, no.\n\nNext pair: (-2, -6)\n\nA=-2, B=-6\n\n-3*(-2) -14*(-6) = 6 + 84 = 90\n\nNot -65.\n\nNext pair: (-3, -4)\n\nA=-3, B=-4\n\n-3*(-3) -14*(-4) = 9 + 56 = 65\n\nHmm, 65 is positive, but we need -65. So, if I have 65, that's not equal to -65. So, that's not a solution.\n\nWait, but if I have A=-3, B=-4, then the product A*B would be (-3)*(-4)=12, which is correct. But the second equation gives us 65 instead of -65. So, that's not a solution.\n\nNext pair: (-4, -3)\n\nA=-4, B=-3\n\n-3*(-4) -14*(-3) = 12 + 42 = 54\n\nNope, not -65.\n\nNext pair: (-6, -2)\n\nA=-6, B=-2\n\n-3*(-6) -14*(-2) = 18 + 28 = 46\n\nNope.\n\nNext pair: (-12, -1)\n\nA=-12, B=-1\n\n-3*(-12) -14*(-1) = 36 +14=50\n\nNot -65.\n\nSo, among all the possible integer pairs, only (3,4) satisfies both equations: A*B=12 and -3A -14B=-65.\n\nTherefore, A=3 and B=4.\n\nNow, the problem asks for AB + A.\n\nSo, first compute AB: 3*4=12\n\nThen, add A: 12 + 3=15\n\nSo, AB + A=15.\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake, let me go through the steps again.\n\nWe have (3y -14)(4y -3). Let's multiply this out to see if it gives 12y\u00b2 -65y +42.\n\nFirst: 3y * 4y = 12y\u00b2\n\nOuter: 3y * (-3) = -9y\n\nInner: (-14) *4y= -56y\n\nLast: (-14)*(-3)=42\n\nSo, adding up all terms:\n\n12y\u00b2 -9y -56y +42=12y\u00b2 -65y +42.\n\nYes, that's exactly the original expression. So, the values of A=3 and B=4 are correct.\n\nTherefore, AB + A = 3*4 +3=12+3=15.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of \\( AB + A \\) is \\boxed{15}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem of expressing \\(12y^2 - 65y + 42\\) as \\((Ay - 14)(By - 3)\\) where \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are integers, we start by expanding the given form and equating the coefficients.\n\nExpanding \\((Ay - 14)(By - 3)\\) using the distributive property (FOIL method):\n\n\\[\n(Ay - 14)(By - 3) = ABy^2 - 3Ay - 14By + 42\n\\]\n\nGrouping the like terms, we get:\n\n\\[\nABy^2 + (-3A - 14B)y + 42\n\\]\n\nThis must equal the original expression \\(12y^2 - 65y + 42\\). Therefore, we equate the coefficients:\n\n1. The coefficient of \\(y^2\\): \\(AB = 12\\)\n2. The coefficient of \\(y\\): \\(-3A - 14B = -65\\)\n\nWe need to find integers \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) that satisfy these equations. Listing the factor pairs of 12, we test each pair in the second equation:\n\n- For the pair \\((3, 4)\\):\n  - \\(AB = 3 \\times 4 = 12\\)\n  - \\(-3(3) - 14(4) = -9 - 56 = -65\\)\n\nThis pair satisfies both equations. Thus, \\(A = 3\\) and \\(B = 4\\).\n\nFinally, we calculate \\(AB + A\\):\n\n\\[\nAB + A = 3 \\times 4 + 3 = 12 + 3 = 15\n\\]\n\nThe value of \\(AB + A\\) is \\(\\boxed{15}\\).",
