Problem: Find the arithmetic mean of the prime numbers in this list:      21, 23, 25, 27, 29 Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the arithmetic mean of the prime numbers in the list: 21, 23, 25, 27, 29. Hmm, arithmetic mean is just the average, right? So I have to add up all the prime numbers in the list and then divide by how many there are.\n\nFirst, I should figure out which numbers in the list are prime. Let me go through each number one by one.\n\nStarting with 21. I remember that 21 is divisible by 3 and 7 because 3 times 7 is 21. So, 21 is not a prime number. Okay, moving on to the next number.\n\n23. Hmm, is 23 a prime number? Let me think. I know that prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves. So, does 23 have any divisors other than 1 and 23? Let me check. 23 divided by 2 is 11.5, which isn't an integer. 23 divided by 3 is about 7.666, not an integer. 5? No, 23 divided by 5 is 4.6. Next, 7? 23 divided by 7 is about 3.285. So, since none of these divisions result in whole numbers, 23 is a prime number. So, 23 is prime.\n\nNext number is 25. Is 25 prime? Well, 25 is 5 squared, so 5 times 5 is 25. That means it has divisors other than 1 and itself, so 25 is not prime. Okay, moving on.\n\n27. Is 27 prime? I think 27 is divisible by 3 because 3 times 9 is 27. So, yes, 27 is not a prime number. So, 27 is out.\n\nLast number is 29. Is 29 prime? Let me check. Divided by 2, it's 14.5, not an integer. Divided by 3 is about 9.666, not an integer. Divided by 5 is 5.8, not an integer. 7? 29 divided by 7 is about 4.142, not an integer. 11? 29 divided by 11 is about 2.636, not an integer. So, since none of these divisions result in whole numbers, 29 is a prime number.\n\nSo, from the list, the prime numbers are 23 and 29. Now, I need to find the arithmetic mean of these two numbers.\n\nFirst, I'll add them together: 23 + 29. Let's see, 23 plus 20 is 43, and then plus 9 is 52. So, 23 + 29 equals 52.\n\nNow, there are two prime numbers, so I'll divide the sum by 2. 52 divided by 2 is 26. So, the arithmetic mean is 26.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss any primes in the list. The list was 21, 23, 25, 27, 29. I identified 23 and 29 as primes. 21 is 3\u00d77, 25 is 5\u00d75, 27 is 3\u00d79. Yep, so only 23 and 29 are primes. So, adding them gives 52, and dividing by 2 gives 26. That seems right.\n\nI think I've got it. The arithmetic mean is 26.\n</think>\n\nThe arithmetic mean of the prime numbers in the list is calculated by first identifying the primes (23 and 29), summing them to get 52, and then dividing by the count of primes (2), resulting in 26.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Prime Numbers:**\n   - From the list [21, 23, 25, 27, 29], determine which numbers are prime.\n   - 21 is not prime (divisible by 3 and 7).\n   - 23 is prime (no divisors other than 1 and 23).\n   - 25 is not prime (5\u00d75).\n   - 27 is not prime (3\u00d79).\n   - 29 is prime (no divisors other than 1 and 29).\n   - **Primes Identified:** 23, 29.\n\n2. **Calculate the Sum of Primes:**\n   - Add the prime numbers: 23 + 29 = 52.\n\n3. **Determine the Number of Primes:**\n   - There are 2 prime numbers.\n\n4. **Compute the Arithmetic Mean:**\n   - Divide the sum by the number of primes: 52 \u00f7 2 = 26.\n\n**Answer:** The arithmetic mean is \\boxed{26}.",
