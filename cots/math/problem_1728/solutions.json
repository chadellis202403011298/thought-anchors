Problem: What is the coefficient of $x^2$ when $-5x^3 - 5x^2 - 7x + 1$ is multiplied by $-x^2 - 6x + 1$ and the like terms are combined? Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the coefficient of \\( x^2 \\) when multiplying the two polynomials \\( -5x^3 - 5x^2 - 7x + 1 \\) and \\( -x^2 - 6x + 1 \\). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that to multiply two polynomials, I need to use the distributive property, which means multiplying each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial and then combining like terms. But since the problem is only asking for the coefficient of \\( x^2 \\), maybe I don't need to compute all the terms. I can just focus on the parts that will result in an \\( x^2 \\) term after multiplication. That should save some time.\n\nLet me write down the two polynomials again:\n\nFirst polynomial: \\( -5x^3 - 5x^2 - 7x + 1 \\)\n\nSecond polynomial: \\( -x^2 - 6x + 1 \\)\n\nI need to find all the pairs of terms (one from each polynomial) that when multiplied together, give an \\( x^2 \\) term. So, I should look for pairs where the exponents add up to 2 because \\( x^a \\times x^b = x^{a+b} \\). So, \\( a + b = 2 \\).\n\nLet me list the terms from the first polynomial with their exponents:\n\n1. \\( -5x^3 \\) (exponent 3)\n2. \\( -5x^2 \\) (exponent 2)\n3. \\( -7x \\) (exponent 1)\n4. \\( 1 \\) (exponent 0)\n\nAnd from the second polynomial:\n\n1. \\( -x^2 \\) (exponent 2)\n2. \\( -6x \\) (exponent 1)\n3. \\( 1 \\) (exponent 0)\n\nNow, I need to find all pairs where the exponents add up to 2.\n\nLet me consider each term in the first polynomial and see which terms in the second polynomial can pair with it to give an exponent of 2.\n\nStarting with the first term in the first polynomial: \\( -5x^3 \\) (exponent 3). To get a total exponent of 2 when multiplied by a term from the second polynomial, the term from the second polynomial must have an exponent of \\( 2 - 3 = -1 \\). But exponents can't be negative, so there's no such term in the second polynomial. So, this term won't contribute to the \\( x^2 \\) term.\n\nNext term in the first polynomial: \\( -5x^2 \\) (exponent 2). So, we need a term from the second polynomial with exponent \\( 2 - 2 = 0 \\). The only term with exponent 0 is the constant term, which is 1. So, multiplying \\( -5x^2 \\) by 1 will give \\( -5x^2 \\). That's one contribution.\n\nMoving on to the third term in the first polynomial: \\( -7x \\) (exponent 1). We need a term from the second polynomial with exponent \\( 2 - 1 = 1 \\). The term with exponent 1 in the second polynomial is \\( -6x \\). So, multiplying \\( -7x \\) by \\( -6x \\) will give \\( (-7) \\times (-6) x^{1+1} = 42x^2 \\). That's another contribution.\n\nFourth term in the first polynomial: \\( 1 \\) (exponent 0). We need a term from the second polynomial with exponent \\( 2 - 0 = 2 \\). The term with exponent 2 in the second polynomial is \\( -x^2 \\). So, multiplying 1 by \\( -x^2 \\) gives \\( -1x^2 \\). That's the third contribution.\n\nNow, I should check if there are any other terms that might contribute to the \\( x^2 \\) term. Wait, let me make sure I didn't miss any combinations.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Instead of going term by term from the first polynomial, maybe I should consider all possible pairs where the exponents add up to 2. Let me list all possible pairs:\n\n1. From the first polynomial, exponent 0 (term 1) and second polynomial, exponent 2 (term \\( -x^2 \\)): 1 * (-x^2) = -x^2\n2. From the first polynomial, exponent 1 (term \\( -7x \\)) and second polynomial, exponent 1 (term \\( -6x \\)): (-7x) * (-6x) = 42x^2\n3. From the first polynomial, exponent 2 (term \\( -5x^2 \\)) and second polynomial, exponent 0 (term 1): (-5x^2) * 1 = -5x^2\n\nWait, but earlier I thought of it as term 1 in the first polynomial being \\( -5x^3 \\), term 2 being \\( -5x^2 \\), etc. So, perhaps I should index them properly.\n\nWait, maybe I should just list all possible pairs where the exponents add up to 2, regardless of which polynomial they come from.\n\nLet me think: the exponents in the first polynomial are 3, 2, 1, 0.\n\nThe exponents in the second polynomial are 2, 1, 0.\n\nSo, possible pairs where a + b = 2:\n\n- a=0, b=2: first poly term 4 (1) and second poly term 1 (-x^2)\n- a=1, b=1: first poly term 3 (-7x) and second poly term 2 (-6x)\n- a=2, b=0: first poly term 2 (-5x^2) and second poly term 3 (1)\n\nIs that all? Let me check:\n\na=3: b would need to be -1, which doesn't exist.\n\na=2: b=0, which we have.\n\na=1: b=1, which we have.\n\na=0: b=2, which we have.\n\nSo, those are the only three pairs that contribute to the x^2 term.\n\nSo, now, let's compute each of these products:\n\n1. \\( 1 \\times (-x^2) = -x^2 \\)\n2. \\( (-7x) \\times (-6x) = 42x^2 \\)\n3. \\( (-5x^2) \\times 1 = -5x^2 \\)\n\nNow, adding these up: (-1)x^2 + 42x^2 + (-5)x^2.\n\nLet me compute the coefficients:\n\n-1 + 42 = 41\n\n41 + (-5) = 36\n\nSo, the coefficient of \\( x^2 \\) is 36.\n\nWait, that seems correct, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake in signs or multiplication.\n\nFirst, \\( 1 \\times (-x^2) = -x^2 \\) \u2192 coefficient is -1.\n\nSecond, \\( (-7x) \\times (-6x) = 42x^2 \\) \u2192 coefficient is +42.\n\nThird, \\( (-5x^2) \\times 1 = -5x^2 \\) \u2192 coefficient is -5.\n\nAdding them: -1 + 42 = 41; 41 - 5 = 36.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should perform the full multiplication just to confirm, but that would take longer. Alternatively, perhaps I can check my work another way.\n\nWait, let me try a different approach. Maybe I can compute all the terms that would contribute to x^2 and see if I get the same result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute each possible product and sum their coefficients.\n\nWait, but I think my initial approach was correct. So, the coefficient is 36.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't miss any terms. Let me list all possible pairs again:\n\nFrom first poly:\n\nTerm 1: -5x^3 (exponent 3). To get x^2, we'd need a term with exponent -1, which doesn't exist. So, no contribution.\n\nTerm 2: -5x^2 (exponent 2). Needs a term with exponent 0: 1. So, -5x^2 * 1 = -5x^2.\n\nTerm 3: -7x (exponent 1). Needs a term with exponent 1: -6x. So, (-7x)*(-6x) = 42x^2.\n\nTerm 4: 1 (exponent 0). Needs a term with exponent 2: -x^2. So, 1*(-x^2) = -x^2.\n\nSo, those are the only terms that contribute to x^2.\n\nAdding their coefficients: -5 + 42 -1 = 36.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check: is there any other term that could contribute? For example, is there a term in the first polynomial with exponent a and a term in the second with exponent b such that a + b = 2, other than the ones I considered?\n\nWait, let me list all possible a and b:\n\na can be 3, 2, 1, 0.\n\nb can be 2, 1, 0.\n\nSo, possible (a, b) pairs where a + b = 2:\n\n- a=0, b=2 \u2192 yes, that's term 4 and term 1.\n- a=1, b=1 \u2192 term 3 and term 2.\n- a=2, b=0 \u2192 term 2 and term 3.\n\na=3, b=-1 \u2192 no term.\n\nSo, only these three pairs. So, I think I accounted for all possible contributions.\n\nTherefore, the coefficient is 36.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure I didn't make any arithmetic mistakes.\n\nCalculating each product's coefficient:\n\n1. Term 4 (1) * term 1 (-x^2): 1 * (-1) = -1\n2. Term 3 (-7x) * term 2 (-6x): (-7) * (-6) = 42\n3. Term 2 (-5x^2) * term 3 (1): (-5) * 1 = -5\n\nAdding these: (-1) + 42 + (-5) = (-1 -5) + 42 = (-6) + 42 = 36.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nI think that's the right answer. So, the coefficient of \\( x^2 \\) is 36.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe coefficient of \\( x^2 \\) is \\boxed{36}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coefficient of \\( x^2 \\) when multiplying the polynomials \\( -5x^3 - 5x^2 - 7x + 1 \\) and \\( -x^2 - 6x + 1 \\), we need to identify the pairs of terms from each polynomial whose exponents add up to 2.\n\n1. The term \\( 1 \\) (exponent 0) from the first polynomial multiplies the term \\( -x^2 \\) (exponent 2) from the second polynomial:\n   \\[\n   1 \\times (-x^2) = -x^2\n   \\]\n   Coefficient: \\(-1\\)\n\n2. The term \\( -7x \\) (exponent 1) from the first polynomial multiplies the term \\( -6x \\) (exponent 1) from the second polynomial:\n   \\[\n   (-7x) \\times (-6x) = 42x^2\n   \\]\n   Coefficient: \\(42\\)\n\n3. The term \\( -5x^2 \\) (exponent 2) from the first polynomial multiplies the term \\( 1 \\) (exponent 0) from the second polynomial:\n   \\[\n   (-5x^2) \\times 1 = -5x^2\n   \\]\n   Coefficient: \\(-5\\)\n\nAdding these coefficients together:\n\\[\n-1 + 42 - 5 = 36\n\\]\n\nThus, the coefficient of \\( x^2 \\) is \\(\\boxed{36}\\).",
