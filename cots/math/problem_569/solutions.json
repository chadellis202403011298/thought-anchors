Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I need to evaluate the expression \\(a^2 \\cdot a^5\\) when \\(a = 3\\). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on exponents, but I remember some rules from algebra.\n\nFirst, I know that when you multiply two expressions with the same base, you can add their exponents. So, \\(a^m \\cdot a^n = a^{m+n}\\). Let me confirm that. Yeah, that sounds right because when you multiply, you're essentially adding the exponents. For example, \\(a^2\\) is \\(a \\cdot a\\), and \\(a^5\\) is \\(a \\cdot a \\cdot a \\cdot a \\cdot a\\), so when you multiply them together, you have \\(a\\) multiplied by itself 2 + 5 times, which is 7 times. So, that would be \\(a^7\\).\n\nWait, but the problem asks me to evaluate it when \\(a = 3\\). So, after simplifying the expression, I can substitute 3 into it. Let me write that down.\n\nSo, starting with the original expression:\n\\[a^2 \\cdot a^5\\]\n\nApplying the exponent rule:\n\\[a^{2+5} = a^7\\]\n\nNow, substituting \\(a = 3\\):\n\\[3^7\\]\n\nOkay, now I need to compute \\(3^7\\). Let me calculate that step by step because 3 to the 7th power might be a bit large, and I don't want to make a mistake.\n\nStarting with \\(3^1 = 3\\).\n\nThen, \\(3^2 = 3 \\cdot 3 = 9\\).\n\nNext, \\(3^3 = 3^2 \\cdot 3 = 9 \\cdot 3 = 27\\).\n\nContinuing, \\(3^4 = 3^3 \\cdot 3 = 27 \\cdot 3 = 81\\).\n\nThen, \\(3^5 = 3^4 \\cdot 3 = 81 \\cdot 3 = 243\\).\n\nNext, \\(3^6 = 3^5 \\cdot 3 = 243 \\cdot 3 = 729\\).\n\nFinally, \\(3^7 = 3^6 \\cdot 3 = 729 \\cdot 3 = 2187\\).\n\nWait, let me check that multiplication again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 729 times 3. Let me break it down:\n\n700 * 3 = 2100,\n20 * 3 = 60,\n9 * 3 = 27.\n\nAdding those together: 2100 + 60 = 2160, plus 27 is 2187. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could compute \\(3^7\\) directly by knowing that \\(3^5 = 243\\), and then \\(3^7 = 3^5 \\cdot 3^2 = 243 \\cdot 9\\). Let me try that method as a cross-check.\n\n243 * 9: Let's compute that.\n\n243 * 9:\n3 * 9 = 27, write down 7 and carry over 2.\n4 * 9 = 36, plus 2 is 38, write down 8 and carry over 3.\n2 * 9 = 18, plus 3 is 21, write down 21.\n\nSo, 243 * 9 = 2187. Yep, same result. So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could compute \\(3^7\\) using exponentiation by squaring or other methods, but I think the step-by-step multiplication is sufficient here and confirms that 3^7 is indeed 2187.\n\nLet me just recap to make sure I didn't miss any steps. The problem was to evaluate \\(a^2 \\cdot a^5\\) when \\(a = 3\\). I used the exponent rule to combine the exponents, resulting in \\(a^7\\), then substituted 3 for \\(a\\), leading to \\(3^7\\). Calculating \\(3^7\\) step by step gave me 2187, which I verified using another method to ensure accuracy.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here, but just to be thorough, let me check each step again.\n\n1. Exponent rule: \\(a^m \\cdot a^n = a^{m+n}\\). Correct. So, \\(a^2 \\cdot a^5 = a^{7}\\). That seems right.\n\n2. Substituting \\(a = 3\\): So, \\(3^7\\). Yep, that's correct.\n\n3. Calculating \\(3^7\\):\n\n- \\(3^1 = 3\\)\n- \\(3^2 = 9\\)\n- \\(3^3 = 27\\)\n- \\(3^4 = 81\\)\n- \\(3^5 = 243\\)\n- \\(3^6 = 729\\)\n- \\(3^7 = 2187\\)\n\nEach step is correct, so I'm confident that the final result is 2187.\n\nAlternatively, I could compute \\(3^7\\) as \\(3 \\times 3 \\times 3 \\times 3 \\times 3 \\times 3 \\times 3\\), but that would be tedious. The step-by-step exponentiation and the cross-check using the alternative multiplication method both gave me the same answer, so I'm pretty sure it's correct.\n\nI guess another way to think about it is using logarithms or exponent properties, but that might complicate things unnecessarily. The straightforward approach seems sufficient here.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the expression \\(a^2 \\cdot a^5\\) when \\(a = 3\\) simplifies to \\(3^7\\), which equals 2187.\n</think>\n\nTo evaluate the expression \\(a^2 \\cdot a^5\\) when \\(a = 3\\):\n\n1. **Combine the exponents**: Using the rule \\(a^m \\cdot a^n = a^{m+n}\\), we get \\(a^{2+5} = a^7\\).\n2. **Substitute \\(a = 3\\)**: This gives \\(3^7\\).\n3. **Calculate \\(3^7\\)**:\n   - \\(3^1 = 3\\)\n   - \\(3^2 = 9\\)\n   - \\(3^3 = 27\\)\n   - \\(3^4 = 81\\)\n   - \\(3^5 = 243\\)\n   - \\(3^6 = 729\\)\n   - \\(3^7 = 2187\\)\n\n**Answer**: \\(\\boxed{2187}\\)",
