Problem: Two of the roots of the equation \\[ax^3+bx^2+cx+d=0\\]are $3$ and $-2.$ Given that $a \\neq 0,$ compute $\\frac{b+c}{a}.$ Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this problem here: a cubic equation, ax\u00b3 + bx\u00b2 + cx + d = 0, and two of its roots are 3 and -2. I'm supposed to find (b + c)/a. Hmm, okay, let's see.\n\nFirst, I remember that for polynomials, especially cubic ones, if you know some roots, you can factor the polynomial. Since it's a cubic, there should be three roots in total, right? So, we have two roots given: 3 and -2. Let's call the third root something, maybe k, just to represent it.\n\nSo, the equation can be written as a(x - 3)(x + 2)(x - k) = 0. Wait, but actually, since the leading coefficient is a, we can factor it out like that. So, expanding this should give me back the original equation, and then I can compare coefficients to find b, c, and d in terms of a and k. Then, I can compute (b + c)/a.\n\nBut before I jump into expanding, maybe there's a smarter way. I recall Vieta's formulas, which relate the coefficients of a polynomial to sums and products of its roots. For a cubic equation ax\u00b3 + bx\u00b2 + cx + d = 0, the sum of the roots is -b/a, the sum of the products of the roots two at a time is c/a, and the product of the roots is -d/a.\n\nSo, let me denote the roots as r1 = 3, r2 = -2, and r3 = k. Then, according to Vieta's:\n\n1. r1 + r2 + r3 = -b/a\n2. r1r2 + r1r3 + r2r3 = c/a\n3. r1r2r3 = -d/a\n\nI need to find (b + c)/a. Hmm, so maybe if I can express b and c in terms of the roots, and then add them together, I can get something useful.\n\nLet me write down the expressions from Vieta's:\n\nFrom 1: 3 + (-2) + k = -b/a \u21d2 (1 + k) = -b/a \u21d2 b = -a(1 + k)\n\nFrom 2: (3)(-2) + (3)(k) + (-2)(k) = c/a \u21d2 (-6 + 3k - 2k) = c/a \u21d2 (-6 + k) = c/a \u21d2 c = a(-6 + k)\n\nSo, now, b = -a(1 + k) and c = a(-6 + k). Therefore, b + c = -a(1 + k) + a(-6 + k) = a[-(1 + k) + (-6 + k)].\n\nLet me compute the expression inside the brackets: -(1 + k) + (-6 + k) = -1 - k -6 + k = (-1 -6) + (-k + k) = -7 + 0 = -7.\n\nSo, b + c = a*(-7) \u21d2 (b + c)/a = -7.\n\nWait, that was straightforward! So, regardless of the value of k, the third root, the expression (b + c)/a is always -7.\n\nLet me just verify that I didn't make any mistakes in the signs. From Vieta's, the sum of roots is -b/a, so 3 - 2 + k = -b/a \u21d2 1 + k = -b/a \u21d2 b = -a(1 + k). That seems right.\n\nFor the sum of products two at a time: 3*(-2) + 3*k + (-2)*k = -6 + 3k - 2k = -6 + k. So, c/a = -6 + k \u21d2 c = a(-6 + k). That looks correct.\n\nAdding b and c: b + c = -a(1 + k) + a(-6 + k) = a[-(1 + k) -6 + k] = a[-1 -k -6 + k] = a[-7]. So, yes, (b + c)/a = -7.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any errors in the calculations. So, the answer should be -7.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of \\(\\frac{b + c}{a}\\) is \\boxed{-7}.\n</think>\n\nGiven the cubic equation \\(ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0\\) with roots 3, -2, and \\(k\\), we use Vieta's formulas to find \\(\\frac{b + c}{a}\\).\n\n1. The sum of the roots is given by:\n   \\[\n   3 + (-2) + k = -\\frac{b}{a}\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we get:\n   \\[\n   1 + k = -\\frac{b}{a} \\implies b = -a(1 + k)\n   \\]\n\n2. The sum of the products of the roots taken two at a time is given by:\n   \\[\n   3(-2) + 3k + (-2)k = \\frac{c}{a}\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we get:\n   \\[\n   -6 + k = \\frac{c}{a} \\implies c = a(-6 + k)\n   \\]\n\n3. Adding \\(b\\) and \\(c\\):\n   \\[\n   b + c = -a(1 + k) + a(-6 + k)\n   \\]\n   Simplifying inside the brackets:\n   \\[\n   -(1 + k) + (-6 + k) = -1 - k - 6 + k = -7\n   \\]\n   Therefore:\n   \\[\n   b + c = a(-7)\n   \\]\n   Dividing by \\(a\\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{b + c}{a} = -7\n   \\]\n\nThe value of \\(\\frac{b + c}{a}\\) is \\(\\boxed{-7}\\).",
