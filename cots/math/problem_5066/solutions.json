Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 5616 and 11609. Hmm, I remember that the GCD is the largest number that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder. There are a few methods to find the GCD, like listing out all the factors, but that might take too long, especially with such big numbers. I think the most efficient way is to use the Euclidean algorithm. Let me try to recall how that works.\n\nThe Euclidean algorithm involves dividing the larger number by the smaller one and then replacing the larger number with the smaller number and the smaller number with the remainder from the division. I repeat this process until the remainder is zero, and the last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\nSo, let me write down the two numbers: 11609 and 5616. Since 11609 is larger, I'll divide that by 5616.\n\nFirst step: Divide 11609 by 5616.\n\nI need to find how many times 5616 fits into 11609. Let me calculate 5616 multiplied by 2, which is 11232. Hmm, 11232 is less than 11609. Let me subtract that from 11609 to find the remainder.\n\n11609 - 11232 = 377.\n\nSo, the remainder is 377. Now, I replace the numbers with 5616 and 377. So, now I need to find the GCD of 5616 and 377.\n\nSecond step: Divide 5616 by 377.\n\nLet me see how many times 377 goes into 5616. I can try multiplying 377 by 10, which is 3770. That's less than 5616. Let me see how much more I can add. 377 times 15 is 5655, which is actually more than 5616. So, maybe 14 times.\n\n377 * 14 = 5278. Let me check: 377 * 10 = 3770, plus 377*4=1508, so 3770 + 1508 = 5278. Yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, subtract 5278 from 5616 to get the remainder.\n\n5616 - 5278 = 338.\n\nSo, the remainder is 338. Now, I replace the numbers with 377 and 338. Now, I need to find the GCD of 377 and 338.\n\nThird step: Divide 377 by 338.\n\n338 goes into 377 once because 338*1=338. The remainder is 377 - 338 = 39.\n\nSo now, I replace the numbers with 338 and 39. Now, find the GCD of 338 and 39.\n\nFourth step: Divide 338 by 39.\n\nLet me see how many times 39 goes into 338. 39*8=312, which is less than 338. 39*9=351, which is too much. So, 8 times.\n\nSubtract 312 from 338: 338 - 312 = 26.\n\nSo, the remainder is 26. Now, replace the numbers with 39 and 26. Now, find the GCD of 39 and 26.\n\nFifth step: Divide 39 by 26.\n\n26 goes into 39 once, giving 26. The remainder is 39 - 26 = 13.\n\nSo, now, replace the numbers with 26 and 13. Now, find the GCD of 26 and 13.\n\nSixth step: Divide 26 by 13.\n\n13 goes into 26 exactly 2 times with no remainder. So, the remainder is 0.\n\nSince we've reached a remainder of 0, the last non-zero remainder is 13. Therefore, the GCD of 5616 and 11609 is 13.\n\nWait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a calculation mistake. I'll go through each division again quickly.\n\n1. 11609 \u00f7 5616: 5616*2=11232, remainder 377. Correct.\n2. 5616 \u00f7 377: 377*14=5278, remainder 338. Correct.\n3. 377 \u00f7 338: remainder 39. Correct.\n4. 338 \u00f7 39: 39*8=312, remainder 26. Correct.\n5. 39 \u00f7 26: remainder 13. Correct.\n6. 26 \u00f7 13: remainder 0. Correct.\n\nYes, all steps check out. So, the GCD is indeed 13.\n</think>\n\nThe greatest common divisor of 5616 and 11609 is found using the Euclidean algorithm, which systematically reduces the problem by dividing larger numbers by smaller ones and taking remainders until a remainder of zero is reached. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Divide 11609 by 5616:**\n   - 5616 * 2 = 11232\n   - Remainder = 11609 - 11232 = 377\n\n2. **Divide 5616 by 377:**\n   - 377 * 14 = 5278\n   - Remainder = 5616 - 5278 = 338\n\n3. **Divide 377 by 338:**\n   - 338 * 1 = 338\n   - Remainder = 377 - 338 = 39\n\n4. **Divide 338 by 39:**\n   - 39 * 8 = 312\n   - Remainder = 338 - 312 = 26\n\n5. **Divide 39 by 26:**\n   - 26 * 1 = 26\n   - Remainder = 39 - 26 = 13\n\n6. **Divide 26 by 13:**\n   - 13 * 2 = 26\n   - Remainder = 26 - 26 = 0\n\nSince the remainder is now 0, the last non-zero remainder is 13.\n\n**Answer:** The greatest common divisor of 5616 and 11609 is \\boxed{13}.",
