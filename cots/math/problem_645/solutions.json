Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the fraction that equals 0.\\overline{4}, which is 0.4444... repeating forever. Hmm, I remember from school that repeating decimals can often be converted into fractions by using algebra. Let me try to recall how that works.\n\nFirst, I think I should let x equal the repeating decimal. So, let me write that down:\n\nx = 0.4444...\n\nNow, since the 4 is repeating every digit after the decimal, maybe I can multiply both sides by 10 to move the decimal point one place to the right. That way, the repeating part will still align when I subtract.\n\nSo, multiplying both sides by 10:\n\n10x = 4.4444...\n\nNow, I have two equations:\n\n1) x = 0.4444...\n2) 10x = 4.4444...\n\nIf I subtract equation 1 from equation 2, the repeating decimals should cancel out. Let's try that:\n\n10x - x = 4.4444... - 0.4444...\n\nOn the left side, 10x - x is 9x. On the right side, subtracting 0.4444... from 4.4444... leaves just 4, because the decimals cancel each other.\n\nSo, 9x = 4.\n\nNow, to solve for x, I divide both sides by 9:\n\nx = 4/9.\n\nWait, let me check that. If I take 4 divided by 9, does that give me 0.4444...?\n\nYes, because 4 divided by 9 is 0.4444..., so that seems correct.\n\nSo, the fraction equivalent of 0.\\overline{4} is 4/9.\n\nI think that's it. Let me just go through the steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n1. Let x = 0.4444...\n2. Multiply both sides by 10: 10x = 4.4444...\n3. Subtract the original equation from this new one: 10x - x = 4.4444... - 0.4444...\n4. That gives 9x = 4.\n5. Divide both sides by 9: x = 4/9.\n\nYep, that all checks out. So, 0.\\overline{4} is equal to 4/9.\n\nI guess another way to think about it is that 0.\\overline{4} is a geometric series where each term is 4*(1/10)^n, starting from n=1. So, the sum would be 4*(1/10 + 1/100 + 1/1000 + ...). The sum of an infinite geometric series with first term a and common ratio r (where |r| < 1) is a/(1 - r). Here, a is 4/10 and r is 1/10. So, the sum is (4/10)/(1 - 1/10) = (4/10)/(9/10) = (4/10)*(10/9) = 4/9. That also gives the same result, so that's another confirmation.\n\nSo, both methods lead me to the same fraction, 4/9. I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\n\nThe fraction equal to \\(0.\\overline{4}\\) is found by setting \\(x = 0.\\overline{4}\\), multiplying both sides by 10, and subtracting the original equation to eliminate the repeating decimal. Solving the resulting equation gives \\(x = \\frac{4}{9}\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{\\dfrac{4}{9}}\\)",
