What is the minimum number of buses needed to transport 411 students? Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the minimum number of buses required to transport 411 students when each bus can hold a maximum of 38 students. Hmm, let's start by understanding the problem. I have a total number of students, which is 411, and each bus can carry up to 38 students. I need to find out how many buses I need at least to transport all these students without leaving anyone behind.\n\nI think the first step is to divide the total number of students by the capacity of each bus. So, that would be 411 divided by 38. Let me write that down: 411 \u00f7 38. Now, I should do this division to see how many buses I need.\n\nLet me calculate 38 times 10, which is 380. Subtracting that from 411 gives me 31. So, 411 - 380 = 31. That means 10 buses can carry 380 students, and there are still 31 students left. So, I need an additional bus for those remaining 31 students. That would make it 11 buses in total.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing something. If I try 38 times 11, that's 418, which is more than 411. So, actually, 11 buses would have the capacity to carry 418 students, which is more than enough. But since we can't have a fraction of a bus, even if the remaining students after 10 buses are only 31, we still need a full bus for them. So, 11 buses is the minimum number needed.\n\nLet me double-check my division to ensure I didn't make a mistake. 38 goes into 411 how many times? Let's see, 38 times 10 is 380, as I thought. Then, 38 times 11 is 418, which is too much. So, 10 buses can take 380 students, leaving 31, which requires one more bus. Therefore, 11 buses are needed.\n\nI think that's it. So, the minimum number of buses required is 11.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the minimum number of buses needed to transport 411 students when each bus can hold up to 38 students, we perform the following calculation:\n\n1. **Divide the total number of students by the bus capacity:**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{411}{38} \\approx 10.8158\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Interpret the result:** Since you can't have a fraction of a bus, you round up to the next whole number. \n\n3. **Calculate the number of buses needed:**\n   \\[\n   \\lceil 10.8158 \\rceil = 11\n   \\]\n\n**Answer:** The minimum number of buses needed is \\boxed{11}.",
