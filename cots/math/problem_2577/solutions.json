The circles are mutually externally tangent, and I need to find the sum of their areas. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when two circles are externally tangent, the distance between their centers is equal to the sum of their radii. So, if I can find the radii of each circle, I can then calculate their areas and sum them up.\n\nThe triangle is a 3-4-5 right triangle, so the sides opposite the vertices A, B, and C must be 3, 4, and 5 units long, respectively. Let me confirm that: in a right triangle, the sides satisfy a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2, where c is the hypotenuse. So, 3\u00b2 + 4\u00b2 = 9 + 16 = 25, which is 5\u00b2. Yep, that checks out.\n\nNow, let's denote the radii of the circles centered at A, B, and C as r_A, r_B, and r_C, respectively. Since the circles are mutually externally tangent, the distances between each pair of centers should equal the sum of their radii.\n\nSo, the distance between A and B is 5 units. Therefore, r_A + r_B = 5.\n\nSimilarly, the distance between B and C is 4 units, so r_B + r_C = 4.\n\nAnd the distance between A and C is 3 units, so r_A + r_C = 3.\n\nWait a second, that seems a bit confusing. Let me make sure I'm assigning the sides correctly. The triangle is a 3-4-5 triangle, so the sides opposite the vertices should correspond to the sides opposite the angles. Let me visualize the Asy diagram: point A is at the top, B is at the bottom left, and C is at the bottom right. So, the side opposite A is BC, which is 5 units, the side opposite B is AC, which is 4 units, and the side opposite C is AB, which is 3 units. Hmm, so maybe my initial assignments were wrong.\n\nLet me try again. The distance between B and C is 5 units because that's the hypotenuse. The distance between A and C is 4 units, and the distance between A and B is 3 units. So, that makes more sense because in the Asy code, it draws the triangle with points at (0,0), (5,0), and (1.8,2.4). Let me calculate the distances between these points to confirm.\n\nDistance from B(0,0) to C(5,0): sqrt((5-0)^2 + (0-0)^2) = 5 units, correct.\n\nDistance from A(1.8,2.4) to B(0,0): sqrt((1.8-0)^2 + (2.4-0)^2) = sqrt(3.24 + 5.76) = sqrt(9) = 3 units, correct.\n\nDistance from A(1.8,2.4) to C(5,0): sqrt((5 - 1.8)^2 + (0 - 2.4)^2) = sqrt((3.2)^2 + (-2.4)^2) = sqrt(10.24 + 5.76) = sqrt(16) = 4 units, correct. Okay, so that's settled.\n\nSo, the sides between the centers are 3, 4, and 5 units. Now, since the circles are externally tangent, the distance between centers is the sum of their radii. Therefore:\n\nr_A + r_B = 3 (since A and B are 3 units apart)\nr_A + r_C = 4 (since A and C are 4 units apart)\nr_B + r_C = 5 (since B and C are 5 units apart)\n\nNow, I have a system of three equations:\n\n1. r_A + r_B = 3\n2. r_A + r_C = 4\n3. r_B + r_C = 5\n\nI need to solve for r_A, r_B, and r_C.\n\nLet me write them down:\n\nEquation 1: r_A + r_B = 3\n\nEquation 2: r_A + r_C = 4\n\nEquation 3: r_B + r_C = 5\n\nI can solve this system using substitution or elimination. Let me try elimination.\n\nFirst, subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2:\n\n(r_A + r_C) - (r_A + r_B) = 4 - 3\n\nSimplify:\n\nr_C - r_B = 1\n\nSo, Equation 4: r_C = r_B + 1\n\nNow, substitute Equation 4 into Equation 3:\n\nr_B + (r_B + 1) = 5\n\nSimplify:\n\n2r_B + 1 = 5\n\nSubtract 1 from both sides:\n\n2r_B = 4\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\nr_B = 2\n\nNow, substitute r_B = 2 into Equation 1:\n\nr_A + 2 = 3\n\nSubtract 2:\n\nr_A = 1\n\nNow, substitute r_B = 2 into Equation 4:\n\nr_C = 2 + 1 = 3\n\nSo, the radii are r_A = 1, r_B = 2, and r_C = 3.\n\nLet me double-check these values with all three equations:\n\n1. 1 + 2 = 3 \u2714\ufe0f\n2. 1 + 3 = 4 \u2714\ufe0f\n3. 2 + 3 = 5 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, all equations are satisfied.\n\nNow, I need to find the areas of each circle and sum them up. The area of a circle is \u03c0r\u00b2, so:\n\nArea of circle A: \u03c0*(1)^2 = \u03c0*1 = \u03c0\n\nArea of circle B: \u03c0*(2)^2 = \u03c0*4 = 4\u03c0\n\nArea of circle C: \u03c0*(3)^2 = \u03c0*9 = 9\u03c0\n\nSum of the areas: \u03c0 + 4\u03c0 + 9\u03c0 = (1 + 4 + 9)\u03c0 = 14\u03c0\n\nWait, hold on. That seems straightforward, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem didn't specify whether the circles are tangent to each other or also tangent to some other figure, but from the Asy code, it seems like they're just mutually externally tangent circles with centers forming a 3-4-5 triangle. So, I think my approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is using the concept of curvatures. In some problems involving mutually tangent circles, we can use Descartes' Circle Theorem, but I think that applies more when all circles are tangent to each other and possibly a line or another circle. In this case, since we have three circles mutually tangent, and we know the distances between centers, the method I used earlier should suffice.\n\nBut just to explore, Descartes' Circle Theorem states that for four mutually tangent circles, their curvatures satisfy a certain equation. However, in this case, we have three circles, so maybe it's not necessary. Let me check if applying Descartes' Theorem would help here or not.\n\nWait, Descartes' Theorem for three circles would require knowing the curvature of a fourth circle that's tangent to all three, which isn't the case here. So, perhaps it's not applicable. My initial method of setting up the equations based on the distances being equal to the sum of radii is more straightforward and gives a clear solution.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n- Identified the triangle sides as 3, 4, 5.\n- Set up equations based on the sum of radii equal to the distances between centers.\n- Solved the system of equations to find radii 1, 2, 3.\n- Calculated the areas as \u03c0, 4\u03c0, 9\u03c0.\n- Summed them up to get 14\u03c0.\n\nI think that's solid. Just to be thorough, let me visualize the circles:\n\n- Circle B is at (0,0) with radius 2.\n- Circle C is at (5,0) with radius 3.\n- Circle A is at (1.8,2.4) with radius 1.\n\nLet me check if the distances between centers equal the sum of radii:\n\nDistance from B to C: 5 units. Sum of radii: 2 + 3 = 5. Correct.\n\nDistance from A to B: 3 units. Sum of radii: 1 + 2 = 3. Correct.\n\nDistance from A to C: 4 units. Sum of radii: 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.\n\nEverything checks out. So, the areas are \u03c0, 4\u03c0, 9\u03c0, totaling 14\u03c0.\n\nI think I'm confident with this solution. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning or calculations.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we first recognize that the vertices of the 3-4-5 right triangle are the centers of three mutually externally tangent circles. The distances between the centers of the circles correspond to the sides of the triangle and are equal to the sum of the radii of the respective circles.\n\nWe set up the following system of equations based on the distances between the centers:\n\n1. \\( r_A + r_B = 3 \\)\n2. \\( r_A + r_C = 4 \\)\n3. \\( r_B + r_C = 5 \\)\n\nSolving this system, we find the radii of the circles:\n\n- \\( r_A = 1 \\)\n- \\( r_B = 2 \\)\n- \\( r_C = 3 \\)\n\nNext, we calculate the areas of each circle:\n\n- Area of circle A: \\( \\pi (1)^2 = \\pi \\)\n- Area of circle B: \\( \\pi (2)^2 = 4\\pi \\)\n- Area of circle C: \\( \\pi (3)^2 = 9\\pi \\)\n\nSumming these areas gives:\n\n\\[ \\pi + 4\\pi + 9\\pi = 14\\pi \\]\n\n**Answer:** The sum of the areas of the circles is \\(\\boxed{14\\pi}\\).",
