First, a MegaBall is picked from among 27 numbered balls.  Second, five WinnerBalls are picked from among 44 numbered balls. To win the lottery, you must pick the MegaBall number correctly and also pick the numbers on the five WinnerBalls (but you don't need to get the order right for the WinnerBalls).  What is the probability that the ticket I hold has the winning numbers? Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the probability of winning this lottery. Let me try to break it down step by step because I'm not too familiar with probability calculations, but I'll do my best.\n\nFirst, I remember that probability is generally the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, I think I need to find out how many possible ways there are to pick the MegaBall and the WinnerBalls, and then since I'm only interested in the one specific winning combination, the probability would be 1 divided by that total number of possible combinations.\n\nThe problem says there are two drawings. The first is picking a MegaBall from 27 numbered balls. So, I guess that means there are 27 possible outcomes for the MegaBall. Then, the second drawing is picking five WinnerBalls from 44 numbered balls. Since the order doesn't matter for the WinnerBalls, this sounds like a combination problem, not a permutation. I remember that combinations are used when the order doesn't matter, unlike permutations where it does.\n\nSo, for the MegaBall, the number of possible outcomes is straightforward: 27. But for the WinnerBalls, since we're choosing 5 out of 44 without considering order, I need to calculate the number of combinations. The formula for combinations is n choose k, which is n! divided by (k! times (n - k)!), where \"n!\" stands for the factorial of n.\n\nLet me write that down for the WinnerBalls: 44 choose 5. So, that would be 44! divided by (5! times (44 - 5)!), which simplifies to 44! / (5! * 39!). I think that's correct because 44 - 5 is 39, so the denominator becomes 5 factorial times 39 factorial.\n\nNow, since the two events (picking the MegaBall and picking the WinnerBalls) are independent, I believe the total number of possible outcomes is the product of the number of outcomes for each event. So, the total number of possible tickets would be 27 multiplied by the number of combinations for the WinnerBalls, which is 44 choose 5.\n\nTherefore, the total number of possible winning combinations is 27 * (44 choose 5). Once I calculate that, the probability of winning would be 1 divided by that total number because there's only one winning combination.\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So, the MegaBall is 27 possible choices, and the WinnerBalls are combinations of 5 from 44, which is a much larger number. So, the total number of possible tickets is 27 multiplied by the number of ways to choose 5 balls from 44.\n\nI should probably calculate the exact value of 44 choose 5 to get a sense of how big this number is. Let me try to compute that.\n\nCalculating 44 choose 5:\n\n44! / (5! * 39!) = (44 \u00d7 43 \u00d7 42 \u00d7 41 \u00d7 40) / (5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1)\n\nLet me compute the numerator first: 44 \u00d7 43 \u00d7 42 \u00d7 41 \u00d7 40.\n\nHmm, let's do this step by step.\n\n44 \u00d7 43 = 1892\n\n1892 \u00d7 42 = Let's see, 1892 \u00d7 40 = 75,680 and 1892 \u00d7 2 = 3,784, so adding them together gives 75,680 + 3,784 = 79,464.\n\n79,464 \u00d7 41 = Hmm, that's a bit bigger. Let me break it down:\n\n79,464 \u00d7 40 = 3,178,560\n\n79,464 \u00d7 1 = 79,464\n\nAdding them together: 3,178,560 + 79,464 = 3,258,024\n\n3,258,024 \u00d7 40 = Wait, no, that was after 41. Wait, no, I think I made a mistake here because 44 \u00d7 43 \u00d7 42 \u00d7 41 \u00d7 40 is 44\u00d743\u00d742\u00d741\u00d740, which is 44\u00d743=1892, then 1892\u00d742=79,464, then 79,464\u00d741=3,258,024, and then 3,258,024\u00d740=130,320,960.\n\nWait, no, that can't be right because 44\u00d743\u00d742\u00d741\u00d740 is 44\u00d743=1892, then 1892\u00d742=79,464, then 79,464\u00d741=3,258,024, then 3,258,024\u00d740=130,320,960. So the numerator is 130,320,960.\n\nNow, the denominator is 5! which is 5\u00d74\u00d73\u00d72\u00d71=120.\n\nSo, 44 choose 5 is 130,320,960 divided by 120.\n\nLet me compute that: 130,320,960 \u00f7 120.\n\nDividing by 10 first: 130,320,960 \u00f7 10 = 13,032,096\n\nThen dividing by 12: 13,032,096 \u00f7 12.\n\n12 \u00d7 1,086,008 = 13,032,096 because 12 \u00d7 1,000,000 = 12,000,000, and 12 \u00d7 86,008 = 1,032,096, so adding together gives 13,032,096.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high, but maybe that's correct. Let me check with a calculator method.\n\nAlternatively, 130,320,960 \u00f7 120: Let's divide numerator and denominator by 10 to get 13,032,096 \u00f7 12.\n\n13,032,096 \u00f7 12:\n\n12 \u00d7 1,086,008 = 13,032,096, as above.\n\nSo, 44 choose 5 is 1,086,008.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high, but I think that's correct. Let me double-check with another approach.\n\nAlternatively, 44C5 is known to be 1,086,008, so I think that's correct.\n\nSo, the number of possible combinations for the WinnerBalls is 1,086,008.\n\nNow, the total number of possible lottery tickets is 27 (MegaBall choices) multiplied by 1,086,008 (WinnerBalls combinations).\n\nSo, 27 \u00d7 1,086,008.\n\nLet me compute that.\n\nFirst, 1,086,008 \u00d7 20 = 21,720,160\n\nThen, 1,086,008 \u00d7 7 = Let's see:\n\n1,086,008 \u00d7 7:\n\n7 \u00d7 1,000,000 = 7,000,000\n\n7 \u00d7 86,008 = 602,056\n\nAdding together: 7,000,000 + 602,056 = 7,602,056\n\nNow, add 21,720,160 + 7,602,056 = 29,322,216\n\nSo, the total number of possible tickets is 29,322,216.\n\nTherefore, the probability of winning is 1 divided by 29,322,216.\n\nWait, that seems really low, but considering the number of possible combinations, it makes sense.\n\nLet me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, 44 choose 5: 44\u00d743\u00d742\u00d741\u00d740 / 5\u00d74\u00d73\u00d72\u00d71 = (44\u00d743\u00d742\u00d741\u00d740) / 120.\n\nI calculated the numerator as 130,320,960, and then divided by 120 to get 1,086,008. That seems correct.\n\nThen, 27 \u00d7 1,086,008: 27 \u00d7 1,000,000 = 27,000,000; 27 \u00d7 86,008 = Let's compute 27 \u00d7 80,000 = 2,160,000; 27 \u00d7 6,008 = 27 \u00d7 6,000 = 162,000; 27 \u00d7 8 = 216. So, 162,000 + 216 = 162,216. Then, 2,160,000 + 162,216 = 2,322,216. Then, 27,000,000 + 2,322,216 = 29,322,216. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the total number of possible tickets is 29,322,216. Therefore, the probability of holding the winning ticket is 1 / 29,322,216.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem says you have to pick the MegaBall correctly and also pick the five WinnerBalls correctly, but the order of the WinnerBalls doesn't matter. So, yes, the MegaBall is a single pick from 27, and the WinnerBalls are a combination of 5 from 44, so the total number of possible tickets is indeed 27 multiplied by 44 choose 5, which is 27 \u00d7 1,086,008 = 29,322,216.\n\nSo, the probability is 1 / 29,322,216.\n\nI think that's correct. It's a very low probability, which makes sense for a lottery.\n</think>\n\nThe probability of winning the lottery is calculated by determining the total number of possible winning combinations and then taking the reciprocal of that number. \n\n1. **MegaBall Drawing**: There are 27 possible outcomes since one ball is drawn from 27.\n\n2. **WinnerBalls Drawing**: The number of ways to choose 5 balls from 44 without order is given by the combination formula:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{44}{5} = \\frac{44!}{5!(44-5)!} = 1,086,008\n   \\]\n\n3. **Total Combinations**: Multiply the number of MegaBall outcomes by the number of WinnerBalls combinations:\n   \\[\n   27 \\times 1,086,008 = 29,322,216\n   \\]\n\n4. **Probability**: The probability of winning is 1 divided by the total number of combinations:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{29,322,216}\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer**: The probability of holding the winning ticket is \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{29322216}}.",
