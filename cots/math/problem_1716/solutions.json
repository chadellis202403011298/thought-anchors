Problem: Let \\[f(x) = \\left\\{\n\\begin{array}{cl} x^2-4 & \\text{ if }x < 7, \\\\\nx-13 & \\text{ if } x \\geq 7.\n\\end{array}\n\\right.\\] What is $f(f(f(17)))$? Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I need to find f(f(f(17))) where f(x) is defined as a piecewise function. Let me first make sure I understand the problem correctly. The function f(x) has two parts: if x is less than 7, then f(x) is x squared minus 4, and if x is greater than or equal to 7, then f(x) is x minus 13. So, f(x) changes its formula depending on the value of x. \n\nAlright, let's start by finding the innermost function first, which is f(17). Since 17 is greater than 7, I should use the second part of the piecewise function, which is x minus 13. So, f(17) = 17 - 13. Let me calculate that: 17 minus 13 is 4. So, f(17) is 4.\n\nNow, I need to find f(f(17)), which is f(4). Since 4 is less than 7, I should use the first part of the piecewise function, which is x squared minus 4. So, f(4) = 4^2 - 4. Let me compute that: 4 squared is 16, and 16 minus 4 is 12. Therefore, f(4) is 12.\n\nNext, I need to find f(f(f(17))), which is f(12). Now, 12 is greater than 7, so I should use the second part again, which is x minus 13. So, f(12) = 12 - 13. Calculating that gives me -1. Therefore, f(12) is -1.\n\nWait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with f(17), since 17 is indeed greater than 7, subtracting 13 gives 4. Then, f(4), since 4 is less than 7, squaring it gives 16, minus 4 is 12. Then, f(12), since 12 is greater than 7, subtracting 13 gives -1. Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nBut let me go through each step again just to be thorough. First, f(17): 17 is greater than 7, so f(x) = x - 13. 17 - 13 is 4. Correct.\n\nNext, f(4): 4 is less than 7, so f(x) = x^2 - 4. 4 squared is 16, 16 - 4 is 12. Correct.\n\nThen, f(12): 12 is greater than or equal to 7, so f(x) = x - 13. 12 - 13 is -1. Correct.\n\nSo, putting it all together: f(17) is 4, f(f(17)) is f(4) which is 12, and then f(f(f(17))) is f(12) which is -1. Therefore, the final answer should be -1.\n\nWait a second, just to make sure, maybe I should check if I applied the piecewise function correctly each time. Let me list the steps again:\n\n1. Compute f(17):\n   - Since 17 \u2265 7, use f(x) = x - 13.\n   - 17 - 13 = 4.\n   \n2. Compute f(4):\n   - Since 4 < 7, use f(x) = x\u00b2 - 4.\n   - 4\u00b2 = 16, 16 - 4 = 12.\n   \n3. Compute f(12):\n   - Since 12 \u2265 7, use f(x) = x - 13.\n   - 12 - 13 = -1.\n\nYes, each step checks out. So, f(f(f(17))) is indeed -1.\n</think>\n\nTo solve \\( f(f(f(17))) \\) for the given piecewise function, we evaluate each function step by step:\n\n1. **Compute \\( f(17) \\):**\n   - Since \\( 17 \\geq 7 \\), use \\( f(x) = x - 13 \\).\n   - \\( f(17) = 17 - 13 = 4 \\).\n\n2. **Compute \\( f(f(17)) = f(4) \\):**\n   - Since \\( 4 < 7 \\), use \\( f(x) = x^2 - 4 \\).\n   - \\( f(4) = 4^2 - 4 = 16 - 4 = 12 \\).\n\n3. **Compute \\( f(f(f(17))) = f(12) \\):**\n   - Since \\( 12 \\geq 7 \\), use \\( f(x) = x - 13 \\).\n   - \\( f(12) = 12 - 13 = -1 \\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is \\(\\boxed{-1}\\).",
