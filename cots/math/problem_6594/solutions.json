Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how many integers fall between \u221a5 and \u221a50 on a number line. Hmm, let's start by understanding what the problem is asking for. It wants the count of integer numbers that lie strictly between these two square roots. So, first, I should probably find the approximate values of \u221a5 and \u221a50 to see where they lie on the number line.\n\nI know that \u221a4 is 2 and \u221a9 is 3, so \u221a5 must be somewhere between 2 and 3. Let me calculate it more precisely. 2.2 squared is 4.84, and 2.3 squared is 5.29. Since 5 is between 4.84 and 5.29, \u221a5 is between 2.2 and 2.3. Maybe I can get a better approximation. Let's see, 2.23 squared is 4.9729, which is still less than 5. 2.24 squared is 5.0176, which is just a bit more than 5. So \u221a5 is approximately 2.236, right?\n\nNow, moving on to \u221a50. I remember that \u221a49 is 7, so \u221a50 must be a little more than 7. Let me calculate it. 7.1 squared is 50.41, which is just above 50, so \u221a50 is between 7 and 7.1. Specifically, since 7.07 squared is 49.9849, which is very close to 50, so \u221a50 is approximately 7.07.\n\nSo now I have \u221a5 \u2248 2.236 and \u221a50 \u2248 7.07. The problem is asking for the integers that fall strictly between these two numbers. So, the integers greater than 2.236 and less than 7.07.\n\nLet me list the integers that are between these two values. Starting from the next integer after 2.236, which is 3. Then 4, 5, 6, and finally 7. Wait, but hold on, \u221a50 is approximately 7.07, so the integer 7 is less than 7.07? Wait, no, 7 is less than 7.07, but the problem says \"between\" \u221a5 and \u221a50. So, does \"between\" include the endpoints or not? Hmm, the problem says \"fall between,\" which usually means strictly between, not including the endpoints. So, if \u221a50 is approximately 7.07, then 7 is less than 7.07, but since 7 is an integer, and 7.07 is greater than 7, does 7 fall between \u221a5 and \u221a50? Wait, actually, 7 is less than \u221a50 because \u221a50 is about 7.07, so 7 is indeed less than that. So, does 7 count as being between \u221a5 and \u221a50? Let me think.\n\nWait, if we're talking about numbers strictly between \u221a5 and \u221a50, then the integers must be greater than \u221a5 and less than \u221a50. So, \u221a5 is about 2.236, so the next integer is 3. Then, \u221a50 is about 7.07, so the integers less than 7.07 are 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. Wait, but 7 is less than 7.07, so 7 is included. But wait, does \"between\" include the upper bound? Hmm, sometimes \"between\" can be ambiguous, but in math problems, usually, it means strictly between, so not including the endpoints. So, in that case, we need integers greater than \u221a5 and less than \u221a50. So, \u221a5 is about 2.236, so the integers greater than that are 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, etc., but less than 7.07. So, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7? Wait, but 7 is less than 7.07, so 7 is included. So, the integers are 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. That's five integers. Wait, but let me make sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach it by considering the floor and ceiling functions. The smallest integer greater than \u221a5 is 3, because \u221a5 is approximately 2.236, so the next integer is 3. The largest integer less than \u221a50 is 7, because \u221a50 is approximately 7.07, so the integer part is 7. So, the integers between \u221a5 and \u221a50 are 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. That's five integers. So, the count is 5.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Sometimes when counting integers between two numbers, you can subtract the lower bound from the upper bound and take the floor minus the ceiling plus one. Wait, let me recall the formula. The number of integers between a and b, where a < b, is floor(b) - ceil(a) + 1 if the endpoints are not integers. In this case, \u221a5 and \u221a50 are not integers, so ceil(\u221a5) is 3, floor(\u221a50) is 7. So, the number of integers is 7 - 3 + 1 = 5. So that confirms it.\n\nWait, but hold on, let me make sure. If I have numbers from a to b, the number of integers is floor(b) - ceil(a) + 1. So, in this case, floor(\u221a50) is 7, ceil(\u221a5) is 3. So, 7 - 3 + 1 = 5. So, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can list them out: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. That's five numbers. So, the answer should be 5.\n\nWait, but I want to make sure I didn't include 2 or 8. Since \u221a5 is about 2.236, 2 is less than that, so it's not included. 8 is greater than 7.07, so it's not included either. So, only 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 are included. So, five integers.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is, the integers greater than \u221a5 are 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, etc., but less than \u221a50, which is 7.07, so up to 7. So, from 3 to 7 inclusive, that's 5 numbers.\n\nWait, another approach: the number of integers between two numbers is the difference between their integer parts, adjusted for whether the endpoints are included. Since \u221a5 is approximately 2.236, the next integer is 3. \u221a50 is approximately 7.07, so the integer part is 7. So, the integers between them are 3,4,5,6,7. So, that's 5 integers.\n\nI think I'm confident that the answer is 5. So, the number of integers that fall between \u221a5 and \u221a50 is 5.\n</think>\n\nThe problem requires determining how many integers lie strictly between \u221a5 and \u221a50 on a number line. \n\n1.
