Problem: What is the smallest positive integer that can be written in the form $2002m + 44444n$, where $m$ and $n$ are integers? Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the smallest positive integer that can be written in the form 2002m + 44444n, where m and n are integers. Hmm, I think this has something to do with linear combinations of integers. Maybe it's related to the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 2002 and 44444? Because I remember that the smallest positive integer that can be expressed as a linear combination of two numbers is their GCD. So, the first step is probably to find the GCD of 2002 and 44444.\n\nAlright, let me try to compute the GCD of 2002 and 44444. I'll use the Euclidean algorithm because it's efficient for this purpose. The Euclidean algorithm involves dividing the larger number by the smaller one and then replacing the larger number with the smaller number and the smaller number with the remainder from the division, repeating this process until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder will be the GCD.\n\nSo, let's start with 44444 and 2002.\n\nFirst, divide 44444 by 2002. Let me see how many times 2002 fits into 44444.\n\nCalculating 2002 * 20 = 40,040. Then, 44444 - 40,040 = 4,404. Wait, that seems too big. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, 2002 * 20 is indeed 40,040. So, 44444 - 40,040 = 4,404. Hmm, so the remainder is 4,404. So, now I replace the numbers: GCD(2002, 44444) becomes GCD(2002, 4,404).\n\nNext step, divide 2002 by 4,404. Wait, but 2002 is smaller than 4,404, so I should actually swap them. So, it's GCD(4,404, 2002).\n\nNow, divide 4,404 by 2002. Let me see, 2002 * 2 = 4,004. So, subtracting that from 4,404 gives 4,404 - 4,004 = 400. So, the remainder is 400. Now, we replace the numbers again: GCD(2002, 400).\n\nNow, compute GCD(2002, 400). Divide 2002 by 400. 400 * 5 = 2,000. So, 2002 - 2,000 = 2. So, the remainder is 2. Now, the problem becomes GCD(400, 2).\n\nDivide 400 by 2. 2 goes into 400 exactly 200 times with no remainder. So, the remainder is 0. The last non-zero remainder was 2, so the GCD of 2002 and 44444 is 2.\n\nWait, that seems correct? Let me double-check my calculations because I don't want to make a mistake here.\n\nStarting again:\n\n44444 \u00f7 2002: Let's see, 2002 * 20 is 40,040. 44444 - 40,040 = 4,404. So, first step gives remainder 4,404.\n\nThen, 2002 \u00f7 4,404: Since 2002 is less than 4,404, we take 4,404 \u00f7 2002. 2002 * 2 = 4,004. 4,404 - 4,004 = 400. So, remainder 400.\n\nNext, 2002 \u00f7 400: 400 * 5 = 2,000. 2002 - 2,000 = 2. So, remainder 2.\n\nThen, 400 \u00f7 2: 2 * 200 = 400, so remainder 0.\n\nYes, so the GCD is indeed 2.\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer that can be expressed as 2002m + 44444n is 2. But wait, the problem says \"the smallest positive integer,\" so 2 is correct? Or is there a smaller positive integer? Well, since the GCD is 2, the smallest positive integer is 2, because any linear combination will be a multiple of 2. So, 2 is the minimal positive integer in that form.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, maybe I can find specific integers m and n such that 2002m + 44444n = 2. Let me try to find such m and n.\n\nUsing the extended Euclidean algorithm, which not only finds the GCD but also expresses it as a linear combination of the two numbers.\n\nSo, let's work backwards from the Euclidean algorithm steps we did earlier.\n\nWe had:\n\n44444 = 2002 * 22 + 4,404. Wait, no, earlier I think I messed up the first step. Let me redo the Euclidean algorithm more carefully.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the first division. Let me correct that.\n\nWait, 44444 \u00f7 2002: Let me compute how many times 2002 goes into 44444.\n\n2002 * 20 = 40,040, as I had before. 44444 - 40,040 = 4,404. So, 44444 = 2002 * 20 + 4,404. So, remainder r1 = 4,404.\n\nNext step: GCD(2002, 4,404). So, 4,404 \u00f7 2002: 2002 * 2 = 4,004. 4,404 - 4,004 = 400. So, 4,404 = 2002 * 2 + 400. Remainder r2 = 400.\n\nNext step: GCD(2002, 400). So, 2002 \u00f7 400: 400 * 5 = 2,000. 2002 - 2,000 = 2. So, 2002 = 400 * 5 + 2. Remainder r3 = 2.\n\nNext step: GCD(400, 2). 400 \u00f7 2 = 200 with remainder 0. So, GCD is 2.\n\nNow, to express 2 as a linear combination of 2002 and 44444, we can backtrack.\n\nFrom the third step: 2 = 2002 - 400 * 5.\n\nBut 400 is from the second step: 400 = 4,404 - 2002 * 2.\n\nSubstituting into the equation for 2:\n\n2 = 2002 - (4,404 - 2002 * 2) * 5\n= 2002 - 4,404 * 5 + 2002 * 10\n= 2002 * (1 + 10) + 4,404 * (-5)\n= 2002 * 11 + 4,404 * (-5).\n\nBut 4,404 is from the first step: 4,404 = 44444 - 2002 * 20.\n\nSubstituting that into the equation:\n\n2 = 2002 * 11 + (44444 - 2002 * 20) * (-5)\n= 2002 * 11 + 44444 * (-5) - 2002 * 100\n= 2002 * (11 - 100) + 44444 * (-5)\n= 2002 * (-89) + 44444 * (-5).\n\nSo, that gives us m = -89 and n = -5.\n\nWait, so 2002*(-89) + 44444*(-5) = 2. Let me check that:\n\n2002 * (-89) = let's compute 2002*80=160,160 and 2002*9=18,018, so total 160,160 + 18,018 = 178,178. So, 2002*(-89) = -178,178.\n\n44444*(-5) = -222,220.\n\nAdding them: -178,178 + (-222,220) = -178,178 - 222,220 = -399,398 + 2? Wait, that can't be right because we should get 2, not -399,398. Wait, did I make a mistake in the calculation?\n\nWait, no, perhaps I made an error in the substitution. Let me double-check the substitution steps.\n\nWait, from the third step: 2 = 2002 - 400 * 5.\n\nBut 400 = 4,404 - 2002 * 2. So substituting, 2 = 2002 - (4,404 - 2002*2)*5.\n\nExpanding that: 2 = 2002 - 4,404*5 + 2002*10.\n\nCombining like terms: 2002*(1 + 10) = 2002*11, and -4,404*5. So, 2 = 2002*11 - 4,404*5.\n\nNow, 4,404 is equal to 44444 - 2002*20, from the first step. So substituting again:\n\n2 = 2002*11 - (44444 - 2002*20)*5.\n\nExpanding that: 2 = 2002*11 - 44444*5 + 2002*100.\n\nCombining like terms: 2002*(11 + 100) = 2002*111, and -44444*5. So, 2 = 2002*111 - 44444*5.\n\nWait, that seems different from before. So, m = 111 and n = -5.\n\nWait, so 2002*111 + 44444*(-5) = 2.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n2002 * 111: Let's compute 2000*111 = 222,000, and 2*111 = 222, so total is 222,000 + 222 = 222,222.\n\n44444 * (-5) = -222,220.\n\nSo, 222,222 - 222,220 = 2. Yes, that works. So, m = 111 and n = -5.\n\nWait, so that means 2 is indeed expressible as 2002*111 + 44444*(-5), which confirms that 2 is the smallest positive integer in that form.\n\nTherefore, the smallest positive integer is 2.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, is there a way to get a positive integer smaller than 2? Since the GCD is 2, the possible linear combinations are multiples of 2, so the smallest positive integer would be 2. There can't be a positive integer smaller than 2 because 1 is not a multiple of 2. So, 2 is indeed the smallest.\n\nSo, the answer is 2.\n</think>\n\nThe smallest positive integer that can be written in the form \\(2002m + 44444n\\) is their greatest common divisor (GCD). Using the Euclidean algorithm, we find that GCD(2002, 44444) is 2. Therefore, the smallest positive integer is 2.\n\n\\boxed{2}",
