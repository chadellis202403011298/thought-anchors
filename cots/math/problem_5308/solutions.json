Problem: Let $N$ be the number of ways to write $2010$ in the form $2010 = a_3 \\cdot 10^3 + a_2 \\cdot 10^2 + a_1 \\cdot 10 + a_0$, where the $a_i$'s are integers, and $0 \\le a_i \\le 99$. An example of such a representation is $1\\cdot 10^3 + 3\\cdot 10^2 + 67\\cdot 10^1 + 40\\cdot 10^0$. Find $N$.\n Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the number of ways to write 2010 in the form \\(2010 = a_3 \\cdot 10^3 + a_2 \\cdot 10^2 + a_1 \\cdot 10 + a_0\\), where each \\(a_i\\) is an integer between 0 and 99 inclusive. Hmm, this seems like a problem where I can use some combinatorial methods, maybe stars and bars or something similar. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's rewrite the equation to make it clearer. The given equation is:\n\n\\[2010 = a_3 \\cdot 1000 + a_2 \\cdot 100 + a_1 \\cdot 10 + a_0\\]\n\nEach \\(a_i\\) is between 0 and 99. So, all the coefficients are non-negative integers with an upper bound. This is similar to finding the number of non-negative integer solutions to an equation with constraints.\n\nLet me try to express this in a more standard form. If I let each \\(a_i\\) be variables, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[1000a_3 + 100a_2 + 10a_1 + a_0 = 2010\\]\n\nWith the constraints:\n\n\\[0 \\leq a_3, a_2, a_1, a_0 \\leq 99\\]\n\nSince all the coefficients are non-negative and bounded, I can model this as a problem of finding the number of non-negative integer solutions to the above equation with the given constraints.\n\nBut wait, this seems a bit complicated because the coefficients (1000, 100, 10, 1) are not the same, and the variables are bounded. Maybe I can break this problem down by considering each digit place separately. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider each \\(a_i\\) as a digit in a base-100 number system, since each \\(a_i\\) can go up to 99. That might help in breaking down the problem.\n\nWait, another thought: If I rewrite the equation as:\n\n\\[a_3 \\cdot 1000 + a_2 \\cdot 100 + a_1 \\cdot 10 + a_0 = 2010\\]\n\nI can consider each term as contributing to different places, similar to how digits contribute in base 10, but here the 'digits' can go up to 99. So, maybe I can model this as a base-100 decomposition.\n\nBut perhaps a more straightforward approach is to consider each variable \\(a_3, a_2, a_1, a_0\\) and express the equation as a linear Diophantine equation with constraints.\n\nLet me consider the equation:\n\n\\[1000a_3 + 100a_2 + 10a_1 + a_0 = 2010\\]\n\nSince all \\(a_i\\) are non-negative integers and bounded above by 99, I can think of this as a problem where I need to distribute the value 2010 across four variables with each variable having a maximum capacity of 99.\n\nBut the problem is that the coefficients (1000, 100, 10, 1) complicate things because they are not uniform. So, perhaps I can perform a substitution to make the coefficients more manageable.\n\nLet me try to express each term in terms of 10:\n\n\\[1000a_3 = 10 \\cdot 100a_3\\]\n\\[100a_2 = 10 \\cdot 10a_2\\]\n\\[10a_1 = 10 \\cdot a_1\\]\n\\[a_0 = 10 \\cdot \\frac{a_0}{10}\\]\n\nWait, that might not be helpful because \\(a_0\\) isn't necessarily a multiple of 10. Alternatively, perhaps I can factor out 10:\n\n\\[10(100a_3 + 10a_2 + a_1) + a_0 = 2010\\]\n\nWhich gives:\n\n\\[10(100a_3 + 10a_2 + a_1) = 2010 - a_0\\]\n\nSo, \\(2010 - a_0\\) must be divisible by 10. Since \\(a_0\\) is between 0 and 99, \\(2010 - a_0\\) will be between 1911 and 2010. But since 2010 is divisible by 10, and \\(a_0\\) is between 0 and 99, \\(a_0\\) must also be such that \\(2010 - a_0\\) is divisible by 10. Therefore, \\(a_0\\) must be congruent to 0 modulo 10. So, \\(a_0\\) can be 0, 10, 20, ..., 90. That gives 10 possible values for \\(a_0\\).\n\nWait, let me check that again. Since \\(2010\\) is divisible by 10, subtracting \\(a_0\\) must still leave the result divisible by 10. Therefore, \\(a_0\\) must be congruent to 0 mod 10, so \\(a_0\\) can be 0, 10, 20, ..., up to 90. Since 90 is less than 99, that's correct. So, 10 possible values for \\(a_0\\).\n\nSo, for each possible value of \\(a_0\\), we can write:\n\n\\[100a_3 + 10a_2 + a_1 = \\frac{2010 - a_0}{10}\\]\n\nLet me denote \\(b = \\frac{2010 - a_0}{10}\\). Then, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[100a_3 + 10a_2 + a_1 = b\\]\n\nWhere \\(a_3, a_2, a_1\\) are integers between 0 and 99 inclusive.\n\nSo, for each \\(a_0\\) (which can take 10 values), we need to find the number of non-negative integer solutions to \\(100a_3 + 10a_2 + a_1 = b\\), with \\(0 \\leq a_3, a_2, a_1 \\leq 99\\).\n\nSo, our problem reduces to finding, for each \\(a_0\\), the number of solutions \\(N(b)\\) to the equation \\(100a_3 + 10a_2 + a_1 = b\\), and then summing \\(N(b)\\) over all possible \\(a_0\\).\n\nBut since \\(a_0\\) can only take 10 values, each corresponding to a unique \\(b\\), we can compute \\(N(b)\\) for each \\(b = \\frac{2010 - a_0}{10}\\) and then sum them up.\n\nSo, let's express \\(b\\) in terms of \\(a_0\\). Since \\(a_0\\) is 0, 10, 20, ..., 90, \\(b = 201 - \\frac{a_0}{10}\\). Therefore, \\(b\\) will take the values 201, 191, 181, ..., 111. So, \\(b\\) decreases by 10 each time \\(a_0\\) increases by 10.\n\nTherefore, for each \\(b\\) from 111 to 201 in steps of 10, we need to compute \\(N(b)\\), the number of solutions to \\(100a_3 + 10a_2 + a_1 = b\\) with \\(0 \\leq a_3, a_2, a_1 \\leq 99\\).\n\nSo, the total number of solutions \\(N\\) is the sum of \\(N(b)\\) for \\(b = 111, 121, 131, ..., 201\\).\n\nNow, let's focus on computing \\(N(b)\\) for each \\(b\\). Let's consider the equation:\n\n\\[100a_3 + 10a_2 + a_1 = b\\]\n\nWe can think of this as a problem of finding the number of non-negative integer solutions to this equation with each \\(a_i \\leq 99\\).\n\nOne approach is to fix \\(a_3\\) first, then for each fixed \\(a_3\\), fix \\(a_2\\), and then \\(a_1\\) is determined. However, we need to make sure that \\(a_1\\) is within 0 to 99.\n\nAlternatively, since the coefficients are 100, 10, and 1, we can model this as a problem where each variable contributes to different 'digits' in base 10, but with the variables allowed to go up to 99. Hmm, maybe another substitution can help.\n\nLet me try to rewrite the equation as:\n\n\\[a_1 = b - 100a_3 - 10a_2\\]\n\nSince \\(a_1\\) must be between 0 and 99, we have:\n\n\\[0 \\leq b - 100a_3 - 10a_2 \\leq 99\\]\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\n\\[b - 99 \\leq 100a_3 + 10a_2 \\leq b\\]\n\nSo, for each \\(b\\), we need to find the number of pairs \\((a_3, a_2)\\) such that:\n\n\\[100a_3 + 10a_2 \\leq b \\leq 100a_3 + 10a_2 + 99\\]\n\nBut this seems a bit abstract. Maybe another approach is better.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the equation \\(100a_3 + 10a_2 + a_1 = b\\). Let me think of this as a linear equation in three variables with constraints.\n\nFirst, \\(a_3\\) can range from 0 to \\(\\lfloor \\frac{b}{100} \\rfloor\\). For each value of \\(a_3\\), \\(a_2\\) can range from 0 to \\(\\lfloor \\frac{b - 100a_3}{10} \\rfloor\\), and then \\(a_1\\) is determined as \\(b - 100a_3 - 10a_2\\), which must be between 0 and 99.\n\nTherefore, for each \\(a_3\\), the number of valid \\(a_2\\) is the number of integers \\(a_2\\) such that:\n\n\\[0 \\leq a_2 \\leq \\min\\left(\\left\\lfloor \\frac{b - 100a_3}{10} \\right\\rfloor, 99\\right)\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[0 \\leq b - 100a_3 - 10a_2 \\leq 99\\]\n\nBut since \\(a_1 = b - 100a_3 - 10a_2\\), we can write:\n\n\\[b - 100a_3 - 10a_2 \\geq 0 \\implies 10a_2 \\leq b - 100a_3\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[b - 100a_3 - 10a_2 \\leq 99 \\implies 10a_2 \\geq b - 100a_3 - 99\\]\n\nSo, combining these, for each \\(a_3\\), \\(a_2\\) must satisfy:\n\n\\[\\max\\left(0, \\left\\lceil \\frac{b - 100a_3 - 99}{10} \\right\\rceil\\right) \\leq a_2 \\leq \\min\\left(\\left\\lfloor \\frac{b - 100a_3}{10} \\right\\rfloor, 99\\right)\\]\n\nThe number of valid \\(a_2\\) for each \\(a_3\\) is then:\n\n\\[\\max\\left(0, \\left\\lfloor \\frac{b - 100a_3}{10} \\right\\rfloor - \\left\\lceil \\frac{b - 100a_3 - 99}{10} \\right\\rceil + 1\\right)\\]\n\nThis seems a bit complicated, but perhaps there's a better way. Alternatively, notice that \\(a_1\\) must be between 0 and 99, so for each \\(a_3\\), \\(10a_2\\) must be between \\(b - 100a_3 - 99\\) and \\(b - 100a_3\\). Therefore, the number of \\(a_2\\) is the number of integers in the interval \\([ (b - 100a_3 - 99)/10, (b - 100a_3)/10 ]\\).\n\nBut since \\(a_2\\) must be an integer, the number of valid \\(a_2\\) is the floor of the upper bound minus the ceiling of the lower bound plus 1, provided that the lower bound is less than or equal to the upper bound.\n\nSo, for each \\(a_3\\), the number of \\(a_2\\) is:\n\n\\[\\left\\lfloor \\frac{b - 100a_3}{10} \\right\\rfloor - \\left\\lceil \\frac{b - 100a_3 - 99}{10} \\right\\rceil + 1\\]\n\nIf this value is positive; otherwise, it's zero.\n\nThis expression can be simplified. Let's compute the difference:\n\n\\[\\left\\lfloor \\frac{b - 100a_3}{10} \\right\\rfloor - \\left\\lceil \\frac{b - 100a_3 - 99}{10} \\right\\rceil + 1\\]\n\nLet me denote \\(c = b - 100a_3\\). Then, the expression becomes:\n\n\\[\\left\\lfloor \\frac{c}{10} \\right\\rfloor - \\left\\lceil \\frac{c - 99}{10} \\right\\rceil + 1\\]\n\nLet me compute this:\n\nFirst, \\(\\left\\lfloor \\frac{c}{10} \\right\\rfloor\\) is the integer division of \\(c\\) by 10.\n\nSecond, \\(\\left\\lceil \\frac{c - 99}{10} \\right\\rceil\\) is the ceiling of \\((c - 99)/10\\).\n\nSo, the difference is:\n\n\\[\\left\\lfloor \\frac{c}{10} \\right\\rfloor - \\left\\lceil \\frac{c - 99}{10} \\right\\rceil + 1\\]\n\nLet me compute this for different values of \\(c\\).\n\nNote that \\(c = b - 100a_3\\). Since \\(b\\) ranges from 111 to 201, and \\(a_3\\) can be 0, 1, or 2 because \\(100a_3 \\leq b \\leq 201\\). So, \\(a_3\\) can be 0, 1, or 2.\n\nLet's consider each possible \\(a_3\\) value and see how \\(c\\) behaves.\n\nCase 1: \\(a_3 = 0\\)\n\nThen, \\(c = b\\), which ranges from 111 to 201.\n\nSo, the expression becomes:\n\n\\[\\left\\lfloor \\frac{b}{10} \\right\\rfloor - \\left\\lceil \\frac{b - 99}{10} \\right\\rceil + 1\\]\n\nLet me compute this:\n\nLet me denote \\(d = \\frac{b}{10}\\). Since \\(b\\) is from 111 to 201, \\(d\\) is from 11.1 to 20.1.\n\nSo, \\(\\left\\lfloor d \\right\\rfloor = \\lfloor d \\rfloor\\), and \\(\\left\\lceil \\frac{b - 99}{10} \\right\\rceil = \\left\\lceil \\frac{b}{10} - 9.9 \\right\\rceil = \\left\\lceil d - 9.9 \\right\\rceil\\).\n\nSo, \\(\\left\\lfloor d \\right\\rfloor - \\left\\lceil d - 9.9 \\right\\rceil + 1\\).\n\nLet me compute this for different ranges of \\(d\\):\n\nSince \\(d\\) is from 11.1 to 20.1, let's split it into two parts: 11.1 to 19.9 and 20.0 to 20.1.\n\nWait, actually, since \\(d\\) is 11.1 up to 20.1, but in reality, \\(b\\) is an integer, so \\(d = b/10\\) will be multiples of 0.1, but \\(b\\) is an integer, so \\(d\\) is an integer plus 0.1, 0.2, etc., depending on the last digit.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to note that \\(b\\) is an integer, so \\(c = b - 100a_3\\) is also an integer.\n\nTherefore, \\(c\\) is an integer from 111 - 0 = 111 down to 201 - 200 = 1, but in our case, \\(a_3\\) can be 0,1,2, so \\(c\\) can be from 111 down to 1 (if \\(a_3=2\\), then \\(c = 201 - 200 = 1\\)).\n\nWait, but for each \\(a_3\\), \\(c = b - 100a_3\\), and \\(b\\) is from 111 to 201 in steps of 10. So, for each \\(a_3\\), \\(c\\) can take certain values.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try specific values for \\(a_3\\).\n\nCase 1: \\(a_3 = 0\\)\n\nThen, \\(c = b\\). So, \\(c\\) ranges from 111 to 201, but \\(b\\) is in steps of 10, so \\(c\\) is 111, 121, 131, ..., 201.\n\nSo, for each \\(c\\) in 111,121,...,201:\n\nNumber of \\(a_2\\) is:\n\n\\[\\left\\lfloor \\frac{c}{10} \\right\\rfloor - \\left\\lceil \\frac{c - 99}{10} \\right\\rceil + 1\\]\n\nLet me compute this for \\(c = 111\\):\n\n\\[\\left\\lfloor 11.1 \\right\\rfloor = 11\\]\n\\[\\left\\lceil \\frac{111 - 99}{10} \\right\\rceil = \\left\\lceil \\frac{12}{10} \\right\\rceil = \\left\\lceil 1.2 \\right\\rceil = 2\\]\nSo, 11 - 2 + 1 = 10.\n\nSimilarly, for \\(c = 121\\):\n\n\\[\\left\\lfloor 12.1 \\right\\rfloor = 12\\]\n\\[\\left\\lceil \\frac{121 - 99}{10} \\right\\rceil = \\left\\lceil \\frac{22}{10} \\right\\rceil = \\left\\lceil 2.2 \\right\\rceil = 3\\]\nSo, 12 - 3 + 1 = 10.\n\nWait, let's see another one: \\(c = 131\\):\n\n\\[\\left\\lfloor 13.1 \\right\\rfloor = 13\\]\n\\[\\left\\lceil \\frac{131 - 99}{10} \\right\\rceil = \\left\\lceil \\frac{32}{10} \\right\\rceil = \\left\\lceil 3.2 \\right\\rceil = 4\\]\nSo, 13 - 4 + 1 = 10.\n\nHmm, seems like for each \\(c\\), this expression gives 10. Let me check \\(c = 201\\):\n\n\\[\\left\\lfloor 20.1 \\right\\rfloor = 20\\]\n\\[\\left\\lceil \\frac{201 - 99}{10} \\right\\rceil = \\left\\lceil \\frac{102}{10} \\right\\rceil = \\left\\lceil 10.2 \\right\\rceil = 11\\]\nSo, 20 - 11 + 1 = 10.\n\nWow, so for \\(a_3 = 0\\), each \\(c = b\\) (which is 111,121,...,201) gives exactly 10 solutions for \\(a_2\\). Therefore, for each \\(a_3=0\\), there are 10 possible \\(a_2\\), each leading to a valid \\(a_1\\). So, the number of solutions when \\(a_3=0\\) is 10.\n\nBut wait, actually, for each \\(a_3=0\\), it's 10 solutions, but \\(a_3\\) is fixed at 0, so the number of solutions is 10. However, in our case, \\(a_3\\) is being varied, but in this case, \\(a_3=0\\) contributes 10 solutions for each \\(b\\). Wait, no, actually, for each \\(b\\), when \\(a_3=0\\), it's 10 solutions. But in our case, we're considering each \\(b\\) separately, so for each \\(b\\), \\(a_3\\) can be 0,1,2.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think differently. For each \\(b\\), we can have \\(a_3 = 0,1,2\\), and for each \\(a_3\\), we compute the number of \\(a_2\\). So, for each \\(b\\), the total number of solutions \\(N(b)\\) is the sum over \\(a_3=0,1,2\\) of the number of \\(a_2\\) for each \\(a_3\\).\n\nSo, for each \\(b\\), let's compute \\(N(b)\\):\n\nStart with \\(a_3=0\\):\n\nNumber of \\(a_2\\) is 10, as above.\n\nThen, \\(a_3=1\\):\n\nThen, \\(c = b - 100\\). Since \\(b\\) ranges from 111 to 201, \\(c\\) will range from 111 - 100 = 11 to 201 - 100 = 101.\n\nBut \\(c\\) must be such that \\(c = b - 100a_3\\), and \\(a_2\\) must satisfy:\n\n\\[\\left\\lfloor \\frac{c}{10} \\right\\rfloor - \\left\\lceil \\frac{c - 99}{10} \\right\\rceil + 1\\]\n\nBut let's compute this for \\(c\\) from 11 to 101.\n\nWait, but \\(c = b - 100\\), and \\(b\\) is 111,121,...,201. So, \\(c\\) is 11,21,...,101.\n\nSo, for each \\(c\\) in 11,21,...,101:\n\nNumber of \\(a_2\\) is:\n\n\\[\\left\\lfloor \\frac{c}{10} \\right\\rfloor - \\left\\lceil \\frac{c - 99}{10} \\right\\rceil + 1\\]\n\nLet's compute this for \\(c=11\\):\n\n\\[\\left\\lfloor 1.1 \\right\\rfloor = 1\\]\n\\[\\left\\lceil \\frac{11 - 99}{10} \\right\\rceil = \\left\\lceil \\frac{-88}{10} \\right\\rceil = \\left\\lceil -8.8 \\right\\rceil = -8\\]\nSo, 1 - (-8) + 1 = 10.\n\nSimilarly, \\(c=21\\):\n\n\\[\\left\\lfloor 2.1 \\right\\rfloor = 2\\]\n\\[\\left\\lceil \\frac{21 - 99}{10} \\right\\rceil = \\left\\lceil \\frac{-78}{10} \\right\\rceil = \\left\\lceil -7.8 \\right\\rceil = -7\\]\nSo, 2 - (-7) + 1 = 10.\n\nSame for \\(c=31\\):\n\n\\[\\left\\lfloor 3.1 \\right\\rfloor = 3\\]\n\\[\\left\\lceil \\frac{31 - 99}{10} \\right\\rceil = \\left\\lceil -6.8 \\right\\rceil = -6\\]\nSo, 3 - (-6) + 1 = 10.\n\nContinuing this pattern, for each \\(c = 11,21,...,101\\), the number of \\(a_2\\) is 10.\n\nTherefore, for \\(a_3=1\\), each \\(c = 11,21,...,101\\) gives 10 solutions. So, for each \\(b\\), when \\(a_3=1\\), the number of \\(a_2\\) is 10.\n\nSimilarly, for \\(a_3=2\\):\n\nThen, \\(c = b - 200\\). Since \\(b\\) is from 111 to 201, \\(c = b - 200\\) will be from 111 - 200 = -89 to 201 - 200 = 1.\n\nBut \\(c\\) must be non-negative because \\(a_1 = c - 10a_2\\) must be non-negative. Wait, no, \\(c = b - 200a_3\\), which in this case is \\(b - 200\\). But \\(b\\) is 111,121,...,201. So, \\(c\\) will be negative for \\(b < 200\\), but \\(b\\) can be 201, so \\(c = 1\\).\n\nWait, but \\(a_3=2\\) implies \\(c = b - 200\\). So, for \\(b = 201\\), \\(c=1\\). For \\(b=191\\), \\(c= -9\\), which is invalid because \\(c = b - 200\\) must be non-negative for \\(a_2\\) and \\(a_1\\) to be non-negative. Therefore, \\(a_3=2\\) is only possible when \\(b \\geq 200\\). But our \\(b\\) only goes up to 201, so only \\(b=201\\) allows \\(a_3=2\\).\n\nTherefore, for \\(b=201\\), \\(a_3=2\\) gives \\(c=1\\). Then, number of \\(a_2\\) is:\n\n\\[\\left\\lfloor \\frac{1}{10} \\right\\rfloor - \\left\\lceil \\frac{1 - 99}{10} \\right\\rceil + 1 = 0 - \\left\\lceil \\frac{-98}{10} \\right\\rceil + 1 = 0 - (-10) + 1 = 11\\]\n\nWait, but \\(a_2\\) must satisfy \\(0 \\leq a_2 \\leq 99\\). So, let's check:\n\nIf \\(c=1\\), then \\(10a_2 \\leq 1\\), so \\(a_2 = 0\\). Then, \\(a_1 = 1 - 0 = 1\\), which is valid. So, only one solution.\n\nBut according to the formula, it gave 11, which is incorrect. Hmm, so maybe my formula is wrong.\n\nWait, let's compute it manually for \\(c=1\\):\n\nWe have \\(10a_2 \\leq 1\\) and \\(10a_2 \\geq 1 - 99 = -98\\).\n\nBut since \\(a_2\\) is non-negative, \\(a_2\\) can only be 0. Therefore, only one solution.\n\nSo, my formula must be wrong. Maybe I need to adjust it.\n\nWait, let's reconsider the formula:\n\nNumber of \\(a_2\\) is:\n\n\\[\\max\\left(0, \\left\\lfloor \\frac{c}{10} \\right\\rfloor - \\left\\lceil \\frac{c - 99}{10} \\right\\rceil + 1\\right)\\]\n\nBut in this case, \\(c=1\\):\n\n\\[\\left\\lfloor \\frac{1}{10} \\right\\rfloor = 0\\]\n\\[\\left\\lceil \\frac{1 - 99}{10} \\right\\rceil = \\left\\lceil \\frac{-98}{10} \\right\\rceil = \\left\\lceil -9.8 \\right\\rceil = -9\\]\nSo, \\(0 - (-9) + 1 = 10\\), but actual solutions are 1. So, the formula overcounts when \\(c\\) is small.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the formula isn't correct for all cases. Maybe I need to adjust it.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about the constraints:\n\nFor \\(a_3=2\\), \\(c = b - 200\\). So, \\(c\\) must be non-negative because \\(a_1 = c - 10a_2\\) must be non-negative. Therefore, \\(c \\geq 0\\). So, \\(b \\geq 200\\). But our \\(b\\) only goes up to 201, so only \\(b=200\\) and \\(b=201\\) can have \\(a_3=2\\). But in our case, \\(b\\) is 111,121,...,201, so only \\(b=200\\) and \\(b=201\\) would have \\(a_3=2\\), but 200 is not in our list since \\(b\\) is from 111 to 201 in steps of 10, which would include 200. Wait, no, 200 is 200, which is 200, but our \\(b\\) is \\(2010 - a_0\\)/10, and \\(a_0\\) is 0,10,...,90, so \\(b = 201,191,...,111\\). So, 200 is not included because \\(a_0\\) is 10, so \\(b=201 -10=191, etc. Wait, actually, when \\(a_0=10\\), \\(b=201 -10=191\\); when \\(a_0=20\\), \\(b=201 -20=181\\), and so on, down to \\(a_0=90\\), \\(b=201 -90=111\\). So, 200 is not among the \\(b\\) values because \\(a_0\\) can't be 1 to make \\(b=200\\), since \\(a_0\\) is in steps of 10.\n\nWait, but actually, \\(a_0\\) can be 0,10,...,90, so \\(b=201,191,...,111\\). So, \\(b=200\\) is not included. Therefore, the only \\(b\\) where \\(a_3=2\\) is possible is \\(b=201\\), because \\(c=201 - 200=1\\), which is non-negative.\n\nSo, for \\(b=201\\), \\(a_3=2\\) gives \\(c=1\\), and as we saw earlier, only one solution: \\(a_2=0\\), \\(a_1=1\\).\n\nTherefore, for \\(b=201\\), \\(a_3=2\\) contributes 1 solution.\n\nSimilarly, for other \\(b\\) values, \\(a_3=2\\) would require \\(c = b - 200 \\geq 0\\), but since \\(b \\leq 201\\), only \\(b=201\\) allows \\(a_3=2\\).\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\nFor each \\(b\\) from 111 to 201 in steps of 10:\n\n- \\(a_3=0\\): 10 solutions\n- \\(a_3=1\\): 10 solutions\n- \\(a_3=2\\): 1 solution if \\(b=201\\), else 0\n\nTherefore, for \\(b=201\\), \\(N(b) = 10 + 10 + 1 = 21\\).\n\nFor all other \\(b\\) (111,121,...,191,201 except 201), \\(N(b) = 10 + 10 = 20\\).\n\nWait, but 201 is the only \\(b\\) where \\(a_3=2\\) contributes, so for \\(b=201\\), \\(N(b)=21\\), and for the other 9 \\(b\\)s (111,121,...,191), \\(N(b)=20\\).\n\nTherefore, total \\(N\\) is:\n\nNumber of \\(b\\)s: 10 (from 111 to 201 in steps of 10).\n\nOf these, 1 \\(b\\) (201) has \\(N(b)=21\\), and 9 \\(b\\)s have \\(N(b)=20\\).\n\nTherefore, total number of solutions is:\n\n\\(1 \\times 21 + 9 \\times 20 = 21 + 180 = 201\\).\n\nWait, that seems interesting. So, the total number of solutions is 201.\n\nBut let me double-check this. For each \\(a_0\\) (10 values), we have \\(N(b)\\) solutions. So, total \\(N = \\sum_{a_0} N(b)\\).\n\nBut we have 10 \\(a_0\\)s, each corresponding to a \\(b\\). For each \\(b\\), \\(N(b)\\) is 20 or 21. Specifically, for \\(b=201\\), \\(N(b)=21\\), and for the other 9 \\(b\\)s, \\(N(b)=20\\). Therefore, total \\(N = 21 + 9 \\times 20 = 21 + 180 = 201\\).\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways is 201.\n\nBut let me think again: for each \\(a_0\\), which has 10 possibilities, we have a corresponding \\(b\\), and for each \\(b\\), we have \\(N(b)\\) solutions. So, total \\(N = \\sum_{a_0} N(b)\\).\n\nBut in our case, each \\(a_0\\) corresponds to a unique \\(b\\), and we have 10 \\(b\\)s. For each \\(b\\), \\(N(b)\\) is either 20 or 21, as above.\n\nSo, total \\(N = 21 + 9 \\times 20 = 201\\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 201.\n\nBut wait, let me think if this makes sense. The problem is similar to writing 2010 in a base-100 system, but with digits allowed up to 99. So, each digit can be from 0 to 99, and we're writing 2010 as a combination of these digits multiplied by powers of 10.\n\nBut another way to think about it",
