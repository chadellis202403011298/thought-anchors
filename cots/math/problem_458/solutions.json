Problem: Find the sum of the $x$-coordinates of the solutions to the system of equations $y=|x^2-6x+5|$ and $y=\\frac{29}{4}-x$. Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the sum of the x-coordinates of the solutions to the system of equations y = |x\u00b2 - 6x + 5| and y = (29/4) - x. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that when dealing with absolute value functions, I need to consider the expression inside the absolute value, which is x\u00b2 - 6x + 5. I should probably factor that to understand where it's positive and where it's negative because the absolute value will affect the graph accordingly.\n\nLet me factor x\u00b2 - 6x + 5. Looking for two numbers that multiply to 5 and add up to -6. That would be -1 and -5, right? So, x\u00b2 - 6x + 5 factors to (x - 1)(x - 5). So, the expression inside the absolute value is zero at x = 1 and x = 5.\n\nNow, to find where the expression inside the absolute value is positive or negative, I can test intervals around the roots. The critical points are at x = 1 and x = 5.\n\nSo, for x < 1, let's pick x = 0: (0 - 1)(0 - 5) = (-1)(-5) = 5, which is positive. So, for x < 1, the expression is positive.\n\nBetween x = 1 and x = 5, let's pick x = 3: (3 - 1)(3 - 5) = (2)(-2) = -4, which is negative. So, in this interval, the expression is negative.\n\nFor x > 5, let's pick x = 6: (6 - 1)(6 - 5) = (5)(1) = 5, which is positive again.\n\nTherefore, the absolute value function y = |x\u00b2 - 6x + 5| can be written as a piecewise function:\n\n- For x \u2264 1 and x \u2265 5, y = x\u00b2 - 6x + 5\n- For 1 < x < 5, y = -(x\u00b2 - 6x + 5) = -x\u00b2 + 6x - 5\n\nSo, now I have two cases to consider when solving the system with y = (29/4) - x.\n\nCase 1: y = x\u00b2 - 6x + 5 and y = (29/4) - x, where x \u2264 1 or x \u2265 5.\n\nCase 2: y = -x\u00b2 + 6x - 5 and y = (29/4) - x, where 1 < x < 5.\n\nI'll solve each case separately.\n\nStarting with Case 1: x\u00b2 - 6x + 5 = (29/4) - x\n\nLet me rearrange this equation to bring all terms to one side:\n\nx\u00b2 - 6x + 5 - (29/4) + x = 0\n\nSimplify like terms:\n\nx\u00b2 - 5x + 5 - 29/4 = 0\n\nWait, 5 is 20/4, so 20/4 - 29/4 = -9/4.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\nx\u00b2 - 5x - 9/4 = 0\n\nTo make it easier, I can multiply all terms by 4 to eliminate the fraction:\n\n4x\u00b2 - 20x - 9 = 0\n\nNow, I can use the quadratic formula to solve for x. The quadratic is in the form ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0, so a = 4, b = -20, c = -9.\n\nThe quadratic formula is x = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 - 4ac)] / (2a)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nx = [20 \u00b1 sqrt((-20)\u00b2 - 4*4*(-9))] / (2*4)\n\nCalculate discriminant D:\n\nD = 400 - 4*4*(-9) = 400 + 144 = 544\n\nSo, sqrt(544). Let me see, 544 divided by 16 is 34, so sqrt(544) = sqrt(16*34) = 4*sqrt(34)\n\nSo, x = [20 \u00b1 4\u221a34] / 8\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator by dividing numerator and denominator by 4:\n\nx = [5 \u00b1 \u221a34] / 2\n\nSo, the solutions for Case 1 are x = (5 + \u221a34)/2 and x = (5 - \u221a34)/2.\n\nNow, I need to check if these solutions fall into the domain of Case 1, which is x \u2264 1 or x \u2265 5.\n\nLet me approximate \u221a34. \u221a25 is 5, \u221a36 is 6, so \u221a34 is approximately 5.830.\n\nSo, (5 + \u221a34)/2 \u2248 (5 + 5.830)/2 \u2248 10.830/2 \u2248 5.415. That's greater than 5, so it's valid for Case 1.\n\nNext, (5 - \u221a34)/2 \u2248 (5 - 5.830)/2 \u2248 (-0.830)/2 \u2248 -0.415. That's less than 1, so it's also valid for Case 1.\n\nSo, both solutions from Case 1 are valid.\n\nNow, moving on to Case 2: y = -x\u00b2 + 6x - 5 and y = (29/4) - x, where 1 < x < 5.\n\nSet them equal:\n\n-x\u00b2 + 6x - 5 = (29/4) - x\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n-x\u00b2 + 6x - 5 - (29/4) + x = 0\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n-x\u00b2 + 7x - 5 - 29/4 = 0\n\nConvert 5 to 20/4 to combine with 29/4:\n\n-x\u00b2 + 7x - (20/4 + 29/4) = -x\u00b2 + 7x - 49/4 = 0\n\nMultiply all terms by 4 to eliminate the fraction:\n\n-4x\u00b2 + 28x - 49 = 0\n\nMultiply both sides by -1 to make the coefficient of x\u00b2 positive:\n\n4x\u00b2 - 28x + 49 = 0\n\nNow, apply the quadratic formula again. a = 4, b = -28, c = 49.\n\nDiscriminant D = (-28)^2 - 4*4*49 = 784 - 784 = 0\n\nSo, D = 0, which means there's exactly one real solution, a double root.\n\nx = [28 \u00b1 sqrt(0)] / (2*4) = 28 / 8 = 3.5\n\nSo, x = 3.5, which is 7/2.\n\nNow, check if this solution is within the domain of Case 2, which is 1 < x < 5. Since 3.5 is between 1 and 5, it's valid.\n\nSo, Case 2 gives us one solution at x = 3.5.\n\nNow, let's summarize the solutions we've found:\n\nFrom Case 1: x \u2248 5.415 and x \u2248 -0.415\n\nFrom Case 2: x = 3.5\n\nWait, but I should express them exactly rather than approximately.\n\nFrom Case 1, the exact solutions are x = (5 + \u221a34)/2 and x = (5 - \u221a34)/2.\n\nFrom Case 2, the exact solution is x = 7/2.\n\nSo, the x-coordinates of the solutions are (5 + \u221a34)/2, (5 - \u221a34)/2, and 7/2.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the Case 2 solution. Let me plug x = 7/2 into both equations to make sure it works.\n\nFirst, y = |x\u00b2 - 6x + 5|.\n\nCompute x\u00b2: (7/2)^2 = 49/4\n\n6x: 6*(7/2) = 21\n\nSo, x\u00b2 - 6x + 5 = 49/4 - 21 + 5 = 49/4 - 21 + 5\n\nConvert 21 to 84/4 and 5 to 20/4:\n\n49/4 - 84/4 + 20/4 = (49 - 84 + 20)/4 = (-15)/4, which is negative. So, the absolute value would be 15/4.\n\nNow, y = (29/4) - x = (29/4) - (7/2) = 29/4 - 14/4 = 15/4. So, yes, it works.\n\nNow, let me check the solutions from Case 1.\n\nFirst, x = (5 + \u221a34)/2.\n\nCompute y = |x\u00b2 - 6x + 5|.\n\nBut since x \u2265 5, the expression inside is positive, so y = x\u00b2 - 6x + 5.\n\nNow, let me compute y = (29/4) - x.\n\nLet me compute both y-values to check if they are equal.\n\nAlternatively, since we solved the equation, they should be equal, but let me verify.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check by plugging into the original equations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check one of them.\n\nLet me take x = (5 + \u221a34)/2.\n\nCompute y from both equations.\n\nFrom y = |x\u00b2 - 6x + 5|, since x \u2265 5, y = x\u00b2 - 6x + 5.\n\nCompute x\u00b2: [(5 + \u221a34)/2]^2 = (25 + 10\u221a34 + 34)/4 = (59 + 10\u221a34)/4\n\n6x: 6*(5 + \u221a34)/2 = 3*(5 + \u221a34) = 15 + 3\u221a34\n\nSo, x\u00b2 - 6x + 5 = (59 + 10\u221a34)/4 - (15 + 3\u221a34) + 5\n\nConvert 15 to 60/4 and 5 to 20/4:\n\n= (59 + 10\u221a34)/4 - (60/4 + 12\u221a34/4) + 20/4\n\nCombine terms:\n\n= [59 + 10\u221a34 - 60 - 12\u221a34 + 20]/4\n\n= (59 - 60 + 20) + (10\u221a34 - 12\u221a34) all over 4\n\n= (19) + (-2\u221a34) all over 4\n\n= (19 - 2\u221a34)/4\n\nNow, compute y from the other equation: y = 29/4 - x\n\nx = (5 + \u221a34)/2, so:\n\ny = 29/4 - (5 + \u221a34)/2 = 29/4 - (10 + 2\u221a34)/4 = (29 - 10 - 2\u221a34)/4 = (19 - 2\u221a34)/4\n\nWhich matches the previous result. So, it checks out.\n\nSimilarly, for x = (5 - \u221a34)/2, which is approximately -0.415, let me check.\n\nSince x \u2264 1, the expression inside the absolute value is positive, so y = x\u00b2 - 6x + 5.\n\nCompute y from both equations.\n\nCompute y = x\u00b2 - 6x + 5.\n\nx = (5 - \u221a34)/2\n\nx\u00b2 = [(5 - \u221a34)/2]^2 = (25 - 10\u221a34 + 34)/4 = (59 - 10\u221a34)/4\n\n6x = 6*(5 - \u221a34)/2 = 3*(5 - \u221a34) = 15 - 3\u221a34\n\nSo, x\u00b2 - 6x + 5 = (59 - 10\u221a34)/4 - (15 - 3\u221a34) + 5\n\nConvert 15 to 60/4 and 5 to 20/4:\n\n= (59 - 10\u221a34)/4 - (60/4 - 12\u221a34/4) + 20/4\n\n= (59 - 10\u221a34)/4 - 60/4 + 12\u221a34/4 + 20/4\n\nCombine terms:\n\n= [59 - 60 + 20] + (-10\u221a34 + 12\u221a34) all over 4\n\n= (19) + (2\u221a34) all over 4\n\n= (19 + 2\u221a34)/4\n\nNow, compute y from the other equation: y = 29/4 - x\n\nx = (5 - \u221a34)/2, so:\n\ny = 29/4 - (5 - \u221a34)/2 = 29/4 - (10 - 2\u221a34)/4 = (29 - 10 + 2\u221a34)/4 = (19 + 2\u221a34)/4\n\nWhich matches, so that's correct.\n\nSo, all three solutions are valid.\n\nWait, but I thought maybe there's another solution in Case 2, but no, it's just one solution.\n\nWait, but let me think: when I solved Case 2, I got x = 3.5, which is 7/2, and that's the only solution in that interval.\n\nSo, in total, we have three x-coordinates: (5 + \u221a34)/2, (5 - \u221a34)/2, and 7/2.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me check if I made a mistake in the number of solutions. Because when dealing with absolute value functions and linear functions, sometimes there can be more intersections.\n\nWait, but in this case, the absolute value function y = |x\u00b2 - 6x + 5| is a V-shaped graph that's upward opening for x \u22641 and x \u22655, and downward opening between 1 and 5.\n\nThe line y = (29/4) - x is a straight line with a slope of -1 and y-intercept at 29/4, which is 7.25.\n\nSo, perhaps the line could intersect the absolute value graph in up to three points: two on the upward-opening parts and one on the downward-opening part, or vice versa.\n\nWait, but in our solution, we have three x-coordinates, which suggests three intersection points. But wait, let me check if that's correct.\n\nWait, when I solved Case 1, I got two solutions: one at x \u22485.415 and another at x\u2248-0.415. Then, in Case 2, I got x=3.5. So, that's three solutions in total.\n\nBut let me think: is it possible that in Case 2, the equation could have more solutions? Because when I solved Case 2, the quadratic had a discriminant of zero, which gave only one solution.\n\nSo, that seems correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I should graph these functions mentally. The absolute value function is a V-shape, and the line is descending. So, maybe they intersect three times: once on the left V, once on the right V, and once in the middle.\n\nWait, but when I factored, I considered the expression inside the absolute value as positive for x \u22641 and x \u22655, and negative in between. So, the graph of y = |x\u00b2 - 6x +5| would be the original parabola above the x-axis for x \u22641 and x \u22655, and the reflection of the parabola between x=1 and x=5.\n\nSo, the line y = (29/4) - x is a straight line that might intersect the left side, the middle, and the right side of the absolute value graph.\n\nThus, three intersection points, hence three solutions.\n\nWait, but when I solved Case 1, I got two solutions, and Case 2 gave me one solution, so that's three in total.\n\nBut wait, let me check if the line could intersect more than once in either Case 1 or Case 2.\n\nIn Case 1, when I solved the quadratic, I got two solutions, but both were valid in their respective domains. So, that's two points.\n\nIn Case 2, the quadratic had a double root, so only one solution, at x=3.5.\n\nSo, total three solutions.\n\nWait, but let me check if in Case 1, perhaps the quadratic could have more than two solutions? No, because a quadratic can have at most two real roots.\n\nSo, yes, three solutions in total.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when I solved Case 1, I had two solutions, one in x \u22641 and one in x \u22655. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, the x-coordinates are:\n\n1. x = (5 + \u221a34)/2 \u22485.415\n\n2. x = (5 - \u221a34)/2 \u2248-0.415\n\n3. x = 7/2 = 3.5\n\nSo, to find the sum of these x-coordinates, I can add them up.\n\nLet me compute:\n\nSum = [(5 + \u221a34)/2] + [(5 - \u221a34)/2] + [7/2]\n\nSimplify the first two terms:\n\n[(5 + \u221a34) + (5 - \u221a34)] / 2 = (10)/2 = 5\n\nSo, sum = 5 + 7/2 = 5 + 3.5 = 8.5\n\nBut 8.5 is 17/2.\n\nWait, let me compute it exactly:\n\nSum = [(5 + \u221a34)/2 + (5 - \u221a34)/2] + 7/2\n\n= [ (5 + \u221a34 + 5 - \u221a34)/2 ] + 7/2\n\n= [10/2] + 7/2\n\n= 5 + 3.5\n\n= 8.5, which is 17/2.\n\nAlternatively, in fractional terms:\n\n10/2 is 5, which is 10/2, so 10/2 + 7/2 = 17/2.\n\nSo, the sum of the x-coordinates is 17/2.\n\nWait, but let me check if I added correctly.\n\nYes, because:\n\n(5 + \u221a34)/2 + (5 - \u221a34)/2 = (5 + \u221a34 +5 - \u221a34)/2 = 10/2 =5\n\nThen, adding 7/2: 5 + 7/2 = 10/2 +7/2=17/2.\n\nSo, 17/2 is the sum.\n\nWait, but let me just make sure that all three solutions are valid. Because sometimes when dealing with quadratics, you can get extraneous solutions, but in this case, all three solutions checked out when I plugged them back in.\n\nSo, the sum is 17/2.\n\nWait, but I just want to make sure I didn't miss any solutions. Let me think again.\n\nWe had three solutions: two from Case 1 and one from Case 2. So, three x-coordinates.\n\nAdding them together: 5 + 7/2 = 17/2.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe sum of the x-coordinates is \\boxed{\\dfrac{17}{2}}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the system of equations \\( y = |x^2 - 6x + 5| \\) and \\( y = \\frac{29}{4} - x \\), we first factor the quadratic expression inside the absolute value:\n\n\\[ x^2 - 6x + 5 = (x - 1)(x - 5) \\]\n\nThis expression is positive for \\( x \\leq 1 \\) and \\( x \\geq 5 \\), and negative for \\( 1 < x < 5 \\).
