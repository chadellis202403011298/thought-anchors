Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I need to evaluate the logarithm log base sqrt(6) of 216 times sqrt(6). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that logarithms can be tricky, but maybe I can use some logarithm properties to simplify this.\n\nFirst, let me write down the problem to make it clearer: log_{\u221a6}(216\u221a6). So, the base is the square root of 6, and the argument is 216 times the square root of 6. I need to find the exponent that I would raise sqrt(6) to in order to get 216\u221a6.\n\nI recall that logarithms and exponents are inverses, so maybe I can express both the base and the argument in terms of powers of 6. That might make it easier to compare the exponents. Let's try that.\n\nThe base is sqrt(6), which is the same as 6^(1/2). Okay, that's straightforward. Now, the argument is 216\u221a6. Let me see if I can express 216 as a power of 6. I know that 6^3 is 216 because 6*6=36, and 36*6=216. So, 6^3 = 216. Great, so 216 is 6^3.\n\nNow, the argument is 216\u221a6, which is 6^3 times 6^(1/2). Since when you multiply terms with the same base, you add the exponents, I can write this as 6^(3 + 1/2). Let me compute that exponent: 3 + 1/2 is the same as 3.5 or 7/2. So, 6^(7/2).\n\nSo now, the logarithm becomes log_{6^(1/2)}(6^(7/2)). Hmm, okay. I remember that log_{a^b}(a^c) is equal to c/b. Let me verify that. If I have log_{a^b}(a^c), that should be equal to (c)/(b) because (a^b) raised to the power of (c/b) would give a^c. Yes, that makes sense.\n\nApplying that here, the base is 6^(1/2) and the argument is 6^(7/2). So, using the property, the logarithm would be (7/2) divided by (1/2). Let me compute that: (7/2) / (1/2) is the same as (7/2) multiplied by (2/1), which is 7. So, the result is 7.\n\nWait, let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, if I take sqrt(6) raised to the 7th power, does that equal 216\u221a6? Let's see: sqrt(6)^7 is (6^(1/2))^7, which is 6^(7/2). And 6^(7/2) is the same as 6^(3 + 1/2) which is 6^3 times 6^(1/2), which is 216 times sqrt(6). Yep, that's exactly the argument we started with. So, that checks out.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the change of base formula to verify. The change of base formula says that log_b(a) = log_c(a) / log_c(b) for any positive c not equal to 1. Let's choose base 6 for simplicity. So, log_{sqrt(6)}(216\u221a6) = log_6(216\u221a6) / log_6(sqrt(6)).\n\nWe already know that 216 is 6^3 and sqrt(6) is 6^(1/2), so 216\u221a6 is 6^(3 + 1/2) = 6^(7/2). Therefore, log_6(6^(7/2)) is 7/2. And log_6(sqrt(6)) is log_6(6^(1/2)) which is 1/2. So, dividing 7/2 by 1/2 gives (7/2)*(2/1) = 7. So, that confirms it again.\n\nI think I'm confident now that the answer is 7. It seems consistent across different methods, so I don't think I made any mistakes here.\n</think>\n\nTo evaluate the logarithm \\(\\log_{\\sqrt{6}} (216\\sqrt{6})\\), we can express both the base and the argument in terms of powers of 6.\n\n1. **Express the base as a power of 6**:\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{6} = 6^{1/2}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Express the argument as a power of 6**:\n   - \\(216 = 6^3\\)\n   - \\(\\sqrt{6} = 6^{1/2}\\)\n   - Therefore, \\(216\\sqrt{6} = 6^3 \\times 6^{1/2} = 6^{3 + 1/2} = 6^{7/2}\\)\n\n3. **Rewrite the logarithm**:\n   \\[\n   \\log_{6^{1/2}} (6^{7/2})\n   \\]\n\n4. **Apply the logarithm power rule**:\n   \\[\n   \\log_{a^b}(a^c) = \\frac{c}{b}\n   \\]\n   Here, \\(a = 6\\), \\(b = 1/2\\), and \\(c = 7/2\\), so:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{7/2}{1/2} = 7\n   \\]\n\n**Answer**: \\(\\boxed{7}\\)",
