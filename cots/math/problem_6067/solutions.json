Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I need to simplify the expression 15 multiplied by 7/10 multiplied by 1/9. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this step by step. \n\nFirst, I remember that when you're multiplying fractions, you can multiply the numerators together and the denominators together. But here, we also have a whole number, 15, being multiplied by these fractions. I think the best way to handle this is to convert the whole number into a fraction so that everything is in fraction form, which might make it easier to cancel out terms and simplify.\n\nSo, 15 can be written as 15/1. That way, the problem becomes (15/1) multiplied by (7/10) multiplied by (1/9). Now, I can multiply all the numerators together and all the denominators together.\n\nLet me write that out: (15 * 7 * 1) divided by (1 * 10 * 9). Calculating the numerator first, 15 times 7 is... let me see, 15*7 is 105. Then, 105 times 1 is still 105. So the numerator is 105.\n\nNow the denominator: 1 times 10 is 10, and 10 times 9 is 90. So the denominator is 90. So now the expression is 105/90.\n\nWait, 105 over 90 can be simplified further. Both numbers are divisible by 15, I think. Let me check: 15 times 7 is 105, and 15 times 6 is 90. So, if I divide both numerator and denominator by 15, I get 7/6. So, 105 divided by 15 is 7, and 90 divided by 15 is 6. So the simplified fraction is 7/6.\n\nAlternatively, I could have simplified before multiplying to make the calculations easier. Let me try that approach too, just to confirm.\n\nStarting with 15 * (7/10) * (1/9). I can look for common factors between the numerators and denominators. 15 and 9 have a common factor of 3. So, I can divide 15 by 3 to get 5, and 9 by 3 to get 3. So now, the expression becomes 5 * (7/10) * (1/3).\n\nNext, looking at 5 and 10, they have a common factor of 5. So I can divide 5 by 5 to get 1, and 10 by 5 to get 2. Now the expression is 1 * (7/2) * (1/3).\n\nMultiplying these together: 1 times 7 is 7, times 1 is still 7. In the denominator, 2 times 3 is 6. So again, I get 7/6.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. So, starting with 15 * 7/10 * 1/9.\n\nFirst method: Multiply all numerators and denominators. 15*7*1=105, 1*10*9=90. 105/90 simplifies by dividing numerator and denominator by 15 to get 7/6. That seems correct.\n\nSecond method: Simplify before multiplying. 15 and 9 share 3, so 15 becomes 5, 9 becomes 3. Then 5 and 10 share 5, so 5 becomes 1, 10 becomes 2. Then multiply 1*7*1=7, and denominators 2*3=6, so 7/6. Yep, same result.\n\nAlternatively, I could have canceled out the 15 and 9 first. 15 divided by 3 is 5, and 9 divided by 3 is 3, so that's where the 5 comes from. Then 5 and 10 share a 5, so that's where the 1 comes from. So, the process seems consistent.\n\nI think I can also check this by converting the fractions to decimals to see if it makes sense. Let's see:\n\n15 multiplied by 7/10 is 15 * 0.7, which is 10.5. Then, 10.5 multiplied by 1/9 is 10.5 divided by 9, which is approximately 1.166666..., which is the decimal equivalent of 7/6. Since 7 divided by 6 is about 1.166666..., that checks out.\n\nSo, whether I do it by simplifying first, multiplying all together and then simplifying, or converting to decimals, I end up with the same result: 7/6.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. Both methods led me to the same simplified fraction, and the decimal check also matches. So, I'm confident that the simplified form of 15 * 7/10 * 1/9 is 7/6.\n</think>\n\nTo simplify \\(15 \\cdot \\frac{7}{10} \\cdot \\frac{1}{9}\\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Express all terms as fractions**: Convert 15 to \\(\\frac{15}{1}\\).
