If the roll is a prime number, then she wins that amount of dollars (so that, for example, if she rolls 3, then she wins 3 dollars).  If the roll is composite, she wins nothing. Otherwise, she loses 3 dollars. What is the expected value of her winnings on one die toss? Express your answer as a dollar value to the nearest cent. Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the expected value of Monica's winnings when she tosses a fair 6-sided die. Hmm, let's start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the die is fair, so each face (1 through 6) has an equal probability of 1/6. Now, the problem says that if Monica rolls a prime number, she wins that amount in dollars. If she rolls a composite number, she wins nothing. Otherwise, she loses 3 dollars. Wait, the wording here is a bit confusing. Let me parse it again.\n\nSo, if the roll is a prime number, she wins that amount. For example, rolling a 3 means she wins $3. If it's composite, she wins nothing. Otherwise, she loses $3. Hmm, so the \"otherwise\" must refer to numbers that are neither prime nor composite. But wait, on a die, the numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Let me list which are prime, composite, and neither.\n\nPrime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. So, on a die, the primes are 2, 3, and 5. Composite numbers are numbers greater than 1 that are not prime, so on a die, those would be 4 and 6. Now, the number 1 is neither prime nor composite. So, if she rolls a 1, that's the \"otherwise\" case, and she loses $3.\n\nLet me summarize:\n\n- Prime numbers: 2, 3, 5. She wins $2, $3, $5 respectively.\n- Composite numbers: 4, 6. She wins $0.\n- Neither prime nor composite: 1. She loses $3.\n\nSo, the possible outcomes and their payouts are:\n\n1: -$3\n\n2: +$2\n\n3: +$3\n\n4: $0\n\n5: +$5\n\n6: $0\n\nNow, to find the expected value, I need to calculate the sum of each outcome multiplied by its probability.\n\nFirst, let's list each outcome, its payout, and the probability.\n\n1: Payout = -$3, Probability = 1/6\n\n2: Payout = +$2, Probability = 1/6\n\n3: Payout = +$3, Probability = 1/6\n\n4: Payout = $0, Probability = 1/6\n\n5: Payout = +$5, Probability = 1/6\n\n6: Payout = $0, Probability = 1/6\n\nSo, the expected value (E) is calculated as:\n\nE = (Probability of 1 * Payout for 1) + (Probability of 2 * Payout for 2) + ... + (Probability of 6 * Payout for 6)\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nE = (1/6)*(-3) + (1/6)*(2) + (1/6)*(3) + (1/6)*(0) + (1/6)*(5) + (1/6)*(0)\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\n(1/6)*(-3) = -3/6 = -0.5\n\n(1/6)*(2) = 2/6 \u2248 0.3333\n\n(1/6)*(3) = 3/6 = 0.5\n\n(1/6)*(0) = 0\n\n(1/6)*(5) = 5/6 \u2248 0.8333\n\n(1/6)*(0) = 0\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\n-0.5 + 0.3333 + 0.5 + 0 + 0.8333 + 0\n\nLet me compute step by step:\n\nStart with -0.5.\n\nAdd 0.3333: -0.5 + 0.3333 = -0.1667\n\nAdd 0.5: -0.1667 + 0.5 = 0.3333\n\nAdd 0: still 0.3333\n\nAdd 0.8333: 0.3333 + 0.8333 = 1.1666\n\nAdd 0: still 1.1666\n\nSo, the expected value is approximately $1.1666.\n\nBut let me verify my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute the sum as fractions to be more precise.\n\nLet me express each payout as fractions:\n\n-3, 2, 3, 0, 5, 0.\n\nSo, adding them up: (-3) + 2 + 3 + 0 + 5 + 0 = (-3 + 2) + (3 + 5) = (-1) + 8 = 7.\n\nThen, the sum of payouts is 7. Since each outcome has probability 1/6, the expected value is (7) * (1/6) = 7/6.\n\n7 divided by 6 is approximately 1.166666..., which is $1.17 when rounded to the nearest cent.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that sum of payouts. Let me add each payout:\n\n-3 (for 1) + 2 (for 2) + 3 (for 3) + 0 (for 4) + 5 (for 5) + 0 (for 6).\n\nSo, -3 + 2 = -1; -1 + 3 = 2; 2 + 0 = 2; 2 + 5 = 7; 7 + 0 = 7. Yes, that's correct. So, 7/6 is indeed approximately 1.166666...\n\nSo, the expected value is $1.17 when rounded to the nearest cent.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't misclassify any numbers as prime or composite. So, 2 is prime, 3 is prime, 5 is prime. 4 and 6 are composite. 1 is neither. That seems correct.\n\nSo, the payouts are correct as per the problem statement.\n\nTherefore, the expected value is $1.17.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe expected value of her winnings is \\boxed{\\$1.17}.\n</think>\n\nMonica tosses a fair 6-sided die.
