Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the point where the line passing through the points (3,4,1) and (5,1,6) intersects the xy-plane. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the xy-plane is where z = 0. So, any point on the xy-plane will have its z-coordinate equal to zero. Therefore, the point where the line intersects the xy-plane must satisfy z = 0. So, my goal is to find the point (x, y, 0) that lies on the line passing through (3,4,1) and (5,1,6).\n\nTo find this point, I think I should parametrize the line. Parametrizing a line in 3D space usually involves using a parameter, say t, and expressing the line in terms of this parameter. The general form is:\n\nr(t) = r0 + t * v\n\nwhere r0 is a point on the line and v is the direction vector of the line.\n\nSo, let me first find the direction vector of the line. The direction vector can be found by subtracting the coordinates of the two given points. The two points are (3,4,1) and (5,1,6). So, subtracting the first from the second:\n\nv = (5 - 3, 1 - 4, 6 - 1) = (2, -3, 5)\n\nSo, the direction vector is (2, -3, 5). Now, I can choose either of the two points as r0. Let me choose (3,4,1) as r0. So, the parametric equations for the line will be:\n\nx = 3 + 2t\ny = 4 - 3t\nz = 1 + 5t\n\nSo, now I have the parametric equations:\n\nx = 3 + 2t\ny = 4 - 3t\nz = 1 + 5t\n\nNow, since we're looking for the point where this line intersects the xy-plane, we need to find the value of t where z = 0. So, let's set z = 0 and solve for t.\n\nFrom the z equation:\n\n1 + 5t = 0\n\nSubtract 1 from both sides:\n\n5t = -1\n\nDivide both sides by 5:\n\nt = -1/5\n\nSo, t is -1/5. Now, with this value of t, I can plug it back into the equations for x and y to find the corresponding x and y coordinates.\n\nLet's compute x:\n\nx = 3 + 2*(-1/5) = 3 - 2/5\n\nHmm, 3 is equal to 15/5, so:\n\n15/5 - 2/5 = 13/5\n\nSo, x = 13/5.\n\nNow, let's compute y:\n\ny = 4 - 3*(-1/5) = 4 + 3/5\n\n4 is 20/5, so:\n\n20/5 + 3/5 = 23/5\n\nSo, y = 23/5.\n\nTherefore, the point where the line intersects the xy-plane is (13/5, 23/5, 0).\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, direction vector: from (3,4,1) to (5,1,6), so 5-3=2, 1-4=-3, 6-1=5. That looks correct.\n\nParametric equations: x=3+2t, y=4-3t, z=1+5t. Correct.\n\nSetting z=0: 1+5t=0 \u2192 t=-1/5. Correct.\n\nCalculating x: 3 + 2*(-1/5) = 3 - 2/5. 3 is 15/5, so 15/5 - 2/5=13/5. Correct.\n\nCalculating y: 4 -3*(-1/5)=4 + 3/5. 4 is 20/5, so 20/5 +3/5=23/5. Correct.\n\nSo, the point is (13/5, 23/5, 0). Let me write that as fractions to be precise: 13/5 is 2 and 3/5, 23/5 is 4 and 3/5, so the point is (2.6, 4.6, 0) in decimal form, but since the problem uses fractions, I should present it as fractions.\n\nWait, just to be thorough, maybe I should check if the point (13/5, 23/5, 0) actually lies on both the line and the xy-plane.\n\nFirst, checking if it's on the line: plug t=-1/5 into parametric equations.\n\nx=3 + 2*(-1/5)=3 - 2/5=13/5, correct.\n\ny=4 -3*(-1/5)=4 + 3/5=23/5, correct.\n\nz=1 +5*(-1/5)=1 -1=0, correct.\n\nAnd it's on the xy-plane since z=0. So, yes, that's correct.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. So, the point is (13/5, 23/5, 0).\n</think>\n\nThe line passing through the points (3,4,1) and (5,1,6) intersects the xy-plane at the point (13/5, 23/5, 0).\n\nStep-by-Step Explanation:\n\n1. **Identify the Points and Plane:**\n   - The given points are A(3,4,1) and B(5,1,6).\n   - The xy-plane is defined by z = 0.\n\n2. **Find the Direction Vector:**\n   - Subtract coordinates of A from B: \n     - Direction vector v = (5-3, 1-4, 6-1) = (2, -3, 5).\n\n3. **Parametrize the Line:**\n   - Using point A as the base point, the parametric equations are:\n     - x = 3 + 2t\n     - y = 4 - 3t\n     - z = 1 + 5t\n\n4. **Determine Where z = 0:**\n   - Set z = 0: 1 + 5t = 0 \u21d2 t = -1/5.\n\n5. **Find x and y at t = -1/5:**\n   - x = 3 + 2*(-1/5) = 13/5\n   - y = 4 - 3*(-1/5) = 23/5\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - The intersection point is (13/5, 23/5, 0).\n\n$\\boxed{\\left( \\dfrac{13}{5}, \\dfrac{23}{5}, 0 \\right)}$",
