Determine the value of $S_7$.\n Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this math problem here. It says that x is a real number such that x plus 1/x equals 3. Then, they define S_m as x^m plus 1/x^m, and they want me to find S_7. Hmm, interesting. I remember from algebra that when you have expressions like x + 1/x, there are some patterns or recursions that can help you find higher powers. Maybe I can find a recursive formula for S_m in terms of S_{m-1} or something like that.\n\nFirst, let me write down what I know. The given equation is x + 1/x = 3. Let me denote this as S_1 = 3 because S_m is x^m + 1/x^m. So S_1 = 3.\n\nNow, I need to find S_7. I think I can compute S_2, S_3, all the way up to S_7 using some kind of recursive relation. How do I find S_2? Maybe by squaring both sides of the equation S_1 = 3.\n\nLet me try that. If I square both sides, I get (x + 1/x)^2 = 3^2. Expanding the left side, that's x^2 + 2*(x)*(1/x) + 1/x^2, which simplifies to x^2 + 2 + 1/x^2. So, S_2 + 2 = 9, since 3 squared is 9. Therefore, S_2 = 9 - 2 = 7. Okay, so S_2 is 7.\n\nNow, how do I get S_3? Maybe I can multiply S_1 and S_2. Let's see: (x + 1/x)(x^2 + 1/x^2) = x^3 + x*(1/x^2) + (1/x)*x^2 + 1/x^3. Simplifying each term: x^3 + 1/x + x + 1/x^3. Hmm, that's x^3 + 1/x^3 + (x + 1/x). So, that's S_3 + S_1. Therefore, S_3 + S_1 = S_1 * S_2.\n\nPlugging in the numbers, S_3 + 3 = 3*7. So, S_3 + 3 = 21, which means S_3 = 21 - 3 = 18. So, S_3 is 18.\n\nMoving on to S_4. Maybe I can use a similar approach. Let me square S_2. So, (x^2 + 1/x^2)^2 = x^4 + 2 + 1/x^4. That means S_4 + 2 = (S_2)^2, which is 7^2 = 49. So, S_4 = 49 - 2 = 47. So, S_4 is 47.\n\nWait, is there a general formula here? It seems like each S_m can be expressed in terms of previous S terms. Let me check if there's a recurrence relation. From what I saw earlier, when I multiplied S_1 and S_2, I got S_3 + S_1. So, maybe S_{m} = S_{m-1} * S_1 - S_{m-2}? Let me test this.\n\nFor S_3, according to this, S_3 = S_2 * S_1 - S_1. Wait, no, that would be S_3 = S_2 * S_1 - S_1, which would be 7*3 - 3 = 21 - 3 = 18, which matches. Similarly, S_4 can be found as S_3 * S_1 - S_2, which would be 18*3 - 7 = 54 - 7 = 47, which also matches. So, yes, the recurrence seems to hold: S_m = S_{m-1} * S_1 - S_{m-2}.\n\nGreat, so I can use this recurrence relation to compute S_5, S_6, and S_7. Let me do that step by step.\n\nFirst, S_4 is 47. So, S_5 = S_4 * S_1 - S_3 = 47*3 - 18. Let's compute that: 47*3 is 141, minus 18 is 123. So, S_5 = 123.\n\nNext, S_6 = S_5 * S_1 - S_4 = 123*3 - 47. 123*3 is 369, minus 47 is 322. So, S_6 = 322.\n\nFinally, S_7 = S_6 * S_1 - S_5 = 322*3 - 123. Let me calculate that: 322*3 is 966, minus 123 is 843. So, S_7 = 843.\n\nWait a second, let me verify if this recurrence is correct for all m. I think it's a standard result for these kinds of expressions. Let me see: If we have S_m = x^m + 1/x^m, then S_{m} = (x + 1/x)(x^{m-1} + 1/x^{m-1}) - (x^{m-2} + 1/x^{m-2}). So, S_m = S_1 * S_{m-1} - S_{m-2}. Yes, that's correct. So, the recurrence holds for all m >= 3.\n\nTherefore, using this, I can be confident that my calculations for S_3 through S_7 are correct. So, S_7 is 843.\n\nI don't think I made any calculation errors, but let me double-check the arithmetic:\n\n- S_1 = 3\n\n- S_2 = 7\n\n- S_3 = 3*7 - 3 = 21 - 3 = 18\n\n- S_4 = 18*3 - 7 = 54 - 7 = 47\n\n- S_5 = 47*3 - 18 = 141 - 18 = 123\n\n- S_6 = 123*3 - 47 = 369 - 47 = 322\n\n- S_7 = 322*3 - 123 = 966 - 123 = 843\n\nYes, all steps check out. So, the final answer should be 843.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of \\( S_7 \\) is \\boxed{843}.\n</think>\n\nGiven that \\( x \\) is a real number such that \\( x + \\frac{1}{x} = 3 \\), we need to determine the value of \\( S_7 \\) where \\( S_m = x^m + \\frac{1}{x^m} \\).\n\nFirst, we note that \\( S_1 = 3 \\).\n\nTo find \\( S_2 \\), we square both sides of the given equation:\n\\[\n\\left( x + \\frac{1}{x} \\right)^2 = 3^2\n\\]\nExpanding the left side, we get:\n\\[\nx^2 + 2 + \\frac{1}{x^2} = 9\n\\]\nThus,\n\\[\nS_2 + 2 = 9 \\implies S_2 = 7\n\\]\n\nNext, we use the recurrence relation \\( S_m = S_{m-1} \\cdot S_1 - S_{m-2} \\) to find higher powers. \n\nFor \\( S_3 \\):\n\\[\nS_3 = S_2 \\cdot S_1 - S_1 = 7 \\cdot 3 - 3 = 21 - 3 = 18\n\\]\n\nFor \\( S_4 \\):\n\\[\nS_4 = S_3 \\cdot S_1 - S_2 = 18 \\cdot 3 - 7 = 54 - 7 = 47\n\\]\n\nFor \\( S_5 \\):\n\\[\nS_5 = S_4 \\cdot S_1 - S_3 = 47 \\cdot 3 - 18 = 141 - 18 = 123\n\\]\n\nFor \\( S_6 \\):\n\\[\nS_6 = S_5 \\cdot S_1 - S_4 = 123 \\cdot 3 - 47 = 369 - 47 = 322\n\\]\n\nFinally, for \\( S_7 \\):\n\\[\nS_7 = S_6 \\cdot S_1 - S_5 = 322 \\cdot 3 - 123 = 966 - 123 = 843\n\\]\n\nThus, the value of \\( S_7 \\) is \\(\\boxed{843}\\).",
