Problem: In trapezoid $ABCD$, sides $\\overline{AB}$ and $\\overline{CD}$ are parallel, $\\angle A = 2\\angle D$, and $\\angle C = 3\\angle B$.  Find $\\angle A$. Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this trapezoid problem to solve, and I need to find angle A. Let me try to break it down step by step. First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly.\n\nWe have a trapezoid ABCD, where sides AB and CD are parallel. So, AB is one of the bases, and CD is the other base. Now, the problem states that angle A is twice angle D, so angle A = 2 * angle D. Also, angle C is three times angle B, so angle C = 3 * angle B. The goal is to find the measure of angle A.\n\nAlright, let me recall some properties of trapezoids. In a trapezoid, the sum of the angles on the same side is 180 degrees because the two bases are parallel. So, that means angle A + angle D = 180 degrees, and angle B + angle C = 180 degrees. This is because consecutive angles between the non-parallel sides (the legs) are supplementary when the bases are parallel.\n\nWait, let me make sure I got that right. So, in a trapezoid, each pair of adjacent angles on the same base adds up to 180 degrees. So, for example, angle A and angle D are on the same base AD, so they should add up to 180 degrees. Similarly, angle B and angle C are on the same base BC, so they should also add up to 180 degrees. That makes sense because the sides AB and CD are parallel, so the consecutive angles between the legs should be supplementary.\n\nSo, let me write down the equations based on this.\n\nFirst, angle A + angle D = 180 degrees. But the problem says angle A = 2 * angle D. So, substituting that into the first equation, we get 2 * angle D + angle D = 180 degrees. That simplifies to 3 * angle D = 180 degrees, so angle D = 60 degrees. Then, angle A would be 2 * 60 = 120 degrees. Hmm, that seems straightforward, but wait, the problem also mentions angle C and angle B. So, maybe I need to consider that as well.\n\nWait, maybe I'm oversimplifying. Let me check. So, if I just take angle A + angle D = 180, and angle A = 2 angle D, then angle D = 60 and angle A = 120. But then, what about angle B and angle C? The problem also states that angle C = 3 angle B. So, using the same logic, angle B + angle C = 180 degrees. Substituting angle C = 3 angle B, we get angle B + 3 angle B = 4 angle B = 180, so angle B = 45 degrees, and angle C = 135 degrees.\n\nWait, but in a trapezoid, the sum of all four angles should be 360 degrees, right? Let me check that. So, angle A + angle D + angle B + angle C = 120 + 60 + 45 + 135 = 360 degrees. Yep, that adds up correctly. So, maybe that's all there is to it, and angle A is 120 degrees.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure that this makes sense in the context of a trapezoid. So, in trapezoid ABCD, AB is parallel to CD. Let me try to visualize it. So, if AB is the top base and CD is the bottom base, then angle A is at the bottom left, angle D is at the bottom right, angle B is at the top right, and angle C is at the top left. Wait, no, actually, in a trapezoid, the vertices are usually labeled in order, so ABCD would have AB and CD as the two bases, with AD and BC as the legs. So, angle A is at the bottom left, angle B is at the top left, angle C is at the top right, and angle D is at the bottom right.\n\nWait, that might be a bit confusing. Let me try to sketch it mentally. So, imagine a trapezoid with AB as the top base, CD as the bottom base, and AD and BC as the legs. So, angle A is at the bottom left corner, angle D is at the bottom right, angle B is at the top left, and angle C is at the top right. So, angle A and angle D are on the same leg AD, and angle B and angle C are on the same leg BC.\n\nWait, but in that case, the angles at the bases should be supplementary. So, angle A and angle D are on the same base CD, so they should add up to 180 degrees, and angle B and angle C are on the same base AB, so they should add up to 180 degrees as well. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, in a trapezoid, the two angles adjacent to each base should add up to 180 degrees. So, for base AB, the angles at A and B should add up to 180, and for base CD, the angles at C and D should add up to 180. Wait, that seems conflicting with what I thought before.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify this. In a trapezoid, each pair of angles on the same side (i.e., adjacent to the same leg) are supplementary. So, if AB and CD are the two bases, then angle A and angle D are on the same leg AD, so they should add up to 180 degrees. Similarly, angle B and angle C are on the same leg BC, so they should also add up to 180 degrees.\n\nWait, but that contradicts what I thought earlier, where I considered angle A and angle D as being on the same base. Hmm, maybe I got the sides mixed up. Let me try to define the trapezoid more precisely.\n\nLet me label the trapezoid as follows: points A, B, C, D in order, so that AB is the top base, BC is the right leg, CD is the bottom base, and DA is the left leg. So, in this case, angle A is at the bottom left, angle B is at the top left, angle C is at the top right, and angle D is at the bottom right.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Wait, if it's a trapezoid, then the order of the points should be such that AB and CD are the two bases, so AB is connected to BC, which connects to CD, which connects to DA, which connects back to AB. So, in that case, angle A is at the bottom left, angle B is at the top left, angle C is at the top right, and angle D is at the bottom right.\n\nWait, but then angle A and angle D are on the same base CD, right? Because CD is the lower base, so angle D is at the end of CD, and angle A is at the end of DA, which connects to CD. Hmm, maybe I'm complicating this.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the sides. So, in trapezoid ABCD, AB is parallel to CD. So, sides AB and CD are the two bases. Then, sides AD and BC are the legs. So, angle A is at vertex A, which is connected to sides AB and AD. Similarly, angle D is at vertex D, connected to sides CD and DA. So, angle A and angle D are on the same leg AD. Therefore, they should be supplementary because they are adjacent to the same leg and the bases are parallel. So, angle A + angle D = 180 degrees.\n\nSimilarly, angle B is at vertex B, connected to sides AB and BC, and angle C is at vertex C, connected to sides BC and CD. So, angle B and angle C are on the same leg BC, so they should also be supplementary: angle B + angle C = 180 degrees.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, in this setup, angle A and angle D are on leg AD, and angle B and angle C are on leg BC. So, each pair of angles on the same leg adds up to 180 degrees because the bases are parallel.\n\nSo, given that, let's go back to the problem. The problem states that angle A = 2 angle D, and angle C = 3 angle B.\n\nSo, from angle A + angle D = 180, and angle A = 2 angle D, we can write:\n\n2 angle D + angle D = 180\n3 angle D = 180\nangle D = 60 degrees\nangle A = 2 * 60 = 120 degrees\n\nSimilarly, for the other pair of angles, angle B + angle C = 180, and angle C = 3 angle B, so:\n\nangle B + 3 angle B = 180\n4 angle B = 180\nangle B = 45 degrees\nangle C = 3 * 45 = 135 degrees\n\nWait, so angle A is 120 degrees. That seems straightforward, but let me check if this is consistent with the trapezoid's properties.\n\nWait, but I feel like I'm missing something because the problem mentions angle C and angle B, so maybe I need to ensure that the trapezoid is convex and that all angles are less than 180 degrees, which they are here: 120, 60, 135, and 45 degrees. So, that seems okay.\n\nBut wait, maybe I should also consider the possibility of the trapezoid being isosceles, but the problem doesn't specify that, so I can't assume that. In an isosceles trapezoid, the base angles are equal, but here, angle A is twice angle D, so it's not isosceles.\n\nWait, perhaps I should double-check the equations. So, angle A + angle D = 180, and angle A = 2 angle D. So, substituting, 2D + D = 180, so 3D = 180, D = 60, A = 120. Similarly, angle B + angle C = 180, angle C = 3 angle B, so 4B = 180, B = 45, C = 135. All angles add up to 360, which is correct for a quadrilateral.\n\nWait, so maybe that's all there is to it. So, angle A is 120 degrees. Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't overlook any other constraints. For example, in a trapezoid, the sum of the angles adjacent to each base is 180 degrees. So, if AB is the top base, then angles at A and B are on the left side, and they should add up to 180 degrees. Wait, but in my earlier calculation, angle A is 120 and angle B is 45, so 120 + 45 = 165, which is not 180. Wait, that's a problem.\n\nWait, hold on, that can't be right. So, maybe I made a mistake in how I associated the angles with the sides. Let me go back.\n\nWait, perhaps I got the sides wrong. If AB and CD are the bases, then the angles at A and B are on the same side, which is AB, so they should add up to 180 degrees. Similarly, angles at C and D are on the same side, CD, so they should add up to 180 degrees.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, if AB is the top base, then angles at A and B are on the left and right sides of AB, so they should be supplementary. Similarly, angles at C and D are on the left and right sides of CD, so they should add up to 180 degrees as well.\n\nWait, so that means angle A + angle B = 180, and angle C + angle D = 180.\n\nBut the problem says angle A = 2 angle D, and angle C = 3 angle B.\n\nWait, so let's write down the equations again with this correction.\n\nFirst, angle A + angle B = 180 degrees.\n\nSecond, angle C + angle D = 180 degrees.\n\nBut the problem gives angle A = 2 angle D, and angle C = 3 angle B.\n\nSo, let me assign variables. Let me let angle D = x degrees. Then, angle A = 2x degrees.\n\nSimilarly, let me let angle B = y degrees. Then, angle C = 3y degrees.\n\nNow, from angle A + angle B = 180, we have 2x + y = 180.\n\nFrom angle C + angle D = 180, we have 3y + x = 180.\n\nSo, now we have two equations:\n\n1) 2x + y = 180\n\n2) x + 3y = 180\n\nWe can solve this system of equations to find x and y.\n\nLet me write them again:\n\n2x + y = 180 ...(1)\n\nx + 3y = 180 ...(2)\n\nLet me solve equation (1) for y: y = 180 - 2x.\n\nNow, substitute this into equation (2):\n\nx + 3*(180 - 2x) = 180\n\nSimplify:\n\nx + 540 - 6x = 180\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n-5x + 540 = 180\n\nSubtract 540 from both sides:\n\n-5x = 180 - 540\n\n-5x = -360\n\nDivide both sides by -5:\n\nx = (-360)/(-5) = 72 degrees.\n\nSo, angle D = x = 72 degrees.\n\nThen, angle A = 2x = 144 degrees.\n\nNow, let's find y. From equation (1): y = 180 - 2x = 180 - 2*72 = 180 - 144 = 36 degrees.\n\nSo, angle B = y = 36 degrees.\n\nThen, angle C = 3y = 3*36 = 108 degrees.\n\nLet me check if these angles add up correctly.\n\nAngle A + angle B = 144 + 36 = 180, which is correct.\n\nAngle C + angle D = 108 + 72 = 180, which is also correct.\n\nAnd the total sum of all angles is 144 + 36 + 108 + 72 = 360 degrees, which is correct for a quadrilateral.\n\nWait, so earlier I thought angle A was 120 degrees, but that was based on a wrong assumption about which angles add up to 180. It seems I mixed up which angles are supplementary.\n\nSo, the correct approach is that angle A and angle B are on the same base AB, so they add up to 180, and angle C and angle D are on the same base CD, so they add up to 180. Therefore, the correct value for angle A is 144 degrees.\n\nWait, that makes sense because in a trapezoid, the angles adjacent to each base add up to 180 degrees. So, if AB is the top base, then angles at A (bottom left) and B (top left) are on the same side, so they add up to 180. Similarly, angles at C (top right) and D (bottom right) are on the same side, so they add up to 180.\n\nSo, with that correction, angle A is 144 degrees, angle D is 72 degrees, angle B is 36 degrees, and angle C is 108 degrees.\n\nWait, let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me go through the equations again.\n\nWe had:\n\n2x + y = 180 ...(1)\n\nx + 3y = 180 ...(2)\n\nFrom equation (1), y = 180 - 2x.\n\nSubstitute into equation (2):\n\nx + 3*(180 - 2x) = 180\n\nx + 540 - 6x = 180\n\n-5x + 540 = 180\n\n-5x = 180 - 540\n\n-5x = -360\n\nx = (-360)/(-5) = 72.\n\nSo, x = 72, which is angle D.\n\nThen, y = 180 - 2x = 180 - 144 = 36, which is angle B.\n\nSo, angle A = 2x = 144, angle C = 3y = 108.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nI think I made a mistake earlier by incorrectly associating which angles add up to 180. Initially, I thought angle A and D added to 180, but that's not correct because angle A and D are on different sides. Instead, it's angle A and B that add to 180, and angle C and D that add to 180.\n\nSo, the correct measure of angle A is 144 degrees.\n\nWait, but let me just visualize the trapezoid again to make sure. If angle A is 144 degrees, that's a pretty large angle, which would make angle B = 36 degrees, a small angle. Then, angle C is 108 degrees, and angle D is 72 degrees.\n\nIf I imagine the trapezoid, with AB as the top base, then at point A (bottom left), the angle is 144 degrees, which would mean that the leg AD is slanting inwards quite sharply. At point B (top left), the angle is 36 degrees, which is a small angle, so the leg BC would be slanting outwards. Similarly, at point C (top right), angle C is 108 degrees, and at point D (bottom right), angle D is 72 degrees.\n\nWait, that seems a bit asymmetrical, but it's possible. Let me check if the sum of the angles on each side adds up to 180. So, angle A (144) + angle B (36) = 180, which is correct. Angle C (108) + angle D (72) = 180, which is also correct.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the problem was that I initially associated the wrong angles as supplementary. Once I corrected that, the solution came out correctly.\n\nSo, the final answer is angle A is 144 degrees.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe measure of angle \\( A \\) is \\boxed{144^\\circ}.\n</think>\n\nIn trapezoid \\(ABCD\\), sides \\(\\overline{AB}\\) and \\(\\overline{CD}\\) are parallel.
