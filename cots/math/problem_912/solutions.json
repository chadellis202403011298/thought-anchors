Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the slope of the line that passes through the points (-3, 5) and (2, -5). Hmm, I remember that slope is a measure of steepness, right? It's like how much the line goes up or down as you move from one point to another. I think the formula for slope involves the change in y over the change in x between the two points. Let me try to recall the exact formula.\n\nI believe the formula is m = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1), where (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are the two points. So, I should label one point as (x1, y1) and the other as (x2, y2). Let me choose (-3, 5) as (x1, y1) and (2, -5) as (x2, y2). That way, I can plug the values into the formula.\n\nWait, actually, does it matter which point I choose as (x1, y1) or (x2, y2)? I think it doesn't, because as long as I subtract them in the same order, the slope will be correct. But maybe I should double-check that thought. If I switch the points, would the slope change? Let me see: if I take (2, -5) as (x1, y1) and (-3, 5) as (x2, y2), then the numerator becomes 5 - (-5) = 10, and the denominator becomes -3 - 2 = -5. So, 10 / (-5) = -2. But if I take the original order, the numerator is -5 - 5 = -10, and the denominator is 2 - (-3) = 5. So, -10 / 5 = -2. Oh, okay, so it doesn't matter which point I choose first; the slope is the same. That's good to know.\n\nSo, going back, let me stick with the first choice: (x1, y1) = (-3, 5) and (x2, y2) = (2, -5). Now, plugging into the formula: m = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1). So, substituting the values, that becomes m = (-5 - 5) / (2 - (-3)).\n\nLet me compute the numerator first: -5 - 5. That's like subtracting 5 from -5, which gives me -10. So, the numerator is -10.\n\nNow, the denominator: 2 - (-3). Subtracting a negative is the same as adding the positive, so 2 + 3 = 5. So, the denominator is 5.\n\nPutting it all together, m = (-10) / 5. Dividing -10 by 5 gives me -2. So, the slope is -2.\n\nWait, let me just visualize this to make sure it makes sense. If I plot the points (-3,5) and (2,-5), I can imagine a line going from the left side of the graph at y=5 to the right side at y=-5. Since it's going downwards from left to right, the slope should be negative, which matches my result of -2. That seems reasonable.\n\nAnother way to think about slope is rise over run. So, if I start at (-3,5) and move to (2,-5), how much do I rise or fall, and how much do I run horizontally?\n\nThe horizontal change, or run, is from x = -3 to x = 2. So, that's 2 - (-3) = 5 units to the right. The vertical change, or rise, is from y = 5 to y = -5, which is a drop of 10 units, so that's -10. So, rise over run is -10/5 = -2. Yep, that's consistent with what I calculated earlier.\n\nI think I'm confident that the slope is -2. Let me just recap the steps to make sure I didn't skip anything. I identified the two points, chose one as (x1, y1) and the other as (x2, y2), substituted into the slope formula, computed numerator and denominator, and simplified. Then, I double-checked by visualizing the line and considering rise over run, which gave me the same answer. So, I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me try another approach. Maybe using the concept of similar triangles or something. If I draw a right triangle where the two points are vertices, the base would be the horizontal distance between them, and the height would be the vertical distance. The slope is the ratio of the height to the base.\n\nSo, the base is from x = -3 to x = 2, which is 5 units. The height is from y = 5 to y = -5, which is -10 units. So, height/base is -10/5 = -2. Same result again. That reinforces that the slope is indeed -2.\n\nI think I've covered all the bases here. I've calculated it using the formula, visualized it, and checked with another method. All methods lead to the same conclusion. So, I'm pretty sure the slope is -2.\n</think>\n\nThe slope of the line passing through the points (-3, 5) and (2, -5) is calculated using the formula \\( m = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} \\). Substituting the given points:\n\n\\( m = \\frac{-5 - 5}{2 - (-3)} = \\frac{-10}{5} = -2 \\).\n\n**Answer:** The slope is \\boxed{-2}.",
