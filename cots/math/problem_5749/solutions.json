Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I need to subtract 111.11 from 333.33 and then express the result as a decimal to the nearest hundredth. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that subtracting decimals is similar to subtracting whole numbers, but I have to be careful with the decimal points. I should line them up properly to avoid mistakes. So, let me write down the two numbers:\n\n```\n 333.33\n-111.11\n```\n\nNow, I'll subtract the numbers starting from the rightmost digit, just like I would with whole numbers. But I need to make sure I subtract each corresponding place value correctly.\n\nStarting with the hundredths place: 3 minus 1 is 2. So, the hundredths digit of the result is 2.\n\nNext, moving to the tenths place: 3 minus 1 is 2 again. So, the tenths digit is also 2.\n\nNow, the ones place: 3 minus 1 is 2. That's straightforward.\n\nMoving to the tens place: 3 minus 1 is 2. Still going smoothly.\n\nFinally, the hundreds place: 3 minus 1 is 2. Wait, that seems correct, but let me double-check because sometimes when borrowing, things can get tricky, but in this case, I don't think borrowing is needed because each digit in the minuend (333.33) is larger than or equal to the corresponding digit in the subtrahend (111.11).\n\nSo, putting it all together, the result is 222.22. \n\nWait, let me verify that. If I add 111.11 to 222.22, does it give me 333.33? Let me check:\n\n111.11 + 222.22 = 333.33. Yes, that's correct. So, the subtraction seems accurate.\n\nSince the problem asks for the result to the nearest hundredth, and 222.22 is already exact to the hundredth place, there's no rounding needed.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be 222.22.\n</think>\n\nThe result of subtracting 111.11 from 333.33 is 222.22, which is already precise to the nearest hundredth.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Align the Decimal Points:**\n   Write the numbers vertically, ensuring the decimal points are aligned.\n   ```\n     333.33\n    -111.11\n   ```\n\n2. **Subtract Each Place Value:**\n   - **Hundredths Place:** 3 - 1 = 2\n   - **Tenths Place:** 3 - 1 = 2\n   - **Ones Place:** 3 - 1 = 2\n   - **Tens Place:** 3 - 1 = 2\n   - **Hundreds Place:** 3 - 1 = 2\n\n3. **Combine the Results:**\n   The subtraction yields 222.22.\n\n4. **Verify Precision:**\n   The result is already to the nearest hundredth, so no rounding is needed.\n\n**Answer:** 222.22\n\n\\boxed{222.22}",
