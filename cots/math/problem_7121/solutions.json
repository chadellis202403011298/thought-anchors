The sphere also intersects the $yz$-plane in a circle centered at $(0,4,-7),$ with radius $r.$  Find $r.$ Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this geometry problem here about a sphere intersecting two coordinate planes, and I need to find the radius of the circle it makes on the yz-plane. Let me try to unpack this step by step.\n\nFirst, let me visualize the problem. There's a sphere that intersects the xy-plane in a circle. The center of that circle is at (2,4,0), and its radius is 1. Then, the same sphere intersects the yz-plane in another circle, centered at (0,4,-7), and I need to find the radius of this second circle, which is r.\n\nHmm, okay. So, the sphere intersects two different planes, each intersection being a circle. The centers of these circles are given, so maybe I can find the center of the sphere and its radius, and then use that to find the radius of the second circle.\n\nLet me recall that when a sphere intersects a plane, the intersection is a circle whose radius can be found using the Pythagorean theorem. Specifically, if the sphere has radius R and the distance from the sphere's center to the plane is d, then the radius of the intersection circle is sqrt(R\u00b2 - d\u00b2). That makes sense because the sphere's radius, the distance from the center to the plane, and the circle's radius form a right triangle.\n\nSo, applying this to both intersections might help me find R, and then I can find r.\n\nLet me denote the center of the sphere as (a, b, c). Since the sphere intersects the xy-plane (where z=0) in a circle centered at (2,4,0), that must mean that the projection of the sphere's center onto the xy-plane is (2,4,0). Similarly, the sphere intersects the yz-plane (where x=0) in a circle centered at (0,4,-7), so the projection of the sphere's center onto the yz-plane is (0,4,-7).\n\nWait, so the center of the sphere (a, b, c) must project onto the xy-plane as (2,4,0). That means that when we set z=0, the center's x and y coordinates are 2 and 4, respectively. Similarly, projecting onto the yz-plane (x=0) gives the center's y and z coordinates as 4 and -7, respectively.\n\nWait, but hold on, the projection of the sphere's center onto the xy-plane is (2,4,0), which would mean that a=2 and b=4, because the projection just drops the z-coordinate. Similarly, the projection onto the yz-plane is (0,4,-7), so that would mean a=0 and c=-7, because the projection drops the x-coordinate.\n\nWait, but this seems contradictory because if a is 2 from the xy-plane projection and 0 from the yz-plane projection, that's impossible unless 2=0, which isn't the case. So I must have made a mistake here.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding how the projections work. Let me think again.\n\nWhen a sphere intersects a plane, the center of the circle of intersection is the projection of the sphere's center onto that plane. So, if the sphere's center is (a, b, c), then the center of the circle where it intersects the xy-plane (z=0) would be (a, b, 0). Similarly, the center of the circle where it intersects the yz-plane (x=0) would be (0, b, c). \n\nWait, so in the problem, the center on the xy-plane is (2,4,0), so that would imply that a=2 and b=4, because the projection of the sphere's center (a, b, c) onto the xy-plane is (a, b, 0). Similarly, the center on the yz-plane is (0,4,-7), so that would mean that the projection is (0, b, c) = (0,4,-7), implying that b=4 and c=-7.\n\nWait, that's consistent! Because if the projection onto the xy-plane is (2,4,0), then a=2, b=4. And the projection onto the yz-plane is (0,4,-7), so b=4, c=-7. So the sphere's center must be at (2,4,-7). That makes sense because when you project (2,4,-7) onto the xy-plane (z=0), you get (2,4,0), and onto the yz-plane (x=0), you get (0,4,-7). Perfect, so the sphere's center is at (2,4,-7).\n\nNow, let me denote the sphere's radius as R. So, the equation of the sphere is (x - 2)^2 + (y - 4)^2 + (z + 7)^2 = R^2.\n\nNow, when this sphere intersects the xy-plane (z=0), the equation becomes (x - 2)^2 + (y - 4)^2 + (0 + 7)^2 = R^2, which simplifies to (x - 2)^2 + (y - 4)^2 + 49 = R^2. But we know that the intersection is a circle with radius 1, so the radius of this circle is 1. Using the formula I thought of earlier, the radius of the intersection circle is sqrt(R^2 - d^2), where d is the distance from the sphere's center to the plane. Since the plane is the xy-plane (z=0), the distance from the center (2,4,-7) to this plane is |c| = |-7| = 7.\n\nSo, the radius of the circle on the xy-plane is sqrt(R^2 - 7^2) = sqrt(R^2 - 49). But we're told this radius is 1, so:\n\nsqrt(R^2 - 49) = 1\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\nR^2 - 49 = 1\n\nSo R^2 = 50.\n\nTherefore, the sphere's radius is sqrt(50), which simplifies to 5*sqrt(2).\n\nNow, I need to find the radius r of the circle where the sphere intersects the yz-plane (x=0). Again, using the same formula: the radius of the intersection circle is sqrt(R^2 - d^2), where d is the distance from the sphere's center to the yz-plane (x=0). The distance from the center (2,4,-7) to the yz-plane is |a| = |2| = 2.\n\nSo, the radius r is sqrt(R^2 - 2^2) = sqrt(50 - 4) = sqrt(46).\n\nWait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my steps.\n\n1. Found the sphere's center by considering the projections onto the xy and yz planes. Got (2,4,-7).\n\n2. Used the intersection with the xy-plane to find R. The circle there has radius 1, and the distance from the center to the plane is 7. So R^2 = 1^2 + 7^2 = 1 + 49 = 50.\n\n3. Then, for the yz-plane intersection, the distance from the center to the plane is 2, so r^2 = R^2 - 2^2 = 50 - 4 = 46, so r = sqrt(46).\n\nWait, that seems correct. Let me check if I applied the formula correctly. The formula is that the radius of the intersection circle is sqrt(R^2 - d^2), where d is the distance from the sphere's center to the plane. Yes, that's right.\n\nAlternatively, I can derive it using the sphere's equation. Let me try that to confirm.\n\nThe sphere's equation is (x - 2)^2 + (y - 4)^2 + (z + 7)^2 = 50.\n\nWhen intersecting with the yz-plane (x=0), substitute x=0:\n\n(0 - 2)^2 + (y - 4)^2 + (z + 7)^2 = 50\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n4 + (y - 4)^2 + (z + 7)^2 = 50\n\nSubtract 4:\n\n(y - 4)^2 + (z + 7)^2 = 46\n\nThis is a circle in the yz-plane with center at (0,4,-7) and radius sqrt(46). So, r = sqrt(46).\n\nYes, that checks out. So I think that's the answer.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there another way this could be approached, just to be thorough?\n\nAnother approach might be to consider the general equation of the sphere and the given circles as sections of the sphere. So, the sphere intersects the xy-plane in a circle, so the equation of the sphere can be written in terms of that circle. Similarly, it intersects the yz-plane in another circle, so we can set up equations to solve for the sphere's center and radius.\n\nBut I think the method I used earlier is sufficient and correct. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning, so I think r is sqrt(46).\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe radius \\( r \\) is \\(\\boxed{\\sqrt{46}}\\).\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by determining the center of the sphere. The sphere intersects the $xy$-plane in a circle centered at $(2, 4, 0)$ and the $yz$-plane in a circle centered at $(0, 4, -7)$. The projections of the sphere's center onto these planes must match these centers. Therefore, the sphere's center is at $(2, 4, -7)$.\n\nNext, we find the radius $R$ of the sphere using the intersection with the $xy$-plane. The radius of the circle formed by this intersection is 1, and the distance from the sphere's center to the $xy$-plane is 7. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we have:\n\\[\n1 = \\sqrt{R^2 - 7^2}\n\\]\nSquaring both sides, we get:\n\\[\n1 = R^2 - 49 \\implies R^2 = 50\n\\]\n\nNow, we use the intersection with the $yz$-plane to find the radius $r$ of the circle. The distance from the sphere's center to the $yz$-plane is 2. Using the Pythagorean theorem again, we have:\n\\[\nr = \\sqrt{R^2 - 2^2}\n\\]\nSubstituting $R^2 = 50$, we get:\n\\[\nr = \\sqrt{50 - 4} = \\sqrt{46}\n\\]\n\nThus, the radius $r$ is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\sqrt{46}}\n\\]",
