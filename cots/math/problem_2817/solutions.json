Problem: What is the area, in square units, of a regular hexagon inscribed in a circle whose area is $324\\pi$ square units? Express your answer in simplest radical form. Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the area of a regular hexagon that's inscribed in a circle. The area of the circle is given as 324\u03c0 square units. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that the area of a circle is calculated using the formula A = \u03c0r\u00b2, where r is the radius. Since the area is 324\u03c0, I can set up the equation \u03c0r\u00b2 = 324\u03c0. To find the radius, I can divide both sides by \u03c0, which gives me r\u00b2 = 324. Taking the square root of both sides, I find that r = \u221a324, which is 18. So, the radius of the circle is 18 units.\n\nNow, the hexagon is regular and inscribed in this circle. I recall that in a regular hexagon, all sides are equal, and all internal angles are equal. Also, importantly, a regular hexagon can be divided into six equilateral triangles, each having two sides that are radii of the circumscribed circle and one side that is a side of the hexagon.\n\nSince each of these triangles is equilateral, all their sides are equal. That means each side of the hexagon is equal to the radius of the circle, which is 18 units. So, each side of the hexagon is 18 units long.\n\nNext, I need to find the area of the regular hexagon. I remember that the area of a regular hexagon can be calculated using the formula:\n\nArea = (3\u221a3 / 2) * s\u00b2\n\nwhere s is the length of a side of the hexagon. Alternatively, since the hexagon is made up of six equilateral triangles, I can also find the area by calculating the area of one equilateral triangle and then multiplying by six.\n\nLet me try both methods to make sure I get the same result.\n\nFirst method: Using the formula for the area of a regular hexagon.\n\nGiven that s = 18, plug it into the formula:\n\nArea = (3\u221a3 / 2) * (18)\u00b2\n\nCalculating 18 squared: 18 * 18 = 324.\n\nSo, Area = (3\u221a3 / 2) * 324\n\nNow, let's compute that. 324 divided by 2 is 162, so:\n\nArea = 3\u221a3 * 162\n\nMultiplying 3 and 162 gives 486, so:\n\nArea = 486\u221a3\n\nSo, that's the area using the first method.\n\nSecond method: Calculating the area of one equilateral triangle and multiplying by six.\n\nThe area of an equilateral triangle with side length s is given by:\n\nArea_triangle = (\u221a3 / 4) * s\u00b2\n\nAgain, s = 18, so:\n\nArea_triangle = (\u221a3 / 4) * (18)\u00b2\n\nWhich is (\u221a3 / 4) * 324\n\nCalculating 324 divided by 4: 324 / 4 = 81, so:\n\nArea_triangle = 81\u221a3\n\nSince there are six such triangles in the hexagon, the total area is:\n\nTotal Area = 6 * 81\u221a3\n\n6 * 81 is 486, so:\n\nTotal Area = 486\u221a3\n\nOkay, both methods give me the same result, which is reassuring. So, the area of the regular hexagon is 486\u221a3 square units.\n\nWait, let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with the area of the circle: 324\u03c0. So, radius squared is 324, so radius is 18. That seems correct.\n\nThen, the side length of the hexagon is equal to the radius, so 18. That makes sense because in a regular hexagon inscribed in a circle, each side is equal to the radius.\n\nUsing the area formula for the hexagon: (3\u221a3 / 2) * s\u00b2. Plugging in 18, so 18 squared is 324. Multiply that by 3\u221a3 / 2: 324 * 3 is 972, divided by 2 is 486, so 486\u221a3. That looks correct.\n\nAlternatively, using the triangle method: each triangle area is (\u221a3 / 4) * 18\u00b2, which is 81\u221a3. Multiply by 6: 81 * 6 is 486, so 486\u221a3. Yep, same result.\n\nI think I'm confident that the area is 486\u221a3 square units.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe area of the regular hexagon is \\boxed{486\\sqrt{3}} square units.\n</think>\n\nFirst, we find the radius of the circle given its area is \\(324\\pi\\) square units. Using the formula for the area of a circle, \\(A = \\pi r^2\\), we have:\n\n\\[\n\\pi r^2 = 324\\pi\n\\]\n\nDividing both sides by \\(\\pi\\):\n\n\\[\nr^2 = 324\n\\]\n\nTaking the square root of both sides:\n\n\\[\nr = \\sqrt{324} = 18\n\\]\n\nThe radius of the circle is 18 units. Since the hexagon is regular and inscribed in the circle, each side of the hexagon is equal to the radius, which is 18 units.\n\nNext, we calculate the area of the regular hexagon. The formula for the area of a regular hexagon with side length \\(s\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2} s^2\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\(s = 18\\):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\times 18^2\n\\]\n\nCalculating \\(18^2\\):\n\n\\[\n18^2 = 324\n\\]\n\nSubstituting back:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\times 324\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = 3\\sqrt{3} \\times 162 = 486\\sqrt{3}\n\\]\n\nThus, the area of the regular hexagon is \\(\\boxed{486\\sqrt{3}}\\) square units.",
