Problem: Alice buys three burgers and two sodas for $\\$3.20$, and Bill buys two burgers and a soda for $\\$2.00$. How many cents does a burger cost? Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out how much a burger costs in cents. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.\n\nAlice buys three burgers and two sodas for $3.20, and Bill buys two burgers and a soda for $2.00. I need to find the cost of one burger in cents. Hmm, okay. So, it's a system of equations problem, right? Because we have two different people buying different quantities and paying different amounts, so we can set up equations based on that.\n\nLet me denote the cost of one burger as 'b' dollars and the cost of one soda as 's' dollars. Since the problem asks for the cost in cents, I might need to convert dollars to cents at the end, but let's see.\n\nFirst, let's write down the equations based on Alice's and Bill's purchases.\n\nAlice buys 3 burgers and 2 sodas for $3.20, so that would be:\n3b + 2s = 3.20\n\nBill buys 2 burgers and 1 soda for $2.00, so that's:\n2b + s = 2.00\n\nOkay, so now I have two equations with two variables. I can solve this system using substitution or elimination. Maybe elimination is easier here because the coefficients are manageable.\n\nLooking at the second equation, 2b + s = 2.00, I can solve for one of the variables in terms of the other. Let's solve for 's' because it has a coefficient of 1, which is simple.\n\nSo, from the second equation:\ns = 2.00 - 2b\n\nNow, I can substitute this expression for 's' into the first equation, which is 3b + 2s = 3.20. Let's do that.\n\nSubstituting s:\n3b + 2*(2.00 - 2b) = 3.20\n\nLet me compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, expand the terms:\n3b + 2*2.00 - 2*2b = 3.20\n\nCalculating the multiplications:\n3b + 4.00 - 4b = 3.20\n\nNow, combine like terms. The terms with 'b' are 3b and -4b.\n\n3b - 4b = -b\n\nSo now the equation is:\n-b + 4.00 = 3.20\n\nLet me write that as:\n- b + 4.00 = 3.20\n\nNow, I can solve for 'b' by isolating it. Let's subtract 4.00 from both sides.\n\n- b = 3.20 - 4.00\n\nCalculating the right side:\n3.20 - 4.00 = -0.80\n\nSo now:\n- b = -0.80\n\nTo solve for 'b', I can multiply both sides by -1.\n\nb = 0.80\n\nSo, the burger costs $0.80. But the question asks for the cost in cents. Since $1 is 100 cents, $0.80 is 80 cents.\n\nWait, let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. It's easy to mess up signs or arithmetic.\n\nStarting from the substitution:\n3b + 2*(2.00 - 2b) = 3.20\n\nWhich becomes:\n3b + 4.00 - 4b = 3.20\n\nCombining 3b - 4b gives -b, so:\n- b + 4.00 = 3.20\n\nSubtract 4.00:\n- b = -0.80\n\nMultiply by -1:\nb = 0.80\n\nYep, that looks correct. So, the burger is $0.80, which is 80 cents.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me check what the soda costs. From the second equation, s = 2.00 - 2b. Since b is 0.80, then:\n\ns = 2.00 - 2*(0.80) = 2.00 - 1.60 = 0.40\n\nSo, the soda is $0.40, which is 40 cents.\n\nLet me verify this with Alice's purchase. She bought 3 burgers and 2 sodas.\n\n3 burgers at $0.80 each: 3 * 0.80 = 2.40\n2 sodas at $0.40 each: 2 * 0.40 = 0.80\nTotal: 2.40 + 0.80 = 3.20\n\nWhich matches the given total. And Bill's purchase: 2 burgers and 1 soda.\n\n2 burgers: 2 * 0.80 = 1.60\n1 soda: 0.40\nTotal: 1.60 + 0.40 = 2.00\n\nThat also matches. So, both purchases check out. Therefore, the burger is indeed 80 cents.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any errors in the calculations. So, the answer is 80 cents per burger.\n</think>\n\nThe cost of one burger is 80 cents.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Define Variables:**\n   - Let \\( b \\) = cost of one burger in dollars.\n   - Let \\( s \\) = cost of one soda in dollars.\n\n2. **Set Up Equations Based on Purchases:**\n   - Alice's purchase: \\( 3b + 2s = 3.20 \\) (Equation 1)\n   - Bill's purchase: \\( 2b + s = 2.00 \\) (Equation 2)\n\n3. **Solve Equation 2 for \\( s \\):**\n   - \\( s = 2.00 - 2b \\)\n\n4. **Substitute \\( s \\) into Equation 1:**\n   - \\( 3b + 2(2.00 - 2b) = 3.20 \\)\n   - Simplify: \\( 3b + 4.00 - 4b = 3.20 \\)\n   - Combine like terms: \\( -b + 4.00 = 3.20 \\)\n\n5. **Solve for \\( b \\):**\n   - Subtract 4.00 from both sides: \\( -b = -0.80 \\)\n   - Multiply by -1: \\( b = 0.80 \\) dollars.\n\n6. **Convert Dollars to Cents:**\n   - \\( 0.80 \\) dollars = \\( 0.80 \\times 100 = 80 \\) cents.\n\n7. **Verify the Solution:**\n   - Calculate soda cost: \\( s = 2.00 - 2(0.80) = 0.40 \\) dollars or 40 cents.\n   - Check Alice's total: \\( 3(0.80) + 2(0.40) = 2.40 + 0.80 = 3.20 \\) dollars.\n   - Check Bill's total: \\( 2(0.80) + 0.40 = 1.60 + 0.40 = 2.00 \\) dollars.\n\nBoth totals match, confirming the solution is correct.\n\n**Answer:** A burger costs \\boxed{80} cents.",
