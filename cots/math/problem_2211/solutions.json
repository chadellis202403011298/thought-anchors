Problem: A standard deck of 52 cards has 13 ranks (Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King) and 4 suits ($\\spadesuit$, $\\heartsuit$, $\\diamondsuit$, and $\\clubsuit$), such that there is exactly one card for any given rank and suit.  Two of the suits ($\\spadesuit$ and $\\clubsuit$) are black and the other two suits ($\\heartsuit$ and $\\diamondsuit$) are red.  The deck is randomly arranged. What is the probability that the top card is red and the second card is black? Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this probability problem here about a standard deck of 52 cards. The question is asking for the probability that the top card is red and the second card is black. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to remember that a standard deck has 52 cards, divided equally into four suits: spades, hearts, diamonds, and clubs. Each suit has 13 cards. Now, spades and clubs are black suits, while hearts and diamonds are red. So, that means there are 26 red cards and 26 black cards in the deck.\n\nThe problem is about arranging the deck randomly and finding the probability that the first card is red and the second card is black. Since the deck is randomly arranged, each permutation of the cards is equally likely. So, I need to figure out how many such permutations meet the condition and then divide that by the total number of possible permutations to get the probability.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a simpler way than calculating the exact number of permutations. I think I can use the concept of dependent events here because the outcome of the first draw affects the outcome of the second draw.\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n1. The probability that the first card is red.\n2. Given that the first card was red, the probability that the second card is black.\n\nThen, I can multiply these two probabilities together to get the overall probability.\n\nStarting with the first part: the probability that the first card is red. Since there are 26 red cards out of 52, that probability is 26/52, which simplifies to 1/2.\n\nNow, for the second part: given that the first card was red, the probability that the second card is black. Since one red card has already been removed, the deck now has 51 cards left. Originally, there were 26 black cards, so the number of black cards remains the same unless a black card was drawn first, which it wasn't. Wait, no, the first card was red, so the number of black cards is still 26. So, now the probability is 26/51.\n\nSo, the combined probability is (1/2) * (26/51). Let me calculate that.\n\nFirst, 1/2 is 0.5, and 26 divided by 51 is approximately 0.5098. Multiplying those together gives roughly 0.2549, which is about 25.49%. But I should express this as a fraction.\n\nLet me compute (26/52) * (26/51). Wait, 26/52 is 1/2, so that's (1/2) * (26/51). Let's multiply the numerators and denominators: 1*26 = 26, and 2*51 = 102. So, 26/102. Now, simplifying that fraction by dividing numerator and denominator by 2: 13/51.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, the probability is 13/51.\n\nLet me check if I did that right. So, first card red: 26/52 = 1/2. Then, after drawing a red card, there are 51 cards left, 26 of which are black. So, 26/51. Multiply them: (1/2)*(26/51) = 26/102 = 13/51. Yep, that looks right.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as the number of favorable outcomes over the total number of possible outcomes. The total number of possible outcomes for the first two cards is 52*51, since the first card can be any of 52 and the second any of the remaining 51.\n\nThe number of favorable outcomes where the first card is red and the second is black is 26 (red cards) * 26 (black cards). So, the probability is (26*26)/(52*51).\n\nCalculating that: numerator is 676, denominator is 2652. Simplifying 676/2652. Let's see, both numbers are divisible by 4: 676 \u00f7 4 = 169, 2652 \u00f7 4 = 663. Now, 169 and 663. Hmm, 169 is 13\u00b2, and 663 \u00f7 13 is 51, because 13*51 = 663. So, 169/663 = 13/51. Yep, same result.\n\nSo, both methods give me 13/51. That seems consistent. I think that's the correct probability.\n</think>\n\nThe probability that the top card is red and the second card is black is calculated by considering the dependent events. First, the probability of drawing a red card is 26/52 = 1/2. Then, given a red card has been drawn, the probability of drawing a black card next is 26/51. Multiplying these probabilities gives (1/2) * (26/51) = 13/51.\n\n$\\boxed{\\dfrac{13}{51}}$",
