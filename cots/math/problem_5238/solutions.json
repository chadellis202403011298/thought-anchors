Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I need to multiply two numbers that are in base 9, which is also called nonary. The numbers are 218_9 and 5_9. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on multiplying in different bases, but I think I can figure this out by breaking it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when multiplying in a base other than 10, it's often easier to convert the numbers to base 10, do the multiplication there since I'm more familiar with it, and then convert the result back to base 9. Let me try that approach.\n\nSo, let's start by converting 218_9 to base 10. To do that, I need to understand what each digit represents. In base 9, the rightmost digit is the ones place (9^0), the middle digit is the nines place (9^1), and the leftmost digit is the eighty-ones place (9^2). \n\nBreaking it down:\n- The rightmost digit is 8, which is 8 * 9^0 = 8 * 1 = 8.\n- The middle digit is 1, which is 1 * 9^1 = 1 * 9 = 9.\n- The leftmost digit is 2, which is 2 * 9^2 = 2 * 81 = 162.\n\nNow, adding those up: 162 + 9 + 8 = 179. So, 218_9 is 179 in base 10.\n\nNext, I need to convert 5_9 to base 10. Well, since it's a single digit, it should be the same, right? So, 5_9 is just 5 in base 10.\n\nNow, I can multiply these two base 10 numbers: 179 * 5. Let me do that multiplication.\n\n179 * 5:\n- 5 * 9 = 45, write down 5 and carry over 4.\n- 5 * 7 = 35, plus the carried over 4 is 39, write down 9 and carry over 3.\n- 5 * 1 = 5, plus the carried over 3 is 8.\nSo, 179 * 5 = 895. Wait, let me check that again because 179 * 5 should be 895. Let me confirm: 179 * 5: 100*5=500, 70*5=350, 9*5=45. Adding those up: 500+350=850, 850+45=895. Yep, that's correct.\n\nNow, I need to convert 895 from base 10 back to base 9. To do that, I can use the division method where I divide the number by 9 and keep track of the remainders.\n\nLet me start dividing 895 by 9:\n- 895 \u00f7 9: How many times does 9 go into 895? Let's see, 9*99=891, which is just under 895. So, 99 times with a remainder of 895 - 891 = 4. So, the first digit (rightmost) is 4.\n- Now, take 99 and divide by 9: 99 \u00f7 9 = 11 with a remainder of 0. So, the next digit is 0.\n- Now, take 11 and divide by 9: 11 \u00f7 9 = 1 with a remainder of 2. So, the next digit is 2.\n- Finally, take 1 and divide by 9: 1 \u00f7 9 = 0 with a remainder of 1. So, the next digit is 1.\n\nNow, reading the remainders from bottom to top, the base 9 number is 1 2 0 4, which is 1204_9.\n\nWait, let me double-check that because sometimes I might make a mistake in the division steps. Let me verify:\n\n1. 9 * 120 = 1080, which is too high because 9*120=1080, but 895 is less than that. Wait, maybe I should approach it differently.\n\nWait, actually, when converting from base 10 to base 9, we take the number and divide by 9, then take the quotient and divide by 9 again, and so on until the quotient is zero. Each remainder becomes a digit in the base 9 number, starting from the least significant digit.\n\nLet me try that again step by step:\n\n- 895 \u00f7 9: 9*99 = 891, as before, so quotient is 99, remainder 4.\n- 99 \u00f7 9: 9*11 = 99, so quotient is 11, remainder 0.\n- 11 \u00f7 9: 9*1 = 9, so quotient is 1, remainder 2.\n- 1 \u00f7 9: 0 quotient, remainder 1.\n\nSo, writing the remainders from last to first: 1, 2, 0, 4. So, 1204_9.\n\nLet me check if 1204_9 is correct by converting it back to base 10 to see if it equals 895.\n\nCalculating 1204_9 in base 10:\n- 1 * 9^3 = 1 * 729 = 729\n- 2 * 9^2 = 2 * 81 = 162\n- 0 * 9^1 = 0 * 9 = 0\n- 4 * 9^0 = 4 * 1 = 4\n\nAdding them up: 729 + 162 = 891, 891 + 0 = 891, 891 + 4 = 895. Perfect, that matches.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can try multiplying directly in base 9 without converting to base 10, just to see if I get the same result. Let me try that approach as a cross-check.\n\nMultiplying 218_9 by 5_9 directly in base 9.\n\nFirst, let's write it down as we do in base 10:\n\n     2 1 8\n   x   5\n   -------\n    \n\nStarting from the rightmost digit:\n\n- 5_9 multiplied by 8_9. Hmm, but I need to remember that in base 9, 5*8 is... wait, in base 10, 5*8=40. But in base 9, what is 40 in base 10 equivalent to in base 9?\n\nWait, 9*4=36, so 40-36=4, so 40 in base 10 is 44_9? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, actually, 40 divided by 9 is 4 with a remainder of 4, so 40 in base 10 is 44_9. Wait, but that seems high. Let me check: 4*9 + 4 = 36 + 4 = 40. Yes, correct. So, 5_9 * 8_9 = 44_9. But wait, that can't be right because 5*8=40 in base 10, which is 44 in base 9. But when multiplying in base 9, each digit must be less than 9, so I can't have a two-digit number in a single digit place. So, I need to carry over.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again.\n\nIn base 9, when you multiply two digits, if the product is equal to or larger than 9, you carry over to the next higher digit.\n\nSo, 5_9 * 8_9: Let's compute 5*8 in base 10, which is 40. Now, to express 40 in base 9, as I did before, it's 4*9 + 4, so 44_9. So, I would write down 4 in the current digit and carry over 4 to the next higher digit.\n\nWait, but that seems a bit off because when you multiply single digits, you should only have a single digit plus a carry. Let me see, perhaps I should compute 5*8 in base 9 directly without converting.\n\nWait, in base 9, each digit is 0-8. So, 5*8 in base 9: Let's compute 5*8 in base 10, which is 40, then convert 40 to base 9.\n\nAs before, 40 \u00f7 9 = 4 with remainder 4, so 40 is 44_9. So, I write down 4 and carry over 4 to the next digit.\n\nWait, but in the multiplication process, when you multiply 5 by 8, you get 40, which is 44_9, so you put down 4 and carry over 4.\n\nNext, moving to the middle digit: 5_9 * 1_9. In base 10, that's 5*1=5. Then, add the carryover of 4, so 5 + 4 = 9. Now, 9 in base 9 is 10_9, so I write down 0 and carry over 1.\n\nWait, 9 in base 9 is represented as 10, so yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, moving to the leftmost digit: 5_9 * 2_9. In base 10, that's 5*2=10. Then, add the carryover of 1, so 10 + 1 = 11. Now, 11 in base 9 is... let's see, 9 goes into 11 once with a remainder of 2, so 11 is 12_9. So, I write down 2 and carry over 1.\n\nWait, but since we're at the leftmost digit, we need to handle that carryover. So, we add that 1 at the beginning.\n\nPutting it all together, the digits we've calculated are:\n\n- Rightmost digit: 4\n- Middle digit: 0\n- Leftmost digit: 2\n- And the final carryover: 1\n\nSo, the result is 1 2 0 4, which is 1204_9. That matches what I got earlier when converting through base 10. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but let me go through that multiplication step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with:\n\n     2 1 8\n   x   5\n   -------\n    \n\nStarting from the right:\n\n- 5 * 8: 5*8=40 in base 10, which is 44_9. So, write down 4, carry over 4.\n\nNext digit:\n\n- 5 * 1 = 5, plus carryover 4 = 9. 9 in base 9 is 10, so write down 0, carry over 1.\n\nNext digit:\n\n- 5 * 2 = 10, plus carryover 1 = 11. 11 in base 9 is 12_9, so write down 2, carry over 1.\n\nSince there are no more digits, we add the carryover 1 at the beginning.\n\nSo, the product is 1 2 0 4, which is 1204_9.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Let me check each step again.\n\n- 5 * 8: 40 in base 10, which is 44_9, so 4 with a carryover of 4.\n\n- 5 * 1: 5 + 4 = 9, which is 10_9, so 0 with a carryover of 1.\n\n- 5 * 2: 10 + 1 = 11, which is 12_9, so 2 with a carryover of 1.\n\n- Finally, the carryover 1 is added to the front, making 1204_9.\n\nYes, that all checks out.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can try another method, like expanding the multiplication using place values in base 9.\n\n218_9 is 2*9^2 + 1*9^1 + 8*9^0.\n\nMultiplying by 5_9, which is 5*9^0.\n\nSo, (2*9^2 + 1*9^1 + 8*9^0) * 5*9^0 = 2*5*9^2 + 1*5*9^1 + 8*5*9^0.\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n- 2*5 = 10, so 10*9^2 = 10*81 = 810 in base 10.\n- 1*5 = 5, so 5*9^1 = 5*9 = 45 in base 10.\n- 8*5 = 40, so 40*9^0 = 40 in base 10.\n\nAdding them up: 810 + 45 = 855, 855 + 40 = 895. So, 895 in base 10, which converts back to 1204_9 as before.\n\nSo, all methods are consistent. Therefore, I'm confident that the product of 218_9 and 5_9 is 1204_9.\n\nJust to recap:\n\n- Converted both numbers to base 10.\n- Multiplied them in base 10.\n- Converted the result back to base 9.\n- Cross-verified by performing the multiplication directly in base 9.\n- Both methods gave the same result.\n\nSo, the final answer is 1204_9.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe product of \\(218_9 \\cdot 5_9\\) is \\boxed{1204_9}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem of finding the product of \\(218_9 \\cdot 5_9\\) and expressing the answer in base 9, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert \\(218_9\\) to base 10:**\n   \\[\n   218_9 = 2 \\cdot 9^2 + 1 \\cdot 9^1 + 8 \\cdot 9^0 = 2 \\cdot 81 + 1 \\cdot 9 + 8 \\cdot 1 = 162 + 9 + 8 = 179_{10}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Convert \\(5_9\\) to base 10:**\n   \\[\n   5_9 = 5_{10}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Multiply the base 10 equivalents:**\n   \\[\n   179_{10} \\cdot 5_{10} = 895_{10}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Convert the product \\(895_{10}\\) back to base 9:**\n   - Divide 895 by 9: quotient 99, remainder 4\n   - Divide 99 by 9: quotient 11, remainder 0\n   - Divide 11 by 9: quotient 1, remainder 2\n   - Divide 1 by 9: quotient 0, remainder 1\n   - Reading the remainders from last to first gives \\(1204_9\\)\n\n5. **Verification by direct multiplication in base 9:**\n   - Multiply each digit of \\(218_9\\) by \\(5_9\\) and handle carries appropriately, resulting in \\(1204_9\\).\n\nBoth methods confirm that the product is \\(1204_9\\).\n\n### Final Answer\nThe product of \\(218_9 \\cdot 5_9\\) is \\(\\boxed{1204_9}\\).",
