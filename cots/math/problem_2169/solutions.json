Hmm, okay. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that a number is divisible by 11 if the alternating sum of its digits is a multiple of 11. That is, for a three-digit number ABC, the condition is (A + C) - B is divisible by 11. So, either (A + C) - B = 0 or 11 or -11, but since A, B, C are digits between 0 and 9, the maximum value of (A + C) - B would be (9 + 9) - 0 = 18, and the minimum would be (0 + 0) - 9 = -9. So, the possible multiples of 11 in this range are -11, 0, and 11. But since (A + C) - B can't be less than -9 or more than 18, the only possible multiples are 0 and 11.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me check that again. If (A + C) - B = 11, then A + C = B + 11. Since A and C are digits (0-9), their sum can be at most 18. So, B + 11 must be \u2264 18, which means B \u2264 7. Similarly, if (A + C) - B = -11, then A + C = B - 11. But A + C is at least 0, so B must be at least 11. But B is a single digit, so B can't be 11 or more. Therefore, the only possible condition is (A + C) - B = 0, which simplifies to A + C = B.\n\nWait, that seems too restrictive. Because I know that, for example, 121 is a multiple of 11 because (1 + 1) - 2 = 0, which is divisible by 11. Similarly, 211 is also a multiple of 11? Wait, let me check 211. (2 + 1) - 1 = 2, which isn't divisible by 11. Hmm, so maybe the example was incorrect? Or maybe I misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait, the problem says that some permutation of its digits is a multiple of 11. So, for 211, if we rearrange the digits, do we get a multiple of 11? Let me see. 211, 121, 112. 121 is a multiple of 11, right? 121 \u00f7 11 = 11, so yes. So, 211 is such a number because one of its permutations, 121, is a multiple of 11.\n\nSo, the key is that the original number doesn't necessarily have to be a multiple of 11, but one of its permutations does. So, I need to count all three-digit numbers where at least one permutation of their digits is a multiple of 11.\n\nSo, first, let me find all three-digit multiples of 11. The smallest three-digit multiple of 11 is 110, and the largest is 990. So, how many three-digit multiples of 11 are there? Well, 990 \u00f7 11 = 90, so there are 90 three-digit multiples of 11 (from 10\u00d711=110 to 90\u00d711=990).\n\nBut the problem is not asking for how many multiples of 11, but how many numbers have a permutation that is a multiple of 11. So, I need to find all three-digit numbers that are permutations of these multiples of 11.\n\nWait, but some numbers might be permutations of more than one multiple of 11, so I have to be careful not to double-count. Hmm, this might get complicated. Maybe I can approach it differently.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the digits of the number. Since a permutation of the digits must form a multiple of 11, the digits must satisfy the divisibility rule for 11 when rearranged. That is, for some permutation, the sum of the digits in the odd positions minus the sum of the digits in the even positions is a multiple of 11.\n\nBut in a three-digit number, the positions are hundreds, tens, and units. So, the rule would be (hundreds digit + units digit) - tens digit is divisible by 11. So, for a three-digit number ABC, (A + C) - B \u2261 0 mod 11.\n\nBut since the number can be permuted, the digits A, B, C can be rearranged such that this condition holds. So, the digits must satisfy that some permutation of them results in (digit1 + digit3) - digit2 \u2261 0 mod 11.\n\nSo, the digits A, B, C must satisfy that for some arrangement, the sum of the first and third digits minus the second digit is 0 mod 11.\n\nTherefore, for the original number, the digits must satisfy that the sum of any two digits minus the third digit is 0 mod 11.\n\nWait, that might not be exactly correct. Because the permutation could be any rearrangement, so we're not limited to just any two digits minus the third. It's more like, among all permutations, there exists one where (digit1 + digit3) - digit2 \u2261 0 mod 11.\n\nAlternatively, for the digits A, B, C, there exists a permutation where (digit1 + digit3) - digit2 is divisible by 11.\n\nSo, another way to think about it is that among the digits, the sum of two digits minus the third is a multiple of 11.\n\nSo, for digits A, B, C, we must have that A + B - C is divisible by 11, or A + C - B is divisible by 11, or B + C - A is divisible by 11.\n\nBecause depending on the permutation, any of the three could be the middle digit.\n\nSo, for the digits A, B, C, at least one of the following must hold:\n\n1. A + B - C \u2261 0 mod 11\n2. A + C - B \u2261 0 mod 11\n3. B + C - A \u2261 0 mod 11\n\nSince A, B, C are digits (0-9), let's see what these conditions imply.\n\nCase 1: A + B - C \u2261 0 mod 11 \u21d2 C = A + B mod 11. But since C is a digit, 0 \u2264 C \u2264 9, so A + B must be less than or equal to 9, or if A + B \u2265 11, then C = A + B - 11.\n\nCase 2: A + C - B \u2261 0 mod 11 \u21d2 B = A + C mod 11. Similarly, B must be between 0 and 9, so A + C must be less than or equal to 9, or if A + C \u2265 11, then B = A + C - 11.\n\nCase 3: B + C - A \u2261 0 mod 11 \u21d2 A = B + C mod 11. Again, A must be between 1 and 9 (since it's a three-digit number), so B + C must be less than or equal to 9, or if B + C \u2265 11, then A = B + C - 11.\n\nSo, in each case, the sum of two digits minus the third must be either 0 or 11. But since all digits are between 0 and 9, the only possibilities are:\n\nEither the sum of two digits equals the third, or the sum of two digits equals the third plus 11.\n\nBut since the maximum sum of two digits is 18, the third digit can be at most 7 for the first case (sum = third digit), because 9 + 9 = 18, which would require the third digit to be 18 - 11 = 7. Wait, no, let me think again.\n\nWait, if we have A + B = C + 11, then since C is a digit, C can be at most 9, so A + B must be at least 11 and at most 20. But A and B are digits, so their sum can be at most 18. Therefore, A + B can be from 11 to 18, so C = A + B - 11 would be from 0 to 7.\n\nSimilarly, in the case where A + B = C, then since C is a digit, A + B can be from 0 to 9.\n\nBut in our case, A is at least 1 because it's a three-digit number, so A is from 1 to 9, B and C are from 0 to 9.\n\nSo, for each case, we can model the possible digits.\n\nBut this seems a bit complicated. Maybe instead of considering all three cases, we can think about the digits in terms of their properties.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to first count all three-digit numbers that are multiples of 11, and then count all their permutations, and then subtract overlaps where a number is a permutation of multiple multiples of 11.\n\nBut that might also be complicated because some numbers might have repeated digits, leading to fewer unique permutations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as follows:\n\nFor each three-digit multiple of 11, count the number of its unique permutations, and then union all these sets together, ensuring we don't double-count numbers that are permutations of multiple multiples of 11.\n\nBut this seems difficult because some numbers might be permutations of more than one multiple of 11, especially if they have repeated digits.\n\nWait, for example, 121 is a multiple of 11, and its permutations include 112 and 211. But 112 is not a multiple of 11, but 211 is not either. Wait, no, 112: (1 + 2) - 1 = 2, which isn't divisible by 11. 211: (2 + 1) - 1 = 2, same thing. So, actually, only 121 is a multiple of 11, but 112 and 211 are not. So, in this case, the permutations don't necessarily result in multiples of 11.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the original number doesn't need to be a multiple of 11, but some permutation of it is. So, for example, 211 is not a multiple of 11, but one of its permutations, 121, is. So, 211 would be counted because it's a permutation of a multiple of 11.\n\nTherefore, to solve the problem, we need to count all three-digit numbers that are permutations of any three-digit multiple of 11.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\n1. Find all three-digit multiples of 11. There are 90 of them, from 110 to 990.\n\n2. For each multiple of 11, generate all its unique permutations, considering that some digits might be repeated.\n\n3. Collect all these permutations, ensuring that we don't count duplicates (i.e., numbers that are permutations of multiple multiples of 11).\n\n4. The total count will be the number of unique permutations across all multiples of 11.\n\nBut this seems computationally intensive, but maybe we can find a pattern or formula.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can categorize the multiples of 11 based on their digit properties and then calculate the number of permutations accordingly.\n\nLet me think about the structure of three-digit multiples of 11.\n\nA three-digit multiple of 11 can be written as 11*k, where k ranges from 10 to 90.\n\nThese numbers have the form ABC, where A, B, C are digits, and (A + C) - B = 0 or 11 or -11, but as we saw earlier, only 0 is possible because of the digit constraints.\n\nWait, no, earlier I thought that (A + C) - B must be 0 mod 11, which could be 0 or 11 or -11, but considering digits, only 0 is possible. But that's only for the number itself. However, when we permute the digits, the condition could be satisfied for another permutation.\n\nWait, but the permutation could have a different arrangement where (digit1 + digit3) - digit2 is 0 mod 11. So, for the original number, the digits must satisfy that some arrangement meets the divisibility rule.\n\nSo, another approach is to consider that for a number ABC, if any permutation of its digits satisfies (digit1 + digit3) - digit2 \u2261 0 mod 11, then ABC is counted.\n\nSo, for ABC, we need that either:\n\n- A + C - B \u2261 0 mod 11,\n\n- A + B - C \u2261 0 mod 11,\n\n- B + C - A \u2261 0 mod 11.\n\nSo, the digits must satisfy at least one of these three conditions.\n\nTherefore, to count all such numbers, we can consider all three-digit numbers and check if any of these three conditions hold.\n\nBut this seems like it would require checking each number, which isn't feasible manually. So, perhaps we can find a smarter way.\n\nLet me consider that for a number ABC, the digits must satisfy that the sum of two digits minus the third is a multiple of 11 (either 0 or 11). Since digits are between 0-9, the only possibilities for the sum minus the third digit are 0 or 11.\n\nSo, for each condition:\n\n1. A + B - C = 0 \u21d2 C = A + B\n\n2. A + B - C = 11 \u21d2 C = A + B - 11\n\n3. A + C - B = 0 \u21d2 B = A + C\n\n4. A + C - B = 11 \u21d2 B = A + C - 11\n\n5. B + C - A = 0 \u21d2 A = B + C\n\n6. B + C - A = 11 \u21d2 A = B + C - 11\n\nBut since A must be at least 1, let's see which of these are possible.\n\nCase 1: C = A + B\n\nSince C is a digit, A + B must be \u2264 9.\n\nCase 2: C = A + B - 11\n\nSince C \u2265 0, A + B must be \u2265 11.\n\nCase 3: B = A + C\n\nSince B is a digit, A + C must be \u2264 9.\n\nCase 4: B = A + C - 11\n\nA + C must be \u2265 11.\n\nCase 5: A = B + C\n\nSince A is at least 1, B + C must be \u2265 1.\n\nBut since A is at most 9, B + C \u2264 9.\n\nCase 6: A = B + C - 11\n\nSince A \u2265 1, B + C must be \u2265 12.\n\nBut B and C are digits, so B + C \u2264 18.\n\nSo, let's analyze each case.\n\nFirst, let's consider cases where the sum equals the third digit:\n\nCase 1: C = A + B, with A + B \u2264 9.\n\nCase 3: B = A + C, with A + C \u2264 9.\n\nCase 5: A = B + C, with B + C \u2264 9.\n\nNow, cases where the sum equals the third digit plus 11:\n\nCase 2: C = A + B - 11, with A + B \u2265 11.\n\nCase 4: B = A + C - 11, with A + C \u2265 11.\n\nCase 6: A = B + C - 11, with B + C \u2265 12.\n\nSo, for each of these cases, we can count the number of valid (A,B,C) triples.\n\nBut since we're dealing with three-digit numbers, A ranges from 1-9, B and C from 0-9.\n\nLet me try to compute the number of solutions for each case.\n\nStarting with Case 1: C = A + B, with A + B \u2264 9.\n\nHere, A ranges from 1-9, B from 0-9, but A + B \u2264 9.\n\nSo, for each A from 1-9, B can range from 0 to 9 - A.\n\nThus, the number of solutions is the sum from A=1 to A=9 of (10 - A), since B can be 0 to (9 - A).\n\nWait, no. For each A, B can be from 0 to (9 - A), inclusive. So, the number of B's is (10 - A).\n\nTherefore, total solutions:\n\nSum_{A=1}^9 (10 - A) = Sum_{k=1}^9 k = 45.\n\nWait, because when A=1, B can be 0-8 (9 options), A=2, B=0-7 (8 options), ..., A=9, B=0 only (1 option). So, total is 9+8+7+...+1 = 45.\n\nSimilarly, Case 3: B = A + C, with A + C \u2264 9.\n\nThis is symmetric to Case 1. For each A, C can range from 0 to 9 - A, and B is determined as A + C.\n\nBut since A is from 1-9, and C from 0-9, with A + C \u2264 9, the number of solutions is the same as Case 1: 45.\n\nSimilarly, Case 5: A = B + C, with B + C \u2264 9.\n\nHere, A is determined by B and C, with B and C from 0-9, and B + C \u2264 9.\n\nBut since A must be at least 1, B + C must be at least 1.\n\nSo, the number of solutions is the number of (B,C) pairs where B + C \u2264 9, minus the case where B + C = 0 (which is only (0,0)).\n\nSo, total (B,C) pairs with B + C \u2264 9: this is a classic problem. The number is (9 + 1)(9 + 2)/2 = 55? Wait, no, that's not the formula.\n\nWait, the number of non-negative integer solutions to B + C \u2264 9 is equal to the sum from k=0 to 9 of (k + 1) = 10*11/2 = 55.\n\nBut since B and C are digits (0-9), so B + C \u2264 9 is the same as B + C = k for k=0 to 9.\n\nSo, the number of solutions is Sum_{k=0}^9 (k + 1) = 55.\n\nBut since A must be at least 1, we subtract the case where B + C = 0, which is only 1 case. So, total solutions: 55 - 1 = 54.\n\nWait, but in Case 5, A = B + C, and A must be from 1-9, so B + C can be from 1-9.\n\nTherefore, the number of solutions is Sum_{k=1}^9 (k + 1) = Sum_{k=1}^9 k + Sum_{k=1}^9 1 = 45 + 9 = 54.\n\nYes, that matches.\n\nNow, moving on to the cases where the sum is 11 more than the third digit.\n\nCase 2: C = A + B - 11, with A + B \u2265 11.\n\nSince C is a digit, 0 \u2264 C \u2264 9, so A + B - 11 \u2265 0 \u21d2 A + B \u2265 11.\n\nAlso, A + B can be at most 18 (since A and B are digits). So, A + B ranges from 11 to 18.\n\nFor each possible sum S = A + B, where S = 11 to 18, the number of (A,B) pairs is:\n\nFor S=11: A can be from 2-9, B=11 - A. So, A=2, B=9; A=3, B=8;...;A=9, B=2. So, 8 solutions.\n\nSimilarly, S=12: A=3-9, B=12 - A. 7 solutions.\n\nS=13: 6 solutions.\n\nS=14: 5 solutions.\n\nS=15: 4 solutions.\n\nS=16: 3 solutions.\n\nS=17: 2 solutions.\n\nS=18: A=9, B=9. 1 solution.\n\nSo, total number of (A,B) pairs for S=11 to 18 is 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 36.\n\nBut in this case, for each (A,B), C is determined as S - 11. Since S ranges from 11 to 18, C = 0 to 7. So, C is a valid digit.\n\nTherefore, total solutions for Case 2: 36.\n\nCase 4: B = A + C - 11, with A + C \u2265 11.\n\nSimilarly, for each (A,C), B is determined as A + C - 11.\n\nA ranges from 1-9, C from 0-9, with A + C \u2265 11.\n\nSo, similar to Case 2, the number of (A,C) pairs where A + C \u2265 11.\n\nFor S = A + C from 11 to 18.\n\nNumber of solutions:\n\nFor S=11: A=2-9, C=11 - A. So, A=2, C=9; A=3, C=8;...;A=9, C=2. 8 solutions.\n\nS=12: A=3-9, C=12 - A. 7 solutions.\n\n...\n\nS=18: A=9, C=9. 1 solution.\n\nTotal solutions: 8 + 7 + ... + 1 = 36.\n\nBut since B = A + C - 11 must be a digit (0-9), and since A + C ranges from 11 to 18, B ranges from 0 to 7. So, B is valid.\n\nTherefore, total solutions for Case 4: 36.\n\nCase 6: A = B + C - 11, with B + C \u2265 12.\n\nHere, A is determined by B and C, with B + C \u2265 12.\n\nSince A must be at least 1 and at most 9, B + C - 11 must be between 1 and 9.\n\nSo, B + C must be between 12 and 20.\n\nBut B and C are digits, so B + C can be from 0 to 18. So, B + C ranges from 12 to 18.\n\nFor each S = B + C from 12 to 18, the number of (B,C) pairs is:\n\nS=12: 11 pairs (B=3,C=9; B=4,C=8;...;B=9,C=3; B=2,C=10 invalid, wait no, B and C are digits, so S=12: B can be 3-9, C=12 - B, which is valid for B=3 to 9, but C must be \u22649. So, B=3, C=9; B=4, C=8;...;B=9, C=3. So, 7 solutions.\n\nWait, no, for S=12, B can be from 3 to 9, but C=12 - B must be \u22649. So, when B=3, C=9; B=4, C=8;...;B=9, C=3. So, 7 solutions.\n\nSimilarly, S=13: B=4-9, C=13 - B, which is valid for B=4-9, so 6 solutions.\n\nS=14: 5 solutions.\n\nS=15: 4 solutions.\n\nS=16: 3 solutions.\n\nS=17: 2 solutions.\n\nS=18: B=9, C=9. 1 solution.\n\nSo, total number of (B,C) pairs for S=12 to 18 is 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 28.\n\nBut in this case, A = B + C - 11 must be at least 1 and at most 9.\n\nSince S ranges from 12 to 18, A = S - 11 ranges from 1 to 7. So, A is valid.\n\nTherefore, total solutions for Case 6: 28.\n\nNow, let's summarize:\n\nCase 1: 45\n\nCase 2: 36\n\nCase 3: 45\n\nCase 4: 36\n\nCase 5: 54\n\nCase 6: 28\n\nBut wait, we need to be careful because some numbers might satisfy more than one case. For example, a number where A + B = C and also A + C - B = 11 might be counted in both Case 1 and Case 3. Similarly, there could be overlaps between cases.\n\nTherefore, to find the total number of unique numbers, we need to use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\n\nBut this might get complicated because we have 6 cases with various overlaps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the original problem: count all three-digit numbers that are permutations of a multiple of 11.\n\nBut since each multiple of 11 can be permuted, and we need to count all unique permutations, considering overlaps.\n\nBut this seems tricky. Maybe another approach is to realize that the numbers we are counting are exactly those numbers whose digits satisfy that the sum of two digits minus the third is a multiple of 11, which includes both cases where the sum equals the third or the third plus 11.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to think about the possible digit combinations.\n\nWait, another idea: since a number is a permutation of a multiple of 11, it must have the same digit multiset as a multiple of 11.\n\nTherefore, the number of such numbers is equal to the number of three-digit numbers that are permutations of some multiple of 11.\n\nSo, if we can find all unique digit multisets that correspond to multiples of 11, and then count how many three-digit numbers can be formed from each multiset, we can sum them up.\n\nBut this requires knowing how many unique digit multisets there are among the multiples of 11, and how many permutations each has.\n\nBut this is still quite involved.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as follows:\n\nEach three-digit multiple of 11 has a digit sum S = A + B + C.\n\nBut the divisibility by 11 is independent of the digit sum, so digit sums can vary.\n\nBut perhaps we can categorize the multiples of 11 based on their digit properties.\n\nWait, another idea: instead of trying to count all numbers that are permutations, maybe it's easier to realize that each multiple of 11 contributes a certain number of permutations, and we can sum these up, but subtract the overlaps.\n\nBut this might not be straightforward.\n\nWait, let me think differently. The total number of three-digit numbers is 900 (from 100 to 999). We need to count how many of these have a permutation that is a multiple of 11.\n\nEach multiple of 11 can be permuted into several numbers, and we need to count all such numbers, but ensuring that we don't double-count numbers that are permutations of multiple multiples of 11.\n\nBut this seems too vague.\n\nWait, perhaps we can think about the fact that the number of such numbers is equal to the number of three-digit numbers where the digits satisfy that the sum of two digits minus the third is a multiple of 11, which we have already considered in Cases 1-6.\n\nBut since some numbers might satisfy more than one condition, we need to find the union of all these cases.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can compute the total number of numbers in Cases 1-6, and then subtract the overlaps.\n\nBut this would require knowing how many numbers are in the intersections of these cases.\n\nThis seems complicated, but perhaps manageable.\n\nLet me denote the sets:\n\nLet S1 be the set of numbers where C = A + B.\n\nS2: C = A + B - 11\n\nS3: B = A + C\n\nS4: B = A + C - 11\n\nS5: A = B + C\n\nS6: A = B + C - 11\n\nWe need to find |S1 \u222a S2 \u222a S3 \u222a S4 \u222a S5 \u222a S6|.\n\nBy the inclusion-exclusion principle:\n\n|S1 \u222a S2 \u222a S3 \u222a S4 \u222a S5 \u222a S6| = \u03a3|Si| - \u03a3|Si \u2229 Sj| + \u03a3|Si \u2229 Sj \u2229 Sk| - ... + (-1)^{n+1}|S1 \u2229 S2 \u2229 ... \u2229 Sn}|.\n\nBut this is very complex because there are 6 sets, leading to many intersections.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find that the overlaps are minimal or can be calculated.\n\nBut this seems too time-consuming.\n\nWait, maybe instead of trying to compute all overlaps, we can find that the total number is equal to the sum of all cases minus the overlaps.\n\nBut without knowing the overlaps, it's difficult.\n\nWait, perhaps instead of trying to compute this directly, we can note that the numbers we are trying to count are exactly those numbers where the digits satisfy that the sum of two digits minus the third is 0 or 11.\n\nSo, in other words, the digits must satisfy that either:\n\n- The sum of two digits equals the third, or\n\n- The sum of two digits equals the third plus 11.\n\nTherefore, for each number, we can check if any two digits sum to the third or the third plus 11.\n\nSo, let's consider the possible digit combinations.\n\nFirst, for the sum equals the third digit:\n\nThis is similar to the concept of a \"balanced\" set of digits, where one digit is the sum of the other two.\n\nSimilarly, for the sum equals the third plus 11, which is a kind of \"near balanced\" set.\n\nSo, perhaps we can count the number of such digit triplets.\n\nBut again, it's complicated.\n\nWait, another idea: for each possible digit triplet (A,B,C), check if any permutation satisfies (digit1 + digit3) - digit2 \u2261 0 mod 11.\n\nBut since this is a three-digit number, we can represent it as ABC, and check the three conditions:\n\n1. (A + C) - B \u2261 0 mod 11\n\n2. (A + B) - C \u2261 0 mod 11\n\n3. (B + C) - A \u2261 0 mod 11\n\nIf any of these hold, then the number is counted.\n\nTherefore, the total number of such numbers is equal to the number of three-digit numbers where at least one of the above three conditions holds.\n\nSo, perhaps we can compute this by considering all possible (A,B,C) and checking these conditions.\n\nBut since this is time-consuming, maybe we can find a pattern.\n\nWait, perhaps we can think in terms of the possible differences.\n\nLet me consider that for a number ABC, the differences (A + C) - B, (A + B) - C, and (B + C) - A can be 0, 11, or -11.\n\nBut since digits are between 0-9, the differences can only be 0 or 11, as -11 is too low.\n\nSo, for each number, we need at least one of these differences to be 0 or 11.\n\nBut since we're dealing with three-digit numbers, A is at least 1.\n\nLet me think about how many numbers satisfy each condition.\n\nFirst, let's compute the number of numbers where (A + C) - B = 0.\n\nThis is equivalent to B = A + C.\n\nWe already considered this in Case 3.\n\nWe found that there are 45 such numbers.\n\nSimilarly, the number of numbers where (A + C) - B = 11 is equivalent to B = A + C - 11.\n\nThis is Case 4, which had 36 numbers.\n\nSimilarly, the number of numbers where (A + B) - C = 0 is equivalent to C = A + B, which is Case 1 with 45 numbers.\n\nAnd (A + B) - C = 11 is equivalent to C = A + B - 11, which is Case 2 with 36 numbers.\n\nSimilarly, the number of numbers where (B + C) - A = 0 is equivalent to A = B + C, which is Case 5 with 54 numbers.\n\nAnd (B + C) - A = 11 is equivalent to A = B + C - 11, which is Case 6 with 28 numbers.\n\nSo, the total number of numbers satisfying any of these conditions is the sum of all these cases: 45 + 36 + 45 + 36 + 54 + 28 = 244.\n\nBut wait, this counts numbers that satisfy multiple conditions multiple times. For example, a number where both B = A + C and C = A + B - 11 might be counted in both Case 1 and Case 2.\n\nTherefore, we need to subtract the overlaps.\n\nSo, let's compute the overlaps.\n\nFirst, find the number of numbers that satisfy both (A + C) - B = 0 and (A + B) - C = 0.\n\nThat is, B = A + C and C = A + B.\n\nSubstituting B from the first equation into the second: C = A + (A + C) \u21d2 C = 2A + C \u21d2 2A = 0 \u21d2 A = 0.\n\nBut A cannot be 0 in a three-digit number. So, no overlaps between Case 1 and Case 3.\n\nSimilarly, check overlaps between other cases.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think that each overlap would require two different conditions to hold simultaneously.\n\nFor example, suppose a number satisfies both (A + C) - B = 0 and (A + B) - C = 0.\n\nThen, we have B = A + C and C = A + B.\n\nSubstituting, B = A + (A + B) \u21d2 B = 2A + B \u21d2 2A = 0 \u21d2 A = 0, which is impossible.\n\nTherefore, no overlaps between Case 1 and Case 3.\n\nSimilarly, check overlaps between Case 1 and Case 4.\n\nCase 1: C = A + B\n\nCase 4: B = A + C - 11\n\nSubstitute C from Case 1 into Case 4: B = A + (A + B) - 11 \u21d2 B = 2A + B - 11 \u21d2 2A = 11 \u21d2 A = 5.5, which is not an integer. So, no overlaps.\n\nSimilarly, overlaps between Case 1 and Case 5.\n\nCase 1: C = A + B\n\nCase 5: A = B + C\n\nSubstitute C from Case 1 into Case 5: A = B + (A + B) \u21d2 A = A + 2B \u21d2 2B = 0 \u21d2 B = 0.\n\nSo, if B = 0, then from Case 1: C = A + 0 = A.\n\nFrom Case 5: A = 0 + C \u21d2 A = C, which is consistent.\n\nTherefore, numbers where B = 0 and C = A.\n\nSo, these are numbers of the form A0A, where A is from 1-9.\n\nHow many such numbers? 9 (101, 202, ..., 909).\n\nTherefore, overlaps between Case 1 and Case 5: 9 numbers.\n\nSimilarly, overlaps between Case 1 and Case 6.\n\nCase 1: C = A + B\n\nCase 6: A = B + C - 11\n\nSubstitute C from Case 1: A = B + (A + B) - 11 \u21d2 A = 2B + A - 11 \u21d2 2B = 11 \u21d2 B = 5.5, not possible. So, no overlaps.\n\nSimilarly, overlaps between Case 2 and other cases.\n\nCase 2: C = A + B - 11\n\nCase 3: B = A + C\n\nSubstitute C from Case 2 into Case 3:",
