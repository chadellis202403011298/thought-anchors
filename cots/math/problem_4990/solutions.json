Problem: Cameron writes down the smallest positive multiple of 20 that is a perfect square, the smallest positive multiple of 20 that is a perfect cube, and all the multiples of 20 between them.  How many integers are in Cameron's list? Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how many integers are in Cameron's list. The problem says Cameron writes down the smallest positive multiple of 20 that is a perfect square, the smallest positive multiple of 20 that is a perfect cube, and all the multiples of 20 between them. I need to find how many integers are in that list.\n\nFirst, let me break down what's being asked. Cameron is listing numbers that are multiples of 20, starting from the smallest multiple of 20 that's a perfect square, going up to the smallest multiple of 20 that's a perfect cube, and including all multiples of 20 in between those two numbers. So, I need to find those two numbers first\u2014the smallest multiple of 20 that's a perfect square and the smallest that's a perfect cube. Then, I can figure out how many multiples of 20 are in between them, including both endpoints.\n\nLet me start with the smallest positive multiple of 20 that's a perfect square. A multiple of 20 can be written as 20 times some integer. So, 20k, where k is a positive integer. For 20k to be a perfect square, all the exponents in its prime factorization must be even.\n\nLet me factorize 20. 20 is 2^2 * 5^1. So, 20k = 2^2 * 5^1 * k. For this product to be a perfect square, the exponents of all prime factors must be even. So, looking at 20k, the exponent of 2 is already 2, which is even. The exponent of 5 is 1, which is odd. Therefore, k must supply another 5 to make it 5^2. Additionally, k should not introduce any new prime factors with odd exponents. So, the smallest k is 5. Therefore, the smallest multiple of 20 that's a perfect square is 20 * 5 = 100.\n\nWait, let me check that. 100 is indeed a multiple of 20, and it's 10^2, so yes, it's a perfect square. So, the first number is 100.\n\nNow, moving on to the smallest positive multiple of 20 that's a perfect cube. Again, 20k, where k is a positive integer. Let's factorize 20: 2^2 * 5^1. For 20k to be a perfect cube, all exponents in its prime factorization must be multiples of 3.\n\nSo, 20k = 2^2 * 5^1 * k. The exponent of 2 is 2, which needs to be increased to the next multiple of 3, which is 3. So, k needs to contribute 2^(3-2) = 2^1. Similarly, the exponent of 5 is 1, which needs to be increased to 3, so k needs to contribute 5^(3-1) = 5^2. Therefore, k must be 2^1 * 5^2 = 2 * 25 = 50. Therefore, the smallest multiple of 20 that's a perfect cube is 20 * 50 = 1000.\n\nWait, let me confirm. 1000 is 10^3, which is a perfect cube, and it's a multiple of 20 because 1000 divided by 20 is 50, which is an integer. So, yes, 1000 is correct.\n\nSo, Cameron's list starts at 100 and ends at 1000, including all multiples of 20 in between. Now, I need to find how many integers are in this list. So, it's essentially an arithmetic sequence where the first term is 100, the last term is 1000, and the common difference is 20. I need to find the number of terms in this sequence.\n\nThe formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence is:\n\nn = ((last term - first term) / common difference) + 1\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nn = ((1000 - 100) / 20) + 1\n\nFirst, calculate 1000 - 100, which is 900.\n\nThen, divide 900 by 20, which is 45.\n\nThen, add 1, so 45 + 1 = 46.\n\nWait, so there are 46 terms in Cameron's list.\n\nLet me double-check that. Starting at 100, each term increases by 20. So, the terms would be 100, 120, 140, ..., 1000.\n\nTo find the number of terms, another way is to see how many steps of 20 are between 100 and 1000, inclusive.\n\nSo, the difference between 1000 and 100 is 900, as before. Each step is 20, so the number of steps is 900 / 20 = 45. But since we include both the starting and ending points, we add 1, giving 46.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about the nth term of an arithmetic sequence: a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d. Here, a_n is 1000, a_1 is 100, d is 20.\n\nSo, 1000 = 100 + (n - 1)*20\n\nSubtract 100 from both sides: 900 = (n - 1)*20\n\nDivide both sides by 20: 45 = n - 1\n\nAdd 1: n = 46.\n\nYes, that confirms it again. So, there are 46 integers in Cameron's list.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, the answer should be 46.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of integers in Cameron's list is \\boxed{46}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many integers are in Cameron's list, we need to find the smallest positive multiple of 20 that is a perfect square, the smallest positive multiple of 20 that is a perfect cube, and then count all the multiples of 20 between them, including both endpoints.\n\n1. **Smallest positive multiple of 20 that is a perfect square:**\n   - Factorize 20: \\(20 = 2^2 \\times 5\\).\n   - For \\(20k\\) to be a perfect square, \\(k\\) must provide another factor of 5.\n   - The smallest \\(k\\) is 5, so the smallest multiple is \\(20 \\times 5 = 100\\).\n\n2. **Smallest positive multiple of 20 that is a perfect cube:**\n   - Factorize 20: \\(20 = 2^2 \\times 5\\).\n   - For \\(20k\\) to be a perfect cube, \\(k\\) must provide factors to make the exponents of 2 and 5 multiples of 3.\n   - The smallest \\(k\\) is \\(2 \\times 5^2 = 50\\), so the smallest multiple is \\(20 \\times 50 = 1000\\).\n\n3. **Count the multiples of 20 between 100 and 1000, inclusive:**\n   - This forms an arithmetic sequence with the first term \\(a_1 = 100\\), the last term \\(a_n = 1000\\), and the common difference \\(d = 20\\).\n   - The number of terms \\(n\\) in the sequence is calculated by:\n     \\[\n     n = \\frac{(1000 - 100)}{20} + 1 = \\frac{900}{20} + 1 = 45 + 1 = 46\n     \\]\n\nThus, the number of integers in Cameron's list is \\(\\boxed{46}\\).",
