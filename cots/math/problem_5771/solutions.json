(Recall that the average of two numbers is their sum divided by 2). Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this math problem here. It says, \"The average of the numbers 23 and x is 27. What is the positive difference between 23 and x?\" Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the average of two numbers is their sum divided by 2. So, if the average of 23 and x is 27, that means when I add 23 and x together and then divide by 2, I get 27. Let me write that down as an equation to make it clearer.\n\nSo, the average formula would be: (23 + x) / 2 = 27.\n\nNow, I need to solve for x. To do that, I can start by getting rid of the denominator, which is 2. I'll multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the division.\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2 gives me: 23 + x = 54. Wait, because 27 times 2 is 54, right? Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nOkay, so now I have 23 + x = 54. I need to find x, so I should subtract 23 from both sides to isolate x. Let me do that.\n\nSubtracting 23 from both sides: x = 54 - 23. Hmm, 54 minus 20 is 34, and then minus 3 more is 31. So, x equals 31.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. If I add 23 and 31 together, that's 54. Then, 54 divided by 2 is indeed 27. So, that checks out. So, x is 31.\n\nNow, the problem asks for the positive difference between 23 and x. The positive difference means the absolute value of their difference, so it's just the bigger number minus the smaller one, regardless of which is which.\n\nSo, since x is 31 and the other number is 23, I can subtract 23 from 31. That's 31 - 23, which is 8. So, the positive difference is 8.\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. If x was less than 23, would the positive difference still be the same? Let's see, suppose x was 19, then 23 - 19 is 4, which is positive. But in this case, x is 31, which is larger, so 31 - 23 is 8. Either way, the positive difference is just the absolute value, so it's 8 in this case.\n\nLet me just recap everything to make sure I didn't skip any steps. The average of 23 and x is 27, so I set up the equation (23 + x)/2 = 27. Multiplying both sides by 2 gives 23 + x = 54. Subtracting 23 from both sides gives x = 31. Then, the positive difference between 23 and 31 is 8. Yep, that all makes sense.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. The calculations seem straightforward, and each step follows logically from the previous one. So, I'm pretty confident that the positive difference is 8.\n</think>\n\nThe average of 23 and x is 27, so we set up the equation (23 + x)/2 = 27. Multiplying both sides by 2 gives 23 + x = 54. Subtracting 23 from both sides yields x = 31. The positive difference between 23 and 31 is 8.\n\n$\\boxed{8}$",
