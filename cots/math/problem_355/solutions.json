Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated, but let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that f(x) is a quadratic function, so it's a parabola. The Asymptote code defines f(x) as (x^2)/4 + x - 3. Let me write that down to make it clear:\n\nf(x) = (x\u00b2)/4 + x - 3\n\nAlright, so I can work with this function directly. The problem is asking for f(f(f(x))) = -3, which means I have to apply the function f three times, and set that equal to -3. So, I need to find all x such that when I apply f three times, I get -3.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. Since f is quadratic, each time I apply f, it's going to be a quadratic equation. So, f(f(f(x))) is going to involve solving multiple quadratic equations. That might lead to multiple solutions each time, so I need to be careful to consider all possible solutions at each step.\n\nLet me structure this step by step:\n\n1. Let me first find all solutions to f(y) = -3, where y is some number. Then, for each solution y, I'll find all solutions to f(z) = y, and so on, until I get back to x.\n\nWait, actually, since f(f(f(x))) = -3, maybe I should work from the inside out. Let me define it as:\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n- Let\u2019s say f(f(f(x))) = -3\n- Let me let y = f(f(x)). So, then f(y) = -3\n- Then, let me find all y such that f(y) = -3\n- For each such y, I need to find all z such that f(z) = y\n- Then, for each such z, find all x such that f(x) = z\n- Finally, collect all such x and sum them up.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I need to solve f(y) = -3 first, then for each solution y, solve f(z) = y, and so on until I get to x.\n\nLet me start with the first step: solving f(y) = -3.\n\nGiven f(y) = (y\u00b2)/4 + y - 3 = -3\n\nSo, set up the equation:\n\n(y\u00b2)/4 + y - 3 = -3\n\nLet me subtract -3 from both sides to get:\n\n(y\u00b2)/4 + y - 3 + 3 = 0\n\nSimplify:\n\n(y\u00b2)/4 + y = 0\n\nMultiply both sides by 4 to eliminate the denominator:\n\ny\u00b2 + 4y = 0\n\nFactor:\n\ny(y + 4) = 0\n\nSo, the solutions are y = 0 and y = -4.\n\nAlright, so f(y) = -3 has two solutions: y = 0 and y = -4.\n\nNow, moving one step back, we have f(z) = y, where y can be 0 or -4. So, I need to solve f(z) = 0 and f(z) = -4 separately.\n\nLet me first solve f(z) = 0.\n\nSet f(z) = 0:\n\n(z\u00b2)/4 + z - 3 = 0\n\nMultiply both sides by 4:\n\nz\u00b2 + 4z - 12 = 0\n\nUse quadratic formula:\n\nz = [-4 \u00b1 sqrt(16 + 48)] / 2\n\nBecause discriminant D = 16 + 48 = 64\n\nSo, sqrt(64) = 8\n\nThus,\n\nz = [-4 + 8]/2 = 4/2 = 2\n\nz = [-4 - 8]/2 = -12/2 = -6\n\nSo, the solutions are z = 2 and z = -6.\n\nNow, solve f(z) = -4.\n\nSet f(z) = -4:\n\n(z\u00b2)/4 + z - 3 = -4\n\nAdd 4 to both sides:\n\n(z\u00b2)/4 + z - 3 + 4 = 0\n\nSimplify:\n\n(z\u00b2)/4 + z + 1 = 0\n\nMultiply both sides by 4:\n\nz\u00b2 + 4z + 4 = 0\n\nThis factors as:\n\n(z + 2)\u00b2 = 0\n\nSo, z = -2 is a double root. But since we are looking for distinct solutions, z = -2 is the only solution here.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure if z = -2 is a distinct solution or not. Since it's a double root, but in the context of real solutions, it's just one solution. So, when moving back to find x, each solution for z will lead to solving f(x) = z, which may have multiple solutions.\n\nSo, summarizing the second step:\n\n- For y = 0, we have z solutions: 2 and -6\n- For y = -4, we have z solution: -2\n\nSo, all z solutions are 2, -6, and -2.\n\nNow, moving back another step, we have f(x) = z, where z is 2, -6, or -2. So, I need to solve f(x) = 2, f(x) = -6, and f(x) = -2.\n\nLet me handle each case separately.\n\nFirst, f(x) = 2.\n\nSet f(x) = 2:\n\n(x\u00b2)/4 + x - 3 = 2\n\nSubtract 2:\n\n(x\u00b2)/4 + x - 5 = 0\n\nMultiply by 4:\n\nx\u00b2 + 4x - 20 = 0\n\nQuadratic formula:\n\nx = [-4 \u00b1 sqrt(16 + 80)] / 2\n\nsqrt(96) = sqrt(16*6) = 4*sqrt(6)\n\nSo,\n\nx = [-4 + 4\u221a6]/2 = (-4)/2 + (4\u221a6)/2 = -2 + 2\u221a6\n\nx = [-4 - 4\u221a6]/2 = -2 - 2\u221a6\n\nSo, solutions are x = -2 + 2\u221a6 and x = -2 - 2\u221a6.\n\nSecond, f(x) = -6.\n\nSet f(x) = -6:\n\n(x\u00b2)/4 + x - 3 = -6\n\nAdd 6:\n\n(x\u00b2)/4 + x + 3 = 0\n\nMultiply by 4:\n\nx\u00b2 + 4x + 12 = 0\n\nQuadratic formula:\n\nx = [-4 \u00b1 sqrt(16 - 48)] / 2\n\nsqrt(-32) is imaginary, so no real solutions here.\n\nThird, f(x) = -2.\n\nSet f(x) = -2:\n\n(x\u00b2)/4 + x - 3 = -2\n\nAdd 2:\n\n(x\u00b2)/4 + x - 1 = 0\n\nMultiply by 4:\n\nx\u00b2 + 4x - 4 = 0\n\nQuadratic formula:\n\nx = [-4 \u00b1 sqrt(16 + 16)] / 2\n\nsqrt(32) = 4\u221a2\n\nSo,\n\nx = [-4 + 4\u221a2]/2 = (-4)/2 + (4\u221a2)/2 = -2 + 2\u221a2\n\nx = [-4 - 4\u221a2]/2 = -2 - 2\u221a2\n\nSo, solutions are x = -2 + 2\u221a2 and x = -2 - 2\u221a2.\n\nNow, compiling all solutions for x:\n\nFrom f(x) = 2: x = -2 + 2\u221a6 and x = -2 - 2\u221a6\n\nFrom f(x) = -6: no real solutions\n\nFrom f(x) = -2: x = -2 + 2\u221a2 and x = -2 - 2\u221a2\n\nSo, all distinct real solutions are:\n\nx = -2 + 2\u221a6, x = -2 - 2\u221a6, x = -2 + 2\u221a2, x = -2 - 2\u221a2\n\nNow, the problem asks for the sum of all distinct numbers x that satisfy f(f(f(x))) = -3.\n\nSo, let me sum these solutions:\n\nSum = (-2 + 2\u221a6) + (-2 - 2\u221a6) + (-2 + 2\u221a2) + (-2 - 2\u221a2)\n\nLet me compute term by term:\n\nFirst, combine the constants:\n\n-2 -2 -2 -2 = (-2)*4 = -8\n\nNow, the radical terms:\n\n2\u221a6 - 2\u221a6 + 2\u221a2 - 2\u221a2\n\nNotice that 2\u221a6 - 2\u221a6 cancels out to 0, and similarly, 2\u221a2 - 2\u221a2 cancels out to 0.\n\nSo, the total sum is -8.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, all the radical parts cancel each other, and we're just left with -8.\n\nIs that correct? Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, when I solved f(y) = -3, I got y = 0 and y = -4. That seems correct.\n\nThen, for each y, I solved f(z) = y.\n\nFor y = 0, I got z = 2 and z = -6. That seems correct because plugging z=2 into f(z) gives (4)/4 + 2 - 3 = 1 + 2 - 3 = 0, which is correct. Similarly, z = -6: (36)/4 + (-6) - 3 = 9 - 6 - 3 = 0, correct.\n\nFor y = -4, I got z = -2 as a double root. Plugging z = -2 into f(z): (4)/4 + (-2) - 3 = 1 - 2 - 3 = -4, which is correct.\n\nThen, moving on to solve f(x) = z for each z:\n\nFor z = 2: f(x) = 2, solutions x = -2 + 2\u221a6 and x = -2 - 2\u221a6.\n\nFor z = -6: f(x) = -6 has no real solutions.\n\nFor z = -2: f(x) = -2, solutions x = -2 + 2\u221a2 and x = -2 - 2\u221a2.\n\nSo, all x solutions are as above.\n\nSumming them up:\n\n(-2 + 2\u221a6) + (-2 - 2\u221a6) + (-2 + 2\u221a2) + (-2 - 2\u221a2)\n\nYes, when we add these, the \u221a6 and \u221a2 terms cancel out, leaving -8.\n\nHmm, so the sum is -8. That seems a bit straightforward, but I think it's correct because the roots come in pairs that are symmetric around the vertex of the parabola, so their sum is twice the x-coordinate of the vertex times the number of such pairs.\n\nWait, let me think about that. The function f(x) is a quadratic, so its graph is a parabola. The roots of f(x) = k (for some constant k) will be symmetric around the vertex's x-coordinate. So, if I have two roots for f(x) = k, their sum will be twice the x-coordinate of the vertex.\n\nGiven that f(x) = (x\u00b2)/4 + x - 3, let me find its vertex.\n\nThe standard form of a quadratic is ax\u00b2 + bx + c. Here, a = 1/4, b = 1, c = -3.\n\nThe x-coordinate of the vertex is at -b/(2a) = -1/(2*(1/4)) = -1/(1/2) = -2.\n\nSo, the vertex is at x = -2.\n\nTherefore, for any horizontal line f(x) = k, the roots will be symmetric around x = -2. So, if I have two roots, their sum will be 2*(-2) = -4.\n\nWait, but in our case, for each z, we have two roots, except when z leads to a double root or no real roots.\n\nWait, let me think again.\n\nWhen I solved f(x) = 2, I got two roots: -2 + 2\u221a6 and -2 - 2\u221a6. Their sum is (-2 + 2\u221a6) + (-2 - 2\u221a6) = -4.\n\nSimilarly, for f(x) = -2, I got two roots: -2 + 2\u221a2 and -2 - 2\u221a2, which also sum to -4.\n\nSo, each pair of roots sums to -4, and since we have two such pairs, the total sum is -4 + (-4) = -8.\n\nAh, so that's why the total sum is -8. That makes sense because each quadratic equation contributes a sum of -4, and we have two quadratics contributing (from z=2 and z=-2), so 2*(-4) = -8.\n\nSo, that's consistent with the vertex's x-coordinate.\n\nTherefore, the sum of all distinct real solutions x is -8.\n\nI think that's the answer. Let me just recap the steps to make sure I didn't skip anything:\n\n1. Solved f(y) = -3, got y = 0 and y = -4.\n\n2. For each y, solved f(z) = y:\n   - For y=0: z=2 and z=-6\n   - For y=-4: z=-2\n\n3. For each z, solved f(x) = z:\n   - For z=2: x=-2+2\u221a6 and x=-2-2\u221a6\n   - For z=-6: No real solutions\n   - For z=-2: x=-2+2\u221a2 and x=-2-2\u221a2\n\n4. Collected all x solutions: four in total, two from z=2 and two from z=-2.\n\n5. Summed them up, noticing that each pair of solutions for f(x)=k sums to -4, so total sum is -8.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations, and the logic follows. So, I'm confident the answer is -8.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{-8}\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to find the sum of all distinct numbers \\( x \\) such that \\( f(f(f(x))) = -3 \\) where \\( f(x) = \\frac{x^2}{4} + x - 3 \\).\n\n1. **Solve \\( f(y) = -3 \\):**\n   \\[\n   \\frac{y^2}{4} + y - 3 = -3\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, we get:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{y^2}{4} + y = 0 \\implies y(y + 4) = 0\n   \\]\n   Solutions: \\( y = 0 \\) and \\( y = -4 \\).\n\n2. **Solve \\( f(z) = y \\) for each \\( y \\):**\n   - For \\( y = 0 \\):\n     \\[\n     \\frac{z^2}{4} + z - 3 = 0\n     \\]\n     Simplifying, we get:\n     \\[\n     z^2 + 4z - 12 = 0\n     \\]\n     Solutions: \\( z = 2 \\) and \\( z = -6 \\).\n   - For \\( y = -4 \\):\n     \\[\n     \\frac{z^2}{4} + z - 3 = -4\n     \\]\n     Simplifying, we get:\n     \\[\n     z^2 + 4z + 4 = 0 \\implies (z + 2)^2 = 0\n     \\]\n     Solution: \\( z = -2 \\).\n\n3. **Solve \\( f(x) = z \\) for each \\( z \\):**\n   - For \\( z = 2 \\):\n     \\[\n     \\frac{x^2}{4} + x - 3 = 2\n     \\]\n     Simplifying, we get:\n     \\[\n     x^2 + 4x - 20 = 0\n     \\]\n     Solutions: \\( x = -2 + 2\\sqrt{6} \\) and \\( x = -2 - 2\\sqrt{6} \\).\n   - For \\( z = -6 \\):\n     \\[\n     \\frac{x^2}{4} + x - 3 = -6\n     \\]\n     Simplifying, we get:\n     \\[\n     x^2 + 4x + 12 = 0\n     \\]\n     No real solutions.\n   - For \\( z = -2 \\):\n     \\[\n     \\frac{x^2}{4} + x - 3 = -2\n     \\]\n     Simplifying, we get:\n     \\[\n     x^2 + 4x - 4 = 0\n     \\]\n     Solutions: \\( x = -2 + 2\\sqrt{2} \\) and \\( x = -2 - 2\\sqrt{2} \\).\n\n4. **Sum all distinct solutions:**\n   - Solutions from \\( z = 2 \\): \\( -2 + 2\\sqrt{6} \\) and \\( -2 - 2\\sqrt{6} \\).\n   - Solutions from \\( z = -2 \\): \\( -2 + 2\\sqrt{2} \\) and \\( -2 - 2\\sqrt{2} \\).\n\n   Summing these solutions:\n   \\[\n   (-2 + 2\\sqrt{6}) + (-2 - 2\\sqrt{6}) + (-2 + 2\\sqrt{2}) + (-2 - 2\\sqrt{2}) = -8\n   \\]\n\nThus, the sum of all distinct numbers \\( x \\) is \\(\\boxed{-8}\\).",
