Problem: Given a sequence $a_1,$ $a_2,$ $a_3,$ $\\dots,$ let $S_n$ denote the sum of the first $n$ terms of the sequence.\n\nIf $a_1 = 1$ and\n\\[a_n = \\frac{2S_n^2}{2S_n - 1}\\]for all $n \\ge 2,$ then find $a_{100}.$ Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to find the 100th term of a sequence, a_{100}. The sequence is defined such that a_1 is 1, and for every n greater than or equal to 2, a_n is equal to (2S_n^2)/(2S_n - 1), where S_n is the sum of the first n terms of the sequence. Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated, but let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's make sure I understand the problem correctly. We have a sequence where the first term is 1, and each subsequent term is defined in terms of the sum of all the terms up to that point. So, S_n = a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_n, and a_n is given by this fraction involving S_n squared. That seems recursive because a_n depends on S_n, which includes a_n itself. So, I think I'll need to find a way to express S_n in terms of S_{n-1} or something like that.\n\nLet me write down what I know:\n\n- a_1 = 1\n- For n \u2265 2, a_n = (2S_n^2)/(2S_n - 1)\n- S_n = S_{n-1} + a_n\n\nSo, S_n is the sum up to n, which is the sum up to n-1 plus the nth term. Since a_n is expressed in terms of S_n, which includes a_n, I can substitute the expression for a_n into the equation for S_n. Let me try that.\n\nStarting with S_n = S_{n-1} + a_n, and substituting a_n:\n\nS_n = S_{n-1} + (2S_n^2)/(2S_n - 1)\n\nHmm, okay, so now I have an equation involving S_n and S_{n-1}. Let me rearrange this equation to solve for S_n. Let's write it out:\n\nS_n = S_{n-1} + (2S_n^2)/(2S_n - 1)\n\nTo make this easier, maybe I can multiply both sides by (2S_n - 1) to eliminate the denominator. Let's try that:\n\n(2S_n - 1) * S_n = (2S_n - 1) * S_{n-1} + 2S_n^2\n\nExpanding the left side:\n\n2S_n^2 - S_n = (2S_n - 1)S_{n-1} + 2S_n^2\n\nNow, let's subtract 2S_n^2 from both sides to simplify:\n\n2S_n^2 - S_n - 2S_n^2 = (2S_n - 1)S_{n-1}\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n- S_n = (2S_n - 1)S_{n-1}\n\nHmm, that's interesting. Let's write that as:\n\n- S_n = (2S_n - 1)S_{n-1}\n\nI can rearrange this equation to solve for S_n in terms of S_{n-1}. Let's bring all terms involving S_n to one side.\n\nSo, let's distribute the right side:\n\n- S_n = 2S_n S_{n-1} - S_{n-1}\n\nNow, let's bring all terms involving S_n to the left side:\n\n- S_n - 2S_n S_{n-1} = - S_{n-1}\n\nFactor out S_n on the left:\n\nS_n (-1 - 2S_{n-1}) = - S_{n-1}\n\nMultiply both sides by -1 to make it look nicer:\n\nS_n (1 + 2S_{n-1}) = S_{n-1}\n\nNow, solve for S_n:\n\nS_n = S_{n-1} / (1 + 2S_{n-1})\n\nHmm, that's a much simpler recursive formula for S_n in terms of S_{n-1}. So, instead of dealing with a_n directly, maybe it's easier to work with S_n.\n\nGiven that, let's compute the first few S_n to see if we can find a pattern.\n\nWe know that S_1 = a_1 = 1.\n\nNow, let's compute S_2:\n\nS_2 = S_1 / (1 + 2S_1) = 1 / (1 + 2*1) = 1 / 3\n\nWait, that seems small. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, S_2 is the sum of a_1 and a_2, right? So, S_2 = a_1 + a_2 = 1 + a_2. But according to the recursive formula, S_2 = S_1 / (1 + 2S_1) = 1 / (1 + 2*1) = 1/3.\n\nBut that would mean a_2 = S_2 - S_1 = (1/3) - 1 = -2/3. That seems odd because a_2 is negative. Let me check if that's correct.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me go back to the original equation.\n\nWe had:\n\nS_n = S_{n-1} + a_n\n\nAnd a_n = (2S_n^2)/(2S_n - 1)\n\nSo, substituting into S_n:\n\nS_n = S_{n-1} + (2S_n^2)/(2S_n - 1)\n\nThen, multiplying both sides by (2S_n - 1):\n\n(2S_n - 1) S_n = (2S_n - 1) S_{n-1} + 2S_n^2\n\nWhich expands to:\n\n2S_n^2 - S_n = 2S_n S_{n-1} - S_{n-1} + 2S_n^2\n\nSubtracting 2S_n^2 from both sides:\n\n- S_n = 2S_n S_{n-1} - S_{n-1}\n\nThen, moving all S_n terms to the left:\n\n- S_n - 2S_n S_{n-1} = - S_{n-1}\n\nFactor S_n:\n\nS_n (-1 - 2S_{n-1}) = - S_{n-1}\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\nS_n (1 + 2S_{n-1}) = S_{n-1}\n\nSo, S_n = S_{n-1} / (1 + 2S_{n-1})\n\nThat seems correct. So, plugging S_1 = 1, we get S_2 = 1/(1 + 2*1) = 1/3.\n\nSo, a_2 = S_2 - S_1 = (1/3) - 1 = -2/3.\n\nHmm, okay, that's negative, but maybe that's correct. Let's proceed and see if we can find a pattern.\n\nNow, let's compute S_3:\n\nS_3 = S_2 / (1 + 2S_2) = (1/3) / (1 + 2*(1/3)) = (1/3) / (1 + 2/3) = (1/3) / (5/3) = (1/3)*(3/5) = 1/5.\n\nSo, S_3 = 1/5.\n\nThen, a_3 = S_3 - S_2 = (1/5) - (1/3) = (3/15 - 5/15) = (-2/15).\n\nWait, that's negative again. Hmm, okay.\n\nLet's do S_4:\n\nS_4 = S_3 / (1 + 2S_3) = (1/5) / (1 + 2*(1/5)) = (1/5) / (1 + 2/5) = (1/5) / (7/5) = (1/5)*(5/7) = 1/7.\n\nSo, S_4 = 1/7.\n\nThen, a_4 = S_4 - S_3 = (1/7) - (1/5) = (5/35 - 7/35) = (-2/35).\n\nHmm, I see a pattern here. Let me list out the S_n and a_n terms:\n\nn | S_n        | a_n\n---|------------|---------\n1 | 1          | 1\n2 | 1/3        | -2/3\n3 | 1/5        | -2/15\n4 | 1/7        | -2/35\n5 | 1/9        | -2/63\n...| ...        | ...\n\nWait, so S_n seems to be 1/(2n - 1). Let me check:\n\nAt n=1, S_1=1=1/(2*1 -1)=1/1=1.\n\nn=2, S_2=1/3=1/(2*2 -1)=1/3.\n\nn=3, S_3=1/5=1/(2*3 -1)=1/5.\n\nn=4, S_4=1/7=1/(2*4 -1)=1/7.\n\nSo yes, it seems that S_n = 1/(2n - 1).\n\nIf that's the case, then a_n = S_n - S_{n-1} = 1/(2n - 1) - 1/(2(n-1) - 1) = 1/(2n -1) - 1/(2n -3).\n\nLet me compute that:\n\na_n = [1/(2n -1)] - [1/(2n -3)] = [ (2n -3) - (2n -1) ] / [ (2n -1)(2n -3) ] = [ -2 ] / [ (2n -1)(2n -3) ].\n\nSo, a_n = -2 / [ (2n -1)(2n -3) ].\n\nWait, that seems to match the earlier terms:\n\nFor n=2, a_2 = -2/(3*1) = -2/3.\n\nFor n=3, a_3 = -2/(5*3) = -2/15.\n\nFor n=4, a_4 = -2/(7*5) = -2/35.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the general formula for a_n is a_n = -2 / [ (2n -1)(2n -3) ] for n \u2265 2.\n\nBut let me check this formula with n=5 to make sure.\n\nCompute S_5 using S_n = 1/(2n -1):\n\nS_5 = 1/(2*5 -1) = 1/9.\n\nThen, a_5 = S_5 - S_4 = 1/9 - 1/7 = (7 - 9)/(63) = (-2)/63.\n\nUsing the formula, a_5 = -2/(9*7) = -2/63. Correct.\n\nOkay, so now that I have a general formula for a_n, I can plug in n=100 to find a_{100}.\n\nSo, a_{100} = -2 / [ (2*100 -1)(2*100 -3) ] = -2 / [199 * 197].\n\nWait, 2*100 is 200, so 200 -1 is 199, and 200 -3 is 197.\n\nSo, a_{100} = -2 / (199 * 197).\n\nLet me compute 199 * 197. Hmm, 200*200 is 40,000, so 199*197 is (200 -1)(200 -3) = 200^2 - 3*200 -1*200 + 3 = 40,000 - 600 - 200 + 3 = 40,000 - 800 + 3 = 39,203.\n\nWait, let me check that calculation again because 199*197 is equal to (200 -1)(200 -3).\n\nUsing the formula (a - b)(a - c) = a^2 - a(b + c) + bc.\n\nSo, a=200, b=1, c=3.\n\nThus, (200)^2 - 200*(1 +3) + 1*3 = 40,000 - 200*4 + 3 = 40,000 - 800 + 3 = 39,203.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, a_{100} = -2 / 39,203.\n\nWait, but let me check: 199*197. Alternatively, 199*197 = (200 -1)(200 -3) = 200^2 - 200*(1+3) + 1*3 = 40,000 - 800 + 3 = 39,203.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nSo, a_{100} = -2 / 39,203.\n\nBut wait, let me check if that's the correct expression.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write it as a positive fraction over a positive denominator, but since a_n is negative for n \u2265 2, it's fine.\n\nWait, but let me check the calculation again because I might have made a mistake in the multiplication.\n\nWait, 199*197.\n\nLet me compute 200*197 = 39,400.\n\nThen subtract 1*197 = 197.\n\nSo, 39,400 - 197 = 39,203. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, a_{100} = -2 / 39,203.\n\nAlternatively, I can write this as -2/(199*197) = -2/(39,203).\n\nWait, but let me check if this can be simplified further. Let's see if 2 and 39,203 have any common factors.\n\nSince 39,203 is an odd number, it's not divisible by 2, so the fraction is already in its simplest form.\n\nTherefore, a_{100} = -2/39,203.\n\nWait, but let me check my earlier steps again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting from S_n = 1/(2n -1), which seems to hold for n=1,2,3,4,5, etc.\n\nThen, a_n = S_n - S_{n-1} = 1/(2n -1) - 1/(2(n-1) -1) = 1/(2n -1) - 1/(2n -3).\n\nWhich simplifies to [ (2n -3) - (2n -1) ] / [ (2n -1)(2n -3) ] = (-2)/[ (2n -1)(2n -3) ].\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, a_n = -2 / [ (2n -1)(2n -3) ] for n \u2265 2.\n\nTherefore, for n=100, a_{100} = -2 / [ (200 -1)(200 -3) ] = -2/(199*197) = -2/39,203.\n\nWait, but let me confirm this with n=2,3,4 to make sure.\n\nn=2: a_2 = -2/(3*1) = -2/3. Correct.\n\nn=3: a_3 = -2/(5*3) = -2/15. Correct.\n\nn=4: a_4 = -2/(7*5) = -2/35. Correct.\n\nSo, the formula seems to hold.\n\nThus, a_{100} = -2/39,203.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"find a_{100}\", so I think that's the answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write it as -2/(199\u00d7197) without computing the product, but perhaps the problem expects it in a simplified fractional form.\n\nWait, but 39,203 is 199\u00d7197, so it's fine to write it as -2/39,203.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write it as -2/(199\u00d7197) for a more compact form.\n\nBut I think either is acceptable, though the problem might prefer the numerical denominator.\n\nWait, but let me check if I made any mistake in the initial steps.\n\nWait, when I derived S_n = S_{n-1}/(1 + 2S_{n-1}), and then found S_n = 1/(2n -1), let me check that.\n\nAssume that S_n = 1/(2n -1), then S_{n} = S_{n-1}/(1 + 2S_{n-1}).\n\nSo, if S_{n-1} = 1/(2(n-1) -1) = 1/(2n -3), then S_n = [1/(2n -3)] / [1 + 2*(1/(2n -3))] = [1/(2n -3)] / [ (2n -3 + 2)/(2n -3) ) ] = [1/(2n -3)] / [ (2n -1)/(2n -3) ) ] = [1/(2n -3)] * [ (2n -3)/(2n -1) ) ] = 1/(2n -1).\n\nYes, that works. So, the formula for S_n is correct.\n\nTherefore, a_n = S_n - S_{n-1} = 1/(2n -1) - 1/(2n -3) = [ (2n -3) - (2n -1) ] / [ (2n -1)(2n -3) ] = (-2)/[ (2n -1)(2n -3) ].\n\nSo, a_n = -2 / [ (2n -1)(2n -3) ].\n\nTherefore, a_{100} = -2 / [ (200 -1)(200 -3) ] = -2/(199\u00d7197) = -2/39,203.\n\nI think that's correct.\n\nSo, the final answer is a_{100} = -2/39,203.\n\nWait, but let me check once more: 199\u00d7197.\n\nCompute 200\u00d7200 = 40,000.\n\nSubtract 1\u00d7200 and 3\u00d7200, but that's not the right way. Alternatively, 199\u00d7197 = (200 -1)(200 -3) = 200\u00b2 - 200\u00d7(1+3) + 1\u00d73 = 40,000 - 800 + 3 = 39,203.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nSo, I'm confident that a_{100} is -2/39,203.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of \\(a_{100}\\) is \\boxed{-\\dfrac{2}{39203}}.\n</think>\n\nGiven a sequence \\(a_1, a_2, a_3, \\ldots\\), let \\(S_n\\) denote the sum of the first \\(n\\) terms of the sequence.
