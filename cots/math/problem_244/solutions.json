What is the value of $8 \\odot 6$? Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out what 8 \u2299 6 is, where the operation \u2299 is defined as a \u2299 b = a + (3a)/(2b). Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should make sure I understand the operation. It's not a standard operation like addition or multiplication; it's something they've defined specifically. So, whenever I see a \u2299 b, it means I take the first number a, and then add to it three times a divided by twice b. That is, a \u2299 b = a + (3a)/(2b).\n\nAlright, so I need to compute 8 \u2299 6. Let me write that out using the definition they gave. So, substituting a with 8 and b with 6, the expression becomes 8 + (3*8)/(2*6). Let me compute each part step by step.\n\nFirst, compute 3*8. Well, 3 times 8 is 24. Then, compute 2*6, which is 12. So now, the expression is 8 + (24)/(12). Next, I need to compute 24 divided by 12. That's straightforward; 24 \u00f7 12 equals 2. So now, the expression simplifies to 8 + 2.\n\nAdding those together, 8 + 2 gives me 10. So, putting it all together, 8 \u2299 6 equals 10.\n\nWait, let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, starting again: a is 8, b is 6. The operation is a + (3a)/(2b). So, plugging in, that's 8 + (3*8)/(2*6). 3 times 8 is 24, 2 times 6 is 12, so 24 divided by 12 is 2. Then, 8 plus 2 is indeed 10. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nI don't think I made any calculation errors there. The steps are pretty straightforward: substitution, multiplication, division, and then addition. Each step checks out. So, I'm confident that 8 \u2299 6 equals 10.\n\nJust to make sure, let me think if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe by factoring or something else. Let's see, the expression a + (3a)/(2b) can be rewritten as a(1 + 3/(2b)). So, that would be a times (1 + 3/(2b)). Let me try that with a=8 and b=6.\n\nSo, 8 times (1 + 3/(2*6)). First, compute 2*6, which is 12. Then, 3 divided by 12 is 0.25. So, 1 + 0.25 is 1.25. Then, 8 times 1.25 is 10. Yep, same result. So that method also gives me 10. That's a good confirmation.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of it as combining the terms over a common denominator. So, a + (3a)/(2b) can be written as (2ab)/(2b) + (3a)/(2b), which combines to (2ab + 3a)/(2b). Then, factoring out an a from the numerator, it becomes a(2b + 3)/(2b). Plugging in a=8 and b=6, that's 8*(2*6 + 3)/(2*6). Let's compute that.\n\nFirst, 2*6 is 12, plus 3 is 15. So, the numerator is 8*15, which is 120. The denominator is 2*6, which is 12. So, 120 divided by 12 is 10. Again, same answer. So, that method also works and confirms the result.\n\nI think I've approached this problem from a couple of different angles, and each time I end up with 10. So, I feel pretty certain that the value of 8 \u2299 6 is 10. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I think that's the correct answer.\n\nJust to recap, the steps were:\n\n1. Substitute a=8 and b=6 into the expression a + (3a)/(2b).\n2. Compute the numerator and denominator separately: 3a = 24, 2b = 12.\n3. Divide 24 by 12 to get 2.\n4. Add that result to a (which is 8) to get 10.\n\nAlternatively, by factoring or combining terms, I still arrived at the same answer. So, yeah, 10 is the right value for 8 \u2299 6.\n\nI wonder if there's a way to represent this operation more generally or if it's a known operation. But since it's defined specifically as a \u2299 b = a + (3a)/(2b), I think that's just a custom operation for this problem. It's not something I've encountered before, so it's good that I can apply the definition directly.\n\nAnother thing I could check is if the operation is commutative or associative, but that's probably beyond the scope of this problem. Since the question only asks for 8 \u2299 6, I don't need to explore those properties here. But just out of curiosity, if I were to compute 6 \u2299 8, would it be the same? Let's see: 6 + (3*6)/(2*8). That would be 6 + 18/16, which is 6 + 1.125, which equals 7.125 or 57/8. So, no, it's not commutative, which makes sense because the operation involves both a and b in a way that swapping them changes the result.\n\nSo, yeah, operations can have different properties, and this one isn't commutative. But again, that's just extra thinking, not necessary for solving the problem at hand.\n\nI think I'm done here. I've solved the problem, checked my work using different methods, and confirmed that the answer is consistent. So, I feel confident that 8 \u2299 6 equals 10.\n</think>\n\nTo solve \\(8 \\odot 6\\) where the operation \\(\\odot\\) is defined as \\(a \\odot b = a + \\frac{3a}{2b}\\):\n\n1.
