What is the probability that Kim does not have a math test today? Express your answer as a common fraction. Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this math problem here. It says that the probability Kim has a math test today is 4/7, and I need to find the probability that she does not have a math test today. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that probabilities are related to the chances of events happening. In this case, the event is Kim having a math test. The probability given is 4/7, which means that out of 7 possible days, 4 of them she has a math test. But I need the opposite probability, right? The probability that she doesn't have a math test today.\n\nI think this is about complementary probabilities. I remember that the probability of an event not happening is equal to 1 minus the probability of it happening. So if the probability of Kim having a math test is P, then the probability of her not having it would be 1 - P.\n\nLet me write that down to make it clearer. If P(test) = 4/7, then P(no test) = 1 - 4/7. So I need to subtract 4/7 from 1.\n\nWait, how do I subtract fractions from whole numbers? I think I need to express 1 as a fraction with the same denominator as 4/7, which is 7. So 1 is the same as 7/7. Now, subtracting 4/7 from 7/7 would be 7/7 - 4/7.\n\nLet me calculate that. 7 minus 4 is 3, so it would be 3/7. So the probability that Kim does not have a math test today is 3/7.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. If the probability of having a test is 4/7, then the probability of not having it should be the remaining part of the whole probability, which is 1. So 1 - 4/7 is indeed 3/7. Yeah, that makes sense because 4/7 plus 3/7 equals 7/7, which is 1, representing all possible outcomes.\n\nI don't think I missed anything here. It seems straightforward once I remember that the probabilities of an event and its complement add up to 1. So the answer should be 3/7.\n\nJust to double-check, if I have a 4/7 chance of having a test, then the chance of not having it is the rest, which is 3/7. Yeah, that adds up correctly. So I'm confident that 3/7 is the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe probability that Kim does not have a math test today is calculated by subtracting the given probability from 1. \n\n1. Given probability of having a test: \\( \\frac{4}{7} \\).\n2. Complementary probability (not having a test): \\( 1 - \\frac{4}{7} = \\frac{3}{7} \\).\n\n**Answer:** The probability that Kim does not have a math test today is \\boxed{\\dfrac{3}{7}}.",
