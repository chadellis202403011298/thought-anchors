Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the smallest positive integer that has exactly 10 positive integer divisors. Hmm, I remember that the number of divisors a number has is related to its prime factorization. Let me think about how that works.\n\nI recall that if a number N can be expressed as a product of primes raised to their respective powers, like N = p\u2081^a * p\u2082^b * p\u2083^c * ... where p\u2081, p\u2082, p\u2083, etc., are prime numbers and a, b, c are their exponents, then the total number of divisors of N is given by (a+1)(b+1)(c+1)... So, for example, if N = 2^3 * 3^2, then the number of divisors would be (3+1)(2+1) = 4*3 = 12 divisors.\n\nIn this problem, I need a number with exactly 10 divisors. So, I need to find exponents a, b, c, etc., such that when each is increased by 1 and multiplied together, the product is 10. Let me write that down: (a+1)(b+1)(c+1)... = 10.\n\nNow, 10 can be factored in a few ways. Let me list the possible factorizations:\n\n1. 10 = 10 * 1\n2. 10 = 5 * 2\n3. 10 = 2 * 5\n4. 10 = 1 * 10\n\nWait, but since the order matters in terms of the primes we use, the smallest number would come from using the smallest primes with the highest exponents. Because smaller primes raised to higher powers contribute less to the overall size of the number compared to larger primes.\n\nSo, let me consider each factorization:\n\n1. For the first case, 10 = 10 * 1, this would correspond to a single prime raised to the 9th power because a+1 = 10, so a = 9. So N would be 2^9 = 512.\n\n2. For the second case, 10 = 5 * 2, this would correspond to two primes, one raised to the 4th power and another to the 1st power. So N would be 2^4 * 3^1 = 16 * 3 = 48.\n\n3. Alternatively, if I arrange the exponents differently, 10 = 2 * 5, which would correspond to two primes, one raised to the 1st power and another to the 4th power. So N would be 2^1 * 3^4 = 2 * 81 = 162.\n\n4. The last case, 10 = 1 * 10, would correspond to two primes, one raised to the 0th power (which is 1) and another to the 9th power. But since 2^0 is 1, this would just be 3^9, which is a much larger number, 19683, so that's definitely not the smallest.\n\nNow, comparing the results from the valid cases:\n\n- 512 (from 2^9)\n- 48 (from 2^4 * 3^1)\n- 162 (from 2^1 * 3^4)\n- 19683 (from 3^9)\n\nClearly, 48 is smaller than 162 and 512, so 48 is a candidate. But let me check if there are any other factorizations or if I missed any possibilities.\n\nWait, 10 is a relatively small number, so maybe there's another way to factor it. Let me think: 10 is 2 * 5, and those are primes, so I can't factor it further in terms of integers beyond that. So the possible ways to write 10 as a product of integers greater than 1 are the ones I listed: 10, 5*2, 2*5, and 1*10. So I think I've covered all possible cases.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me check if 48 indeed has exactly 10 divisors. Let's list them:\n\n1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 48. That's 10 divisors. Okay, that's correct.\n\nIs there a smaller number than 48 with exactly 10 divisors? Let's check the numbers below 48.\n\nFor example, 24: Its prime factorization is 2^3 * 3^1, so the number of divisors is (3+1)(1+1) = 4*2=8, which is less than 10.\n\n36: 2^2 * 3^2, so (2+1)(2+1)=9 divisors.\n\n40: 2^3 * 5^1, so (3+1)(1+1)=4*2=8.\n\n42: 2^1 * 3^1 * 7^1, so (1+1)(1+1)(1+1)=2*2*2=8.\n\n44: 2^2 * 11^1, so (2+1)(1+1)=3*2=6.\n\n45: 3^2 * 5^1, so (2+1)(1+1)=3*2=6.\n\n46: 2^1 * 23^1, so (1+1)(1+1)=2*2=4.\n\n48: As we saw, 10 divisors. So yes, 48 is the first number that has exactly 10 divisors.\n\nWait, but let me check if 36 has 9 divisors, which is correct, so the next number after 36 that has more than 9 divisors is 40, which has 8, then 42 with 8, 44 with 6, 45 with 6, 46 with 4, and then 48 with 10. So 48 is indeed the smallest number with exactly 10 divisors.\n\nWait, but let me check another possibility. What if I take three primes? For example, 10 could be expressed as 2*5, but if I have three primes, maybe 2*2*... Wait, no, 10 is 2*5, so if I have three primes, their exponents plus one would have to multiply to 10. So, for example, 10 = 2*5*1, but that would require one exponent to be 1, another to be 4, and another to be 0, which isn't possible because exponents can't be negative. So, no, I can't have three primes contributing to 10 divisors because 10 can't be factored into three integers greater than 1, except 2*5*1, but 1 would correspond to an exponent of 0, which would mean that prime isn't actually present. So, it's not possible to have a number with three distinct prime factors and exactly 10 divisors because that would require one of the exponents to be 0, which is not allowed if we're considering three primes. So, the minimal number of prime factors is two.\n\nTherefore, the smallest number with exactly 10 divisors is 48, which is 2^4 * 3^1, giving (4+1)(1+1)=5*2=10 divisors.\n</think>\n\nThe smallest positive integer with exactly 10 positive divisors is found by considering the prime factorization and the formula for the number of divisors. The number 48, which factors into 2^4 * 3^1, has exactly 10 divisors. \n\n**Answer:** The smallest positive integer with exactly 10 positive integer divisors is 48.\n\n$\\boxed{48}$",
