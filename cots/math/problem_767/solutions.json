Problem: Let $g(x)$ be a function piecewise defined as \\[g(x) = \\left\\{\n\\begin{array}{cl}\n-x & x\\le 0, \\\\\n2x-41 & x>0.\n\\end{array}\n\\right.\\] If $a$ is negative, find $a$ so that $g(g(g(10.5)))=g(g(g(a)))$. Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I need to solve this problem where I'm given a piecewise function g(x), and I need to find a negative number a such that g(g(g(10.5))) equals g(g(g(a))). Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated, but I think I can break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me write down the function g(x) to make sure I have it right. It's defined as:\n\ng(x) = {\n    -x, if x \u2264 0,\n    2x - 41, if x > 0\n}\n\nSo, g(x) is a piecewise function that behaves differently depending on whether x is non-positive or positive. If x is less than or equal to zero, g(x) is just the negative of x. If x is greater than zero, then g(x) is 2x minus 41.\n\nThe problem is asking me to find a negative number a such that when I apply g three times to 10.5, it's equal to applying g three times to a. So, I need to compute g(g(g(10.5))) and set it equal to g(g(g(a))), then solve for a, keeping in mind that a is negative.\n\nI think the approach here is to first compute g(g(g(10.5))) step by step, and then figure out what a must be so that g(g(g(a))) gives the same result. Since a is negative, I can probably use that information to determine which parts of the piecewise function to use at each step.\n\nLet me start by computing g(10.5). Since 10.5 is greater than 0, I'll use the second part of the piecewise function: 2x - 41.\n\nSo, g(10.5) = 2*(10.5) - 41. Let me compute that:\n\n2*10.5 is 21, and 21 - 41 is -20. So, g(10.5) = -20.\n\nNow, I need to compute g(g(10.5)), which is g(-20). Since -20 is less than or equal to 0, I'll use the first part of the piecewise function: -x.\n\nSo, g(-20) = -(-20) = 20. Therefore, g(g(10.5)) = 20.\n\nNext, I need to compute g(g(g(10.5))), which is g(20). Since 20 is greater than 0, I use the second part again: 2x - 41.\n\ng(20) = 2*20 - 41. 2*20 is 40, so 40 - 41 is -1. So, g(g(g(10.5))) = -1.\n\nAlright, so the result of g(g(g(10.5))) is -1. Now, I need to find a negative a such that g(g(g(a))) is also -1.\n\nSince a is negative, let's work through g(g(g(a))) step by step, keeping track of which piece of the function to use at each step.\n\nFirst, compute g(a). Since a is negative, we'll use the first part of the piecewise function: g(a) = -a. But wait, a is negative, so -a will be positive. For example, if a is -5, then g(a) would be 5.\n\nSo, g(a) = -a, which is positive because a is negative. Now, moving on to g(g(a)).\n\nSince g(a) is positive, we'll use the second part of the function again for the next application. So, g(g(a)) = 2*(g(a)) - 41.\n\nBut g(a) is -a, so substituting that in, we get g(g(a)) = 2*(-a) - 41, but wait, that's not correct because g(a) is -a, which is positive, so when we substitute, it's 2*(g(a)) - 41 = 2*(-a) - 41? Wait, no, that's not right because g(a) is -a, which is positive, so actually, it's 2*(g(a)) - 41 = 2*(-a) - 41? Hmm, maybe I should approach this more carefully.\n\nWait, let me correct that. Since g(a) is -a, which is positive because a is negative, so when we compute g(g(a)), we use the second part of the function, so it's 2*(g(a)) - 41. Since g(a) is -a, that becomes 2*(-a) - 41, which simplifies to -2a - 41.\n\nWait, that seems correct. So, g(g(a)) = 2*(g(a)) - 41 = 2*(-a) - 41 = -2a - 41.\n\nNow, moving on to g(g(g(a))), which is g applied to g(g(a)). So, g(g(g(a))) = g(-2a - 41). Now, I need to determine whether -2a - 41 is positive or negative to decide which piece of the function to use.\n\nSince a is negative, let's think about the value of -2a. If a is negative, then -2a is positive because multiplying a negative by -2 gives a positive. So, -2a is positive, and then we subtract 41. So, -2a - 41 could be either positive or negative depending on how large -2a is.\n\nWait, perhaps I should compute it more carefully. Let me denote b = g(g(a)) = -2a - 41. Now, we need to find g(b), so g(b) is:\n\nIf b \u2264 0, then g(b) = -b.\n\nIf b > 0, then g(b) = 2b - 41.\n\nSo, depending on whether b is positive or negative, we'll use one formula or the other.\n\nBut since we know that g(g(g(a))) must equal -1, which is the same as g(g(g(10.5))), let's set up the equation:\n\ng(g(g(a))) = -1.\n\nSo, g(b) = -1, where b = g(g(a)) = -2a - 41.\n\nSo, let's write that as g(b) = -1.\n\nNow, let's consider two cases based on the value of b.\n\nCase 1: b \u2264 0.\n\nIn this case, g(b) = -b. So, -b = -1 \u21d2 b = 1.\n\nBut wait, if we're in case 1, then b \u2264 0, but we just found b = 1, which is positive. That's a contradiction because if b \u2264 0, then g(b) = -b, but that would imply b = 1, which is not \u2264 0. So, this case is impossible.\n\nCase 2: b > 0.\n\nIn this case, g(b) = 2b - 41. So, 2b - 41 = -1.\n\nLet me solve for b:\n\n2b - 41 = -1\n\nAdd 41 to both sides:\n\n2b = 40\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\nb = 20.\n\nSo, in this case, b = 20, which is indeed greater than 0, so this case is valid.\n\nSo, from this, we have b = 20, where b = g(g(a)) = -2a - 41.\n\nSo, set -2a - 41 = 20.\n\nNow, solve for a:\n\n-2a - 41 = 20\n\nAdd 41 to both sides:\n\n-2a = 61\n\nDivide both sides by -2:\n\na = 61 / (-2) = -30.5.\n\nWait, so a is -30.5, which is negative, as required. So, that's the solution.\n\nWait, let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, compute g(10.5):\n\n10.5 > 0, so g(10.5) = 2*10.5 - 41 = 21 - 41 = -20. Correct.\n\nThen, g(g(10.5)) = g(-20). Since -20 \u2264 0, g(-20) = -(-20) = 20. Correct.\n\nThen, g(g(g(10.5))) = g(20). 20 > 0, so g(20) = 2*20 - 41 = 40 - 41 = -1. Correct.\n\nNow, set g(g(g(a))) = -1.\n\nCompute g(a): a is negative, so g(a) = -a, which is positive.\n\nCompute g(g(a)): since g(a) is positive, use 2x - 41, so 2*(-a) - 41 = -2a - 41. Let's denote this as b = -2a - 41.\n\nNow, compute g(b). Since b = -2a - 41, we need to determine whether b is positive or negative.\n\nIf b > 0, then g(b) = 2b - 41. We set this equal to -1:\n\n2b - 41 = -1 \u21d2 2b = 40 \u21d2 b = 20.\n\nSo, b = 20, which is positive, so that case holds.\n\nThen, since b = -2a - 41 = 20,\n\n-2a - 41 = 20 \u21d2 -2a = 61 \u21d2 a = -30.5.\n\nWait, that seems correct. Let me check if a = -30.5 satisfies the condition.\n\nCompute g(a): a = -30.5, so g(-30.5) = -(-30.5) = 30.5.\n\nThen, g(g(a)) = g(30.5). Since 30.5 > 0, g(30.5) = 2*30.5 - 41 = 61 - 41 = 20.\n\nThen, g(g(g(a))) = g(20). 20 > 0, so g(20) = 2*20 - 41 = 40 - 41 = -1. Which is equal to g(g(g(10.5))), so yes, it works.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that when I set up the equation, I considered the correct cases. I considered two cases for b, and only case 2 gave a valid solution. So, a = -30.5 is the correct answer.\n\nI think that's it. So, the negative number a is -30.5.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of \\( a \\) is \\(\\boxed{-30.5}\\).\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to find a negative number \\( a \\) such that \\( g(g(g(10.5))) = g(g(g(a))) \\).\n\nFirst, we compute \\( g(g(g(10.5))) \\):\n\n1.
