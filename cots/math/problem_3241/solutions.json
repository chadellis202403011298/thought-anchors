Problem: Let $\\triangle ABC$ be an isosceles triangle such that $BC = 30$ and $AB = AC.$ We have that $I$ is the incenter of $\\triangle ABC,$ and $IC = 18.$ What is the length of the inradius of the triangle? Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this geometry problem here. Let me read it again and try to understand what's being asked.\n\nWe have an isosceles triangle ABC where BC is 30 units long, and AB equals AC. So, ABC is an isosceles triangle with AB = AC, which means the triangle is symmetric about the altitude from A to BC. That makes sense.\n\nI is the incenter of triangle ABC. The incenter is the point where the angle bisectors of the triangle meet, and it's also the center of the incircle, which is tangent to all three sides of the triangle. The inradius is the radius of this incircle, and that's what we're trying to find.\n\nWe're given that IC, the distance from the incenter I to vertex C, is 18 units. So, our goal is to find the inradius, which is the distance from the incenter I to any of the sides of the triangle.\n\nLet me try to visualize this. Since ABC is isosceles with AB = AC, the incenter I must lie along the altitude from A to BC because of the symmetry. So, if I draw the altitude from A to BC, the incenter I will be somewhere along that altitude.\n\nLet me denote the altitude from A to BC as AD, where D is the midpoint of BC because the triangle is isosceles. So, BD = DC = 15 units each because BC is 30 units.\n\nNow, let's assign some variables. Let me let the length of AB and AC be 's'. So, AB = AC = s. Then, the base BC is 30 units, as given.\n\nSince AD is the altitude, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to express AD in terms of s. So, in triangle ABD, which is a right-angled triangle, we have:\n\nAD^2 + BD^2 = AB^2\n\nWhich translates to:\n\nAD^2 + 15^2 = s^2\n\nSo, AD^2 = s^2 - 225\n\nTherefore, AD = sqrt(s^2 - 225)\n\nNow, the inradius 'r' is the distance from the incenter I to any side, and since I lies along AD, the inradius will be the distance from I to BC, which is the same as the distance from I to AB or AC because of the symmetry.\n\nBut we're given IC = 18. So, let me try to express IC in terms of other variables. Since I is the incenter, it's located at a certain point along AD. Let me denote the distance from I to D as 'd'. So, ID = d, which means AI = AD - ID = sqrt(s^2 - 225) - d.\n\nNow, IC is the distance from I to C. Let me consider triangle IDC. Since D is the midpoint of BC, CD is 15 units, and ID is 'd' units. So, in triangle IDC, we can apply the Pythagorean theorem because ID is perpendicular to BC, so angle IDC is a right angle.\n\nSo, IC^2 = ID^2 + CD^2\n\nPlugging in the known values:\n\n18^2 = d^2 + 15^2\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n324 = d^2 + 225\n\nSubtracting 225 from both sides:\n\nd^2 = 324 - 225 = 99\n\nSo, d = sqrt(99) = 3*sqrt(11)\n\nTherefore, ID = 3*sqrt(11)\n\nBut ID is the distance from I to D, which is along AD. Now, the inradius 'r' is the distance from I to BC, which is the same as ID because ID is the segment from I to D, and D is on BC. Wait, no, actually, D is the midpoint, so the inradius would be the distance from I to BC, which is along ID, so that's exactly ID. Wait, no, because the inradius is the perpendicular distance from I to BC, which is the same as ID because ID is perpendicular to BC. So, that would mean r = ID = 3*sqrt(11). But wait, that seems too straightforward, and maybe I'm missing something because I haven't used the inradius formula yet.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again. The inradius is the distance from the incenter to any side, so yes, it's the same as ID, which is the distance from I to BC. So, if ID is 3*sqrt(11), then the inradius r is 3*sqrt(11). But let me check if that makes sense with the given information.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should approach this using the formula for the inradius in terms of the area and the semi-perimeter. The inradius r = Area / s, where s is the semi-perimeter.\n\nWait, but in this case, the semi-perimeter would be (AB + AC + BC)/2 = (s + s + 30)/2 = (2s + 30)/2 = s + 15.\n\nThe area of the triangle can be calculated as (base * height)/2 = (30 * AD)/2 = 15 * AD.\n\nSo, the area is 15 * AD, and AD is sqrt(s^2 - 225), so area = 15*sqrt(s^2 - 225).\n\nTherefore, the inradius r = Area / semi-perimeter = [15*sqrt(s^2 - 225)] / (s + 15).\n\nBut we also have that r = ID = 3*sqrt(11), from the earlier calculation. So, perhaps I can set up an equation:\n\n15*sqrt(s^2 - 225)/(s + 15) = 3*sqrt(11)\n\nLet me write that down:\n\n15*sqrt(s^2 - 225)/(s + 15) = 3*sqrt(11)\n\nSimplify this equation:\n\nDivide both sides by 3:\n\n5*sqrt(s^2 - 225)/(s + 15) = sqrt(11)\n\nMultiply both sides by (s + 15):\n\n5*sqrt(s^2 - 225) = sqrt(11)*(s + 15)\n\nNow, square both sides to eliminate the square roots:\n\n25*(s^2 - 225) = 11*(s + 15)^2\n\nExpand both sides:\n\n25s^2 - 25*225 = 11*(s^2 + 30s + 225)\n\nCalculate 25*225: 25*200=5000, 25*25=625, so total 5625.\n\nSo, left side: 25s^2 - 5625\n\nRight side: 11s^2 + 330s + 2475\n\nNow, bring all terms to one side:\n\n25s^2 - 5625 - 11s^2 - 330s - 2475 = 0\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(25s^2 - 11s^2) = 14s^2\n\n(-330s)\n\n(-5625 - 2475) = -8100\n\nSo, equation becomes:\n\n14s^2 - 330s - 8100 = 0\n\nLet me check if I did that correctly. Yes, 25s^2 - 11s^2 is 14s^2. Then, -330s, and -5625 -2475 is indeed -8100.\n\nNow, let's simplify this quadratic equation:\n\n14s^2 - 330s - 8100 = 0\n\nI can divide all terms by 2 to make it simpler:\n\n7s^2 - 165s - 4050 = 0\n\nNow, let's try to solve for s using the quadratic formula.\n\ns = [165 \u00b1 sqrt(165^2 - 4*7*(-4050))]/(2*7)\n\nCalculate discriminant D:\n\nD = 165^2 - 4*7*(-4050)\n\n165^2 = 27225\n\n4*7 = 28; 28*(-4050) = -113400\n\nSo, D = 27225 - (-113400*1) = 27225 + 113400 = 140625\n\nsqrt(140625) = 375, since 375^2 = 140625.\n\nSo, s = [165 \u00b1 375]/14\n\nNow, since s is the length of AB and AC, it must be positive. So, let's compute both possibilities.\n\nFirst, s = (165 + 375)/14 = 540/14 = 270/7 \u2248 38.57\n\nSecond, s = (165 - 375)/14 = (-210)/14 = -15, which is negative and thus invalid.\n\nSo, s = 270/7.\n\nNow, with s known, we can find AD, which is sqrt(s^2 - 225).\n\nFirst, compute s^2:\n\ns = 270/7, so s^2 = (270)^2 / (7)^2 = 72900 / 49\n\nThen, AD^2 = s^2 - 225 = (72900/49) - 225\n\nConvert 225 to a fraction over 49: 225 = 225*49/49 = 11025/49\n\nSo, AD^2 = (72900 - 11025)/49 = (61875)/49\n\nAD = sqrt(61875/49) = sqrt(61875)/7\n\nSimplify sqrt(61875):\n\n61875 = 625 * 99, because 625 * 99 = 61875\n\nSo, sqrt(625 * 99) = 25*sqrt(99) = 25*3*sqrt(11) = 75*sqrt(11)\n\nTherefore, AD = 75*sqrt(11)/7\n\nNow, earlier, we found that ID = 3*sqrt(11), so the inradius r = ID = 3*sqrt(11). But let me confirm this with the inradius formula.\n\nWe have area = 15*AD = 15*(75*sqrt(11)/7) = (1125*sqrt(11))/7\n\nSemi-perimeter = s + 15 = (270/7) + 15 = (270 + 105)/7 = 375/7\n\nThus, inradius r = Area / semi-perimeter = [(1125*sqrt(11))/7] / [375/7] = (1125*sqrt(11))/7 * 7/375 = (1125*sqrt(11))/375 = 3*sqrt(11)\n\nSo, that confirms that r = 3*sqrt(11). Therefore, the inradius is 3*sqrt(11).\n\nWait, but earlier when I tried to compute r using the inradius formula, I got r = 3*sqrt(11), which matches with ID being 3*sqrt(11). So, that seems consistent.\n\nBut let me check if I didn't make any miscalculations in the quadratic equation step.\n\nWe had:\n\n14s^2 - 330s - 8100 = 0\n\nDivide by 2: 7s^2 - 165s - 4050 = 0\n\nQuadratic formula: s = [165 \u00b1 sqrt(165^2 + 4*7*4050)]/(2*7)\n\nWait, in the discriminant calculation, I had D = 165^2 - 4*7*(-4050) = 27225 + 113400 = 140625, which is correct because 165^2 is 27225, and 4*7*4050 is 113400, but since it's minus a negative, it becomes plus.\n\nsqrt(140625) is indeed 375.\n\nSo, s = [165 + 375]/14 = 540/14 = 270/7, correct.\n\nSo, s = 270/7, which is approximately 38.57.\n\nThen, AD = sqrt(s^2 - 15^2) = sqrt((270/7)^2 - 225) = sqrt(72900/49 - 225) = sqrt(72900/49 - 11025/49) = sqrt(61875/49) = sqrt(61875)/7 = 75*sqrt(11)/7, correct.\n\nSo, area = 15 * AD = 15*(75*sqrt(11)/7) = (1125*sqrt(11))/7, correct.\n\nSemi-perimeter = (2s + 30)/2 = (2*(270/7) + 30)/2 = (540/7 + 210/7)/2 = (750/7)/2 = 375/7, correct.\n\nTherefore, r = (1125*sqrt(11)/7) / (375/7) = 3*sqrt(11), correct.\n\nWait, but let me go back to the initial approach where I thought that IC = 18 and that led me to ID = 3*sqrt(11). But when I thought about it, I was confused whether r = ID. But in reality, ID is the distance from I to D, which is along AD, but since D is on BC, the distance from I to BC is indeed ID, so that is the inradius. Therefore, r = ID = 3*sqrt(11). So, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use another approach. Since I is the incenter, the distance from I to C can be expressed in terms of the sides of the triangle and the inradius.\n\nWait, in triangle ICD, where CD = 15, ID = r, and IC = 18, so by Pythagoras, 18^2 = 15^2 + r^2, which gives r^2 = 324 - 225 = 99, so r = sqrt(99) = 3*sqrt(11). So, that's a much quicker way.\n\nWait, that's much simpler. So, in this case, since I is the inradius, the distance from I to BC is r, and since D is the midpoint, CD = 15, so triangle IDC is right-angled at D, so IC^2 = CD^2 + ID^2, which gives 18^2 = 15^2 + r^2, leading to r = sqrt(99) = 3*sqrt(11). That's much more straightforward.\n\nSo, perhaps I overcomplicated it earlier by going through the quadratic equation, but it's good that both methods lead to the same answer.\n\nSo, the inradius is 3*sqrt(11).\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe length of the inradius of the triangle is \\boxed{3\\sqrt{11}}.\n</think>\n\nWe have an isosceles triangle \\( \\triangle ABC \\) with \\( BC = 30 \\) and \\( AB = AC \\).
