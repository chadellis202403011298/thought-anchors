In a similar triangle whose perimeter is 110 cm, what is the length of the longest side, in centimeters? Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this math problem here about similar triangles. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked. The problem says: \"The lengths of the sides of a triangle are 6 cm, 7 cm, and 9 cm. In a similar triangle whose perimeter is 110 cm, what is the length of the longest side, in centimeters?\" \n\nAlright, so first, I know that similar triangles have their sides in proportion. That means the ratio of the sides of one triangle to the corresponding sides of the other triangle is the same. So if I can find that ratio, I can use it to find the sides of the larger triangle, and then specifically find the longest side.\n\nLet me start by figuring out the perimeter of the original triangle because that might help me find the scale factor needed for the similar triangle. The original triangle has sides of 6 cm, 7 cm, and 9 cm. So adding those up: 6 + 7 is 13, and 13 + 9 is 22. So the perimeter of the original triangle is 22 cm.\n\nNow, the similar triangle has a perimeter of 110 cm. Since the triangles are similar, the ratio of their perimeters will be the same as the ratio of their corresponding sides. So I can find the scale factor by dividing the perimeter of the similar triangle by the perimeter of the original triangle.\n\nLet me write that down: Scale factor (k) = Perimeter of similar triangle / Perimeter of original triangle. Plugging in the numbers, that would be 110 cm / 22 cm. Let me calculate that: 110 divided by 22 is 5. So the scale factor is 5. That means each side of the similar triangle is 5 times longer than the corresponding side of the original triangle.\n\nNow, I need to find the length of the longest side in the similar triangle. Looking back at the original triangle, the sides are 6 cm, 7 cm, and 9 cm, so the longest side is 9 cm. To find the corresponding side in the similar triangle, I just multiply 9 cm by the scale factor, which is 5.\n\nSo, 9 cm * 5 = 45 cm. That should be the length of the longest side in the similar triangle.\n\nWait, let me double-check my work to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. I calculated the perimeter of the original triangle correctly: 6 + 7 + 9 is indeed 22 cm. Then, the perimeter of the similar triangle is 110 cm, so the scale factor is 110 / 22, which is 5. Multiplying the longest side of the original triangle, 9 cm, by 5 gives me 45 cm. That seems right.\n\nI think another way to approach this could be by finding the ratio of each side individually, but since all sides are scaled by the same factor, it's more efficient to use the perimeter ratio. But just to confirm, if I were to calculate each side separately, I should get the same result for the longest side.\n\nLet's try that. The original sides are 6, 7, and 9. Multiplying each by the scale factor 5 gives me 30, 35, and 45 cm. Adding those up: 30 + 35 is 65, plus 45 is 110 cm, which matches the given perimeter. So that checks out.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident that the length of the longest side in the similar triangle is 45 cm.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe length of the longest side is \\boxed{45} centimeters.\n</think>\n\nThe lengths of the sides of a triangle are 6 cm, 7 cm, and 9 cm. To find the length of the longest side in a similar triangle with a perimeter of 110 cm, we start by calculating the perimeter of the original triangle:\n\n\\[\n6 + 7 + 9 = 22 \\text{ cm}\n\\]\n\nThe scale factor \\( k \\) for the similar triangle is the ratio of the perimeters:\n\n\\[\nk = \\frac{110 \\text{ cm}}{22 \\text{ cm}} = 5\n\\]\n\nThe longest side of the original triangle is 9 cm. Multiplying this by the scale factor gives the length of the longest side in the similar triangle:\n\n\\[\n9 \\text{ cm} \\times 5 = 45 \\text{ cm}\n\\]\n\nThus, the length of the longest side in the similar triangle is \\boxed{45} centimeters.",
