Find $\\sin B$. Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this problem here about a right triangle, BCD, with a right angle at D. They're telling me that BC is 9 units long and BD is 4 units. I need to find sin B. Hmm, right triangles, okay, so I should probably draw a diagram first to visualize this.\n\nLet me sketch triangle BCD. Since angle D is 90 degrees, that means sides BD and CD are the legs, and BC is the hypotenuse. Wait, no, actually, in a right triangle, the hypotenuse is opposite the right angle. So, if angle D is 90 degrees, then BC must be the hypotenuse, right? Because BC is opposite angle D. So, that makes sense because they gave BC as 9, which is the hypotenuse.\n\nSo, the triangle has points B, C, and D, with D being the right angle. So, BD is one leg, CD is the other leg, and BC is the hypotenuse. They've given BD as 4, so BD = 4, BC = 9, and I need to find sin B.\n\nAlright, so angle B is at point B, so in triangle BCD, angle B is between sides BD and BC. Wait, no, actually, in triangle BCD, angle B is at point B, so the sides adjacent to angle B would be BD and BC, but wait, BC is the hypotenuse, so actually, the sides adjacent to angle B are BD and BC, but BD is one leg, and BC is the hypotenuse.\n\nWait, no, that can't be. Wait, in triangle BCD, the sides are BD, CD, and BC. So, angle B is at point B, so the sides connected to angle B are BD and BC. Wait, but BC is the hypotenuse, so BD is a leg, and BC is the hypotenuse. So, angle B is between BD and BC? That doesn't sound right because BC is the hypotenuse, so the two legs would be BD and CD.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. In triangle BCD, angle D is 90 degrees, so sides BD and CD are the legs, and BC is the hypotenuse. So, point B is connected to D and C, so angle B is at point B, between BD and BC. Wait, but BC is the hypotenuse, so maybe I'm mixing up the sides.\n\nWait, perhaps I should label the triangle properly. Let me denote point D as the right angle, so the triangle is BCD with right angle at D. So, BD is one leg, CD is the other leg, and BC is the hypotenuse.\n\nSo, in triangle BCD, angle B is at point B, and angle C is at point C. So, to find sin B, I need to figure out the opposite side over the hypotenuse relative to angle B.\n\nWait, so in angle B, the opposite side would be CD, and the adjacent side would be BD, and the hypotenuse is BC. So, sin B would be opposite over hypotenuse, which is CD divided by BC.\n\nBut wait, I don't know CD yet. I only know BD is 4 and BC is 9. So, maybe I can find CD using the Pythagorean theorem.\n\nSo, in a right triangle, the sum of the squares of the legs equals the square of the hypotenuse. So, BD squared plus CD squared equals BC squared.\n\nPlugging in the numbers, BD is 4, so 4 squared is 16. BC is 9, so 9 squared is 81. So, 16 + CD squared = 81.\n\nSubtracting 16 from both sides, CD squared equals 81 - 16, which is 65. So, CD is the square root of 65.\n\nNow, sin B is opposite over hypotenuse, which in this case, the opposite side to angle B is CD, which is sqrt(65), and the hypotenuse is BC, which is 9. So, sin B is sqrt(65)/9.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, angle B is at point B, so the opposite side is CD, and the adjacent side is BD, which is 4. So, yes, sin B is CD/BC, which is sqrt(65)/9.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use another approach. Since I know BD is 4 and BC is 9, perhaps I can find the other sides or angles. Wait, but I think the approach I took is correct.\n\nWait, let me confirm the sides again. In triangle BCD, right-angled at D, so BD and CD are the legs, and BC is the hypotenuse. So, using Pythagoras, 4^2 + CD^2 = 9^2, which gives CD^2 = 81 - 16 = 65, so CD = sqrt(65). Then, sin B is opposite over hypotenuse, which is CD/BC = sqrt(65)/9.\n\nYes, that seems correct. Alternatively, I could have used trigonometric ratios, but since I don't know any angles, using Pythagoras was the right approach.\n\nWait, just to make sure, maybe I can check using another method. Alternatively, perhaps using cosine. Let me see. Cos B would be adjacent over hypotenuse, which is BD/BC = 4/9. Then, since sin^2 B + cos^2 B = 1, I can compute sin B as sqrt(1 - (4/9)^2) = sqrt(1 - 16/81) = sqrt(65/81) = sqrt(65)/9. So, that's the same answer as before. So, that confirms it.\n\nTherefore, sin B is sqrt(65)/9.\n</think>\n\nTo find sin B in right triangle BCD with angle D = 90\u00b0, BC = 9 (hypotenuse), and BD = 4 (one leg):\n\n1. **Identify the sides**:\n   - BD = 4 (adjacent to angle B)\n   - BC = 9 (hypotenuse)\n   - CD = ? (opposite to angle B)\n\n2. **Use the Pythagorean theorem** to find CD:\n   \\[\n   BD^2 + CD^2 = BC^2 \\\\\n   4^2 + CD^2 = 9^2 \\\\\n   16 + CD^2 = 81 \\\\\n   CD^2 = 81 - 16 = 65 \\\\\n   CD = \\sqrt{65}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate sin B**:\n   \\[\n   \\sin B = \\frac{\\text{opposite}}{\\text{hypotenuse}} = \\frac{CD}{BC} = \\frac{\\sqrt{65}}{9}\n   \\]\n\n**Answer**: \\boxed{\\dfrac{\\sqrt{65}}{9}}",
