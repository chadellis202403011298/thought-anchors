Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the remainder when 3 raised to the power of 1999 is divided by 13. Hmm, that seems a bit tricky at first glance, but maybe I can break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with remainders and exponents, modular arithmetic is really useful. I think Fermat's Little Theorem might come into play here. Let me recall what that theorem says. Fermat's Little Theorem states that if p is a prime number, then for any integer a not divisible by p, it holds that a^(p-1) is congruent to 1 modulo p. Since 13 is a prime number, and 3 is not divisible by 13, this theorem should apply here.\n\nSo, applying Fermat's Little Theorem, 3^(13-1) = 3^12 should be congruent to 1 modulo 13. That means 3^12 \u2261 1 mod 13. This seems useful because 1999 is a large exponent, and if I can express 1999 in terms of multiples of 12, I can simplify the problem.\n\nLet me try dividing 1999 by 12 to see how many times 12 goes into 1999 and what the remainder is. So, 12 times 166 is 1992, right? Because 12*160 = 1920, and 12*6 = 72, so 1920 + 72 = 1992. Then, 1999 minus 1992 is 7. So, 1999 = 12*166 + 7. Therefore, 3^1999 can be written as 3^(12*166 + 7), which is the same as (3^12)^166 multiplied by 3^7.\n\nSince I know from Fermat's Little Theorem that 3^12 \u2261 1 mod 13, then (3^12)^166 \u2261 1^166 mod 13, which is just 1. So, the expression simplifies to 1 * 3^7 mod 13, which is just 3^7 mod 13. So now, I just need to compute 3^7 modulo 13.\n\nWait, let me make sure I did that correctly. So, 3^1999 = 3^(12*166 + 7) = (3^12)^166 * 3^7. Since 3^12 \u2261 1 mod 13, then (1)^166 is still 1, so 1 * 3^7 is 3^7. So, yes, that seems right.\n\nNow, I need to calculate 3^7 mod 13. Let me compute 3^7 first. 3^1 is 3, 3^2 is 9, 3^3 is 27, 3^4 is 81, 3^5 is 243, 3^6 is 729, and 3^7 is 2187. Hmm, but calculating 2187 mod 13 directly might be a bit tedious. Maybe there's a smarter way to compute this without dealing with large numbers.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute each power of 3 modulo 13 step by step to simplify the calculation:\n\n- 3^1 mod 13 = 3\n- 3^2 = 9, so 3^2 mod 13 = 9\n- 3^3 = 3^2 * 3 = 9 * 3 = 27. Now, 27 mod 13. Since 13*2=26, so 27 - 26 = 1. So, 3^3 mod 13 = 1.\n- 3^4 = 3^3 * 3 = 1 * 3 = 3 mod 13\n- 3^5 = 3^4 * 3 = 3 * 3 = 9 mod 13\n- 3^6 = 3^5 * 3 = 9 * 3 = 27 mod 13 = 1\n- 3^7 = 3^6 * 3 = 1 * 3 = 3 mod 13\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, the powers of 3 modulo 13 cycle every 3 exponents: 3, 9, 1, 3, 9, 1, etc. So, the cycle length is 3. Let me confirm that:\n\n- 3^1 mod13 = 3\n- 3^2 mod13 = 9\n- 3^3 mod13 = 1\n- 3^4 mod13 = 3\n- 3^5 mod13 = 9\n- 3^6 mod13 = 1\n- 3^7 mod13 = 3\n\nYes, that's correct. So, every time the exponent increases by 3, the result cycles back. So, the cycle is 3, 9, 1, repeating every 3 exponents.\n\nSo, to find 3^7 mod13, since the cycle is every 3, we can see where 7 falls in the cycle. Let me divide 7 by 3 to find the remainder. 3*2=6, so 7-6=1. So, the remainder is 1. That means 3^7 mod13 is the same as 3^1 mod13, which is 3.\n\nWait, but earlier I saw that 3^3 mod13 is 1, so 3^3k mod13 is 1^k=1. So, 3^7 = 3^(3*2 +1) = (3^3)^2 * 3^1 = 1^2 * 3 = 3 mod13. That checks out.\n\nWait, but earlier when I computed 3^7 as 2187, and I wanted to compute 2187 mod13, maybe I should try that method as a cross-check. Let me see:\n\nCompute 2187 divided by 13. Let me do this division step by step.\n\n13*168 = 2184 because 13*100=1300, 13*70=910, so 1300+910=2210, which is too high. Let me try a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that 13*168 = 2184, as I just thought. So, 2187 - 2184 = 3. Therefore, 2187 mod13 is 3, which matches my earlier result. So, 3^7 mod13 is indeed 3.\n\nSo, putting it all together, 3^1999 mod13 = 3^7 mod13 = 3.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward, but let me just go through the steps again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\n1. I used Fermat's Little Theorem: since 13 is prime and 3 is not a multiple of 13, 3^12 \u2261 1 mod13. That's correct.\n\n2. I expressed 1999 as 12*166 +7, so 1999 = 12*166 +7. Let me check: 12*166 = 1992, and 1992 +7=1999. That's correct.\n\n3. So, 3^1999 = (3^12)^166 * 3^7. Since 3^12 \u22611 mod13, then (3^12)^166 \u22611^166 \u22611 mod13. So, 3^1999 \u22611 * 3^7 mod13.\n\n4. Then, I computed 3^7 mod13 by recognizing the cycle of 3, 9, 1 every three exponents. Since 7 divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 1, 3^7 mod13 is the same as 3^1 mod13, which is 3.\n\n5. As a cross-check, I computed 3^7 as 2187 and then found 2187 mod13, which is 3, confirming my earlier result.\n\nSo, all the steps check out, and I don't see any errors in my reasoning. Therefore, the remainder when 3^1999 is divided by 13 is 3.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe remainder when \\(3^{1999}\\) is divided by 13 is \\boxed{3}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the remainder when \\(3^{1999}\\) is divided by 13, we can use modular arithmetic and Fermat's Little Theorem.\n\n1. **Fermat's Little Theorem**: Since 13 is a prime number and 3 is not divisible by 13, we have \\(3^{12} \\equiv 1 \\mod 13\\).\n\n2. **Expressing the exponent**: We express 1999 in terms of multiples of 12. \n   \\[\n   1999 = 12 \\times 166 + 7\n   \\]\n   Thus, \\(3^{1999} = 3^{12 \\times 166 + 7} = (3^{12})^{166} \\times 3^7\\).\n\n3. **Simplifying using Fermat's Little Theorem**:\n   \\[\n   (3^{12})^{166} \\equiv 1^{166} \\equiv 1 \\mod 13\n   \\]\n   Therefore, \\(3^{1999} \\equiv 1 \\times 3^7 \\mod 13\\).\n\n4. **Calculating \\(3^7 \\mod 13\\)**:\n   - Compute powers of 3 modulo 13 step by step:\n     \\[\n     3^1 \\equiv 3 \\mod 13\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     3^2 \\equiv 9 \\mod 13\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     3^3 \\equiv 27 \\equiv 1 \\mod 13\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     3^4 \\equiv 3 \\mod 13\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     3^5 \\equiv 9 \\mod 13\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     3^6 \\equiv 1 \\mod 13\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     3^7 \\equiv 3 \\mod 13\n     \\]\n\nThus, the remainder when \\(3^{1999}\\) is divided by 13 is \\(\\boxed{3}\\).",
