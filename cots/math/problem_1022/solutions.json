Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I need to solve for m in the equation (m - 4)^3 = (1/8)^-1. Hmm, let me start by understanding each part of this equation. \n\nFirst, I know that when you have an exponent of -1, it's the same as taking the reciprocal of the number. So, (1/8)^-1 should be the reciprocal of 1/8. The reciprocal of a fraction is just flipping the numerator and the denominator, so the reciprocal of 1/8 would be 8/1, which is 8. So, that simplifies the right side of the equation to 8. Now, the equation becomes (m - 4)^3 = 8.\n\nAlright, so now I have (m - 4) raised to the power of 3 equals 8. To solve for m, I need to get rid of the exponent on the left side. Since it's a cube, I can take the cube root of both sides to undo that. The cube root of (m - 4)^3 would just be (m - 4), right? And the cube root of 8 is... let me think. 2 cubed is 8 because 2 * 2 * 2 = 8. So, the cube root of 8 is 2. \n\nSo, after taking the cube root of both sides, the equation simplifies to m - 4 = 2. Now, to solve for m, I just need to isolate it. I can do that by adding 4 to both sides of the equation. So, m - 4 + 4 = 2 + 4. That simplifies to m = 6.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. If m is 6, then (6 - 4)^3 should equal 8. Let's compute that: 6 - 4 is 2, and 2 cubed is 8. Yep, that checks out. So, the solution is correct.\n\nI don't think I missed anything here. The steps were straightforward: simplify the right side by dealing with the negative exponent, then take the cube root of both sides, and finally solve for m by adding 4. Everything seems to add up, so I'm confident that m = 6 is the right answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve for \\( m \\) in the equation \\( (m - 4)^3 = \\left(\\frac{1}{8}\\right)^{-1} \\):\n\n1.
