I need to figure out what letter should replace the question mark. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the letters given: A, D, G, J. I notice that they seem to be following a pattern, but I'm not exactly sure what kind of pattern it is. Maybe it's something like the order of the alphabet? Let me check that. \n\nA is the first letter of the alphabet, so that fits. D is the fourth letter. G is the seventh, and J is the tenth. Hmm, that doesn't seem to follow a straightforward numerical sequence like 1, 4, 7, 10 because the differences between them are 3, 3, 3. So, that's interesting. It looks like each letter is three places away from the previous one in the alphabet.\n\nLet me verify that:\n- A to D: A (1) to D (4) \u2192 difference of 3.\n- D to G: D (4) to G (7) \u2192 difference of 3.\n- G to J: G (7) to J (10) \u2192 difference of 3.\n\nYes, so the pattern here is adding 3 each time. So, if I continue this pattern, the next letter should be J (10) plus 3, which would be 13. What's the 13th letter of the alphabet? Let me count:\n1 - A\n2 - B\n3 - C\n4 - D\n5 - E\n6 - F\n7 - G\n8 - H\n9 - I\n10 - J\n11 - K\n12 - L\n13 - M\n\nSo, the 13th letter is M. That means the question mark should be replaced with M.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Maybe there's another way to look at this. Sometimes, these puzzles use a different kind of pattern, like skipping letters or using a different sequence. But in this case, adding 3 each time seems consistent and logical. I don't see any other obvious pattern here, like alternating or using a different increment. So, I think M is the correct answer.\n\nI'll double-check by writing out the sequence again:\nA, D, G, J, M.\n\nYes, each step adds 3, so it fits perfectly. I don't see any issues with this reasoning. I'm pretty confident that M is the right letter to replace the question mark.\n</think>\n\nThe letter that should replace the question mark is M because the sequence follows a pattern where each letter is three places after the previous one in the alphabet. \n\nDONE."

I need to figure out what letter should replace the question mark. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the order of the letters. They're given as A, D, G, J, and then a question mark. I wonder if there's a pattern here, like maybe each letter is moving forward in the alphabet by a certain number of places. Let me check.\n\nStarting from A: A is the first letter. Then comes D. So from A to D, that's three letters ahead: A (1), B (2), C (3), D (4). So that's a jump of 3. Next, from D to G: D (4), E (5), F (6), G (7). That's also a jump of 3. So far, so good.\n\nNow, from G to J: G (7), H (8), I (9), J (10). Again, a jump of 3. So each time, the letter is moving three places forward in the alphabet. That seems consistent.\n\nSo if the pattern continues, the next letter after J should be three places ahead. Let's see: J is the 10th letter. Adding 3 would bring us to 13. What's the 13th letter? Let me count: K is 11, L is 12, M is 13. So M.\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. A to D is +3, D to G is +3, G to J is +3. So yes, each step is adding 3. Therefore, the next letter should be M.\n\nI don't think there's another pattern here, like maybe skipping letters or something else. It seems straightforward. Each letter is just three positions ahead of the previous one. So replacing the question mark with M makes sense.\n</think>\n\nThe missing letter should be M because each previous letter is three places ahead in the alphabet, following the sequence A, D, G, J. \n\nDONE."

I need to figure out what letter should replace the question mark. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll write down the sequence as it is: A, D, G, J, ?. Hmm, I notice that these letters are all uppercase, so I don't need to worry about lowercase versions. Now, I'm trying to find a pattern or rule that connects these letters. Maybe it's something like the position in the alphabet or a shape or something else.\n\nLet me start by writing down the positions of each letter in the alphabet. A is the first letter, so position 1. D is the fourth letter, so position 4. G is the seventh letter, position 7. J is the tenth letter, position 10. So the positions are 1, 4, 7, 10, and then the question mark. \n\nLooking at these positions, I see that they are increasing by 3 each time. 1 to 4 is +3, 4 to 7 is +3, 7 to 10 is +3. So the next number should continue this pattern. If I add 3 to 10, I get 13. So the next letter should be the 13th letter of the alphabet.\n\nWait, let me make sure. The alphabet is A(1), B(2), C(3), D(4), E(5), F(6), G(7), H(8), I(9), J(10), K(11), L(12), M(13), and so on. So the 13th letter is M. That seems to fit the pattern. \n\nBut just to be thorough, I should check if there's another possible pattern. Maybe it's not about the numerical position. Could it be about the shape of the letters? Let's see: A is a triangle, D is a rectangle with a diagonal, G is a circle with a line, J is a circle with a line on the left. Hmm, not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the number of strokes needed to write each letter. A is one stroke, D is two strokes (the diagonal and the horizontal line), G is two strokes (the circle and the line), J is two strokes (the circle and the line). So the pattern would be 1, 2, 2, 2, and then... Hmm, that doesn't seem to lead anywhere clear. \n\nAnother thought: maybe it's about the letters themselves, like their names or something. But that seems too vague. \n\nBack to the numerical positions. If the pattern is adding 3 each time, then the next letter is M. That seems straightforward. I think that's the most logical answer here.\n</think>\n\nThe letter that should replace the question mark is M because the sequence follows the pattern of adding 3 to the previous position in the alphabet. A is 1, D is 4, G is 7, J is 10, so the next position is 13, which corresponds to M.\n\nDONE."

I need to figure out what letter should replace the question mark. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I notice that the letters A, D, G, J are all consonants. A is the first letter of the alphabet, D is the fourth, G is the seventh, and J is the tenth. Hmm, that's interesting. They seem to be increasing by three each time: A (1), D (4), G (7), J (10). So, the pattern here is adding 3 each time. If I continue this pattern, the next letter should be J plus 3. Let me check: J is the 10th letter, so adding 3 would take me to the 13th letter. What's the 13th letter? It's M.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Sometimes, letter sequences have other patterns, like vowels and consonants alternating or something else. Let's see: A is a vowel, D is a consonant, G is a consonant, J is a consonant. So, after A, it switches to consonants. Maybe the pattern is that after A, it's all consonants, each three apart. That would fit A, D, G, J, M.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the positions in the alphabet: A=1, D=4, G=7, J=10. The differences between them are 3 each time. So, 1, 4, 7, 10, next would be 13, which is M.\n\nI don't see any other obvious patterns here.

I need to figure out what letter should replace the question mark. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll write down the letters to visualize them better: A, D, G, J, ?. Hmm, okay. I notice that the letters are all uppercase, and they seem to be in a pattern. Let me check the order of the letters. A is the first letter, D is the second, G is the third, and J is the fourth. I'm trying to see if there's a logical progression here.\n\nLooking at the letters in order: A, D, G, J. Let's see the difference between each consecutive pair. From A to D, that's an increase of 3 (A is the 1st letter in the alphabet, D is the 4th). Then from D to G, that's an increase of 3 again (D is 4, G is 7). Next, from G to J, that's also an increase of 3 (G is 7, J is 10). So, it looks like each letter is three places ahead in the alphabet.\n\nIf I follow this pattern, the next letter after J should be three places ahead. Let me count: J is the 10th letter. Adding 3 gives me 13. What's the 13th letter? Let me recall the alphabet: A(1), B(2), C(3), D(4), E(5), F(6), G(7), H(8), I(9), J(10), K(11), L(12), M(13), N(14), O(15), P(16), Q(17), R(18), S(19), T(20), U(21), V(22), W(23), X(24), Y(25), Z(26). So, 13 is M.\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. A to D is +3, D to G is +3, G to J is +3. So, J (10) plus 3 is 13, which is M. That seems consistent.\n\nIs there another way to look at this? Maybe using the positions numerically. A is 1, D is 4, G is 7, J is 10. So, the sequence is 1, 4, 7, 10. Each time, it's adding 3. So, the next number should be 10 + 3 = 13, which again corresponds to M.\n\nAlternatively, I could think of the letters as being every third letter starting from A. So, A, then skip two (B, C), take D, skip two (E, F), take G, skip two (H, I), take J, skip two (K, L), and take M. That fits the pattern as well.\n\nI don't see any other logical pattern here. Maybe I'll consider if it's a different kind of progression, like alternating or something else, but the consistent increase of 3 each time seems the most straightforward.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the sequence is increasing by 3 each time, so after J comes M.

I need to figure out what letter should replace the question mark. Hmm, let's see. \n\nFirst, I notice that the letters are A, D, G, J. I'm trying to find a pattern here. Maybe it's something like each letter is moving down the alphabet by a certain number of places each time. Let's check that.\n\nStarting with A. A is the first letter of the alphabet, so its position is 1. The next letter is D. D is the 4th letter. So from A to D, that's a difference of 3 places. Okay, that's a good start.\n\nNext, from D to G. D is 4, G is 7. So that's also a difference of 3 places again. So far, so good. The pattern seems to be adding 3 each time.\n\nNow, from G to J. G is 7, J is 10. Again, a difference of 3. So the sequence so far is adding 3 each time.

So yeah, it's consistent. So the next one should definitely be M.\n\nIs there another possible pattern? Maybe something else like vowels or consonants? Let's see. A is a vowel, D is a consonant, G is a consonant, J is a consonant. So the pattern isn't alternating between vowels and consonants. So that's probably not it.\n\nAnother thought: sometimes letters are used in sequences based on their positions or shapes. For example, A has a triangle shape, D has a straight line, G has two lines, J has three lines. But that seems a bit more complicated, and the previous pattern seems more straightforward.\n\nSo, considering the consistent addition of 3 each time, the logical replacement for the question mark should be M.\n</think>\n\nThe letter that should replace the question mark is M because each subsequent letter in the sequence is obtained by adding 3 to the position of the previous letter in the alphabet.
