  "question": "Consider the following letter sequence: A, D, G, J, ? \nWhat letter should replace the question mark and why?",
  "answer": "The correct letter is M.\n\nStep 1: Analyze the sequence to find the pattern.\nA, D, G, J, ?\n\nStep 2: Calculate the difference between consecutive letters in the sequence:\nFrom A to D: Move forward 3 positions (A \u2192 B \u2192 C \u2192 D)\nFrom D to G: Move forward 3 positions (D \u2192 E \u2192 F \u2192 G)\nFrom G to J: Move forward 3 positions (G \u2192 H \u2192 I \u2192 J)\n\nStep 3: Identify the pattern - each letter in the sequence advances by 3 positions in the alphabet from the previous letter.\n\nStep 4: Apply the pattern to find the next letter after J:\nJ + 3 positions = J \u2192 K \u2192 L \u2192 M\n\nTherefore, M is the letter that should replace the question mark, continuing the pattern of advancing 3 positions in the alphabet."
