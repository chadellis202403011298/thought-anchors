Each week, patrons borrow 200 books and return 180 books. The library also purchases 30 new books each week and removes 10 damaged books from circulation. If this pattern continues consistently, how many books will be in the library's collection after 8 weeks? Additionally, explain what would happen to the library's collection size in the long term if these rates remain constant. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I've got this problem about a community library's book collection. Let me try to figure it out step by step. \n\nFirst, the library starts with 5,000 books. Each week, several things happen:\n\n1. **Patrons borrow 200 books.**\n2. **They return 180 books.**\n3. **The library buys 30 new books.**\n4. **It removes 10 damaged books from circulation.**\n\nI need to find out how many books will be in the library after 8 weeks. Also, I need to explain what happens in the long term.\n\nOkay, let's break this down week by week. Maybe I can model the number of books each week based on the previous week's count.\n\nLet me denote the number of books at the end of week \\( n \\) as \\( B_n \\).\n\nStarting with \\( B_0 = 5000 \\) books.\n\nEach week, the following changes occur:\n\n- **Borrowed books**: 200 are taken out.\n- **Returned books**: 180 are brought back.\n- **New books added**: 30 are purchased.\n- **Damaged books removed**: 10 are taken out.\n\nSo, the net change each week would be:\n\n\\( B_{n} = B_{n-1} - 200 + 180 + 30 - 10 \\)\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm doing this right. Borrowing and returning... So, the net effect of borrowing and returning is that the number of books in the library changes by:\n\n\\( -200 + 180 = -20 \\)\n\nThen, adding new books: +30\n\nAnd removing damaged books: -10\n\nSo overall, each week the library's collection changes by:\n\n\\( -20 + 30 - 10 = 0 \\)\n\nWait, that can't be right. If each week the net change is zero, then the number of books would stay the same every week. But that seems odd because the library is both adding and removing books. Let me check the math again.\n\nStarting with \\( B_0 = 5000 \\).\n\nAfter week 1:\n\n- Borrow 200, so 5000 - 200 = 4800\n- Return 180, so 4800 + 180 = 4980\n- Add 30, so 4980 + 30 = 5010\n- Remove 10, so 5010 - 10 = 5000\n\nOh, okay, so after week 1, it's back to 5000. So, the net change is indeed zero each week. That means the library's collection size remains the same every week.\n\nWait, but that seems counterintuitive because the library is adding 30 books and removing 10. But since 200 are borrowed each week, that's more than the 180 returned. So, the net effect is a loss of 20 books per week, but then 30 are added, and 10 are removed. So, 20 - 30 + 10? Wait, that doesn't add up.\n\nWait, let me think again. Let's model it properly.\n\nEach week:\n\n1. **Borrow 200**: Library loses 200.\n2. **Return 180**: Library gains 180.\n3. **Add 30**: Library gains 30.\n4. **Remove 10**: Library loses 10.\n\nSo, the net change is:\n\n\\( -200 + 180 + 30 - 10 = (-200 + 180) + (30 - 10) = (-20) + 20 = 0 \\)\n\nAh, so the net change is zero. So, each week, the library's collection size remains the same.\n\nThat means after 8 weeks, the number of books is still 5000.\n\nWait, but let me double-check with week 2 to be sure.\n\nStart with 5000.\n\nWeek 1:\n\n- Borrow 200 \u2192 4800\n- Return 180 \u2192 4980\n- Add 30 \u2192 5010\n- Remove 10 \u2192 5000\n\nWeek 2:\n\n- Borrow 200 \u2192 4800\n- Return 180 \u2192 4980\n- Add 30 \u2192 5010\n- Remove 10 \u2192 5000\n\nSame as week 1. So, yes, it's a cycle. The library's collection size doesn't change.\n\nSo, after 8 weeks, it's still 5000.\n\nNow, what happens in the long term? Since each week the net change is zero, the library's collection size remains constant at 5000 books.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm missing something. If the library is removing 10 damaged books each week, does that mean the total number of books is decreasing over time? Or is it a fixed number of 10 each week?\n\nIn this problem, it's specified that 10 damaged books are removed each week. So, if the library has enough damaged books to remove 10 each week, the number of books in circulation remains the same. If the number of damaged books exceeds 10, then the library might have to reduce the number further, but in this case, since the net change is zero, it's just 5000 every week.\n\nSo, in the long term, the collection size remains at 5000 books.\n</think>\n\nThe library's collection size remains constant at 5,000 books each week because the net change is zero. After 8 weeks, there will still be 5,000 books. In the long term, the collection size will remain at 5,000 books.\n\n**Answer:** After 8 weeks, the library will have 5,000 books. In the long term, the collection size will remain at 5,000 books.\n\nDONE."

Let me try to break it down step by step. \n\nFirst, the library starts with 5,000 books. Each week, a few things happen:\n\n1. **Borrowing and Returning Books**: Patrons borrow 200 books and return 180. So, net change here is 200 - 180 = 20 books borrowed each week. That means the library loses 20 books every week because they're being taken out and not returned yet.\n\n2. **Purchasing New Books**: The library buys 30 new books each week. So, that's an addition of 30 books to the collection.\n\n3. **Removing Damaged Books**: They remove 10 damaged books weekly. So, that's a subtraction of 10 books from the collection.\n\nNow, to find out how the collection changes each week, I need to calculate the net change. The net change would be the books added (30) minus the books removed (10) minus the books borrowed (20). Wait, actually, the 20 borrowed books are still out, so that's a loss. So, net change per week is 30 (new books) - 10 (damaged removed) - 20 (borrowed but not returned) = 0 books. Hmm, that can't be right because if that's the case, the collection size stays the same every week. But let me double-check.\n\nWait, no, actually, the 20 borrowed books are part of the collection until they're returned. So, the library starts with 5,000. Each week, they lose 20 books because they're borrowed, gain 30, and remove 10. So, the net change is +30 -10 -20 = 0. So, the collection size remains the same each week. Therefore, after 8 weeks, it should still be 5,000 books.\n\nBut let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Maybe I should model it week by week to see.\n\nStarting books: 5,000.\n\nWeek 1:\n- Borrow: 200\n- Return: 180\n- Net borrowed: 20 out\n- Purchase: +30\n- Remove damaged: -10\nTotal change: +30 -10 -20 = 0\nTotal books: 5,000 + 0 = 5,000\n\nWeek 2:\nSame as week 1. So, again, no change.\n\nSo, after 8 weeks, it's still 5,000.\n\nNow, in the long term, if these rates remain constant, the collection size won't change because the net change is zero each week. So, it's stable at 5,000 books.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is the net change really zero? Let me recalculate:\n\nEach week:\n- Borrow: -200\n- Return: +180\n- Purchase: +30\n- Remove: -10\n\nSo, combining these:\n\nNet change = (-200 + 180) + (30 -10) = (-20) + 20 = 0.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the collection size doesn't change over time. It remains at 5,000 books every week.\n</think>\n\nThe library's collection size remains constant at 5,000 books each week because the number of books borrowed and returned, along with those purchased and removed, balance out. Over time, this equilibrium means the collection size doesn't change.\n\n**Answer:** The library will have 5,000 books after 8 weeks. In the long term, the collection size remains constant at 5,000 books each week.\n\nDONE."

Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the library starts with 5,000 books. Each week, several things happen:\n\n1. **Borrowing and Returning Books**: Patrons borrow 200 books and return 180 books each week. So, the net change from borrowing and returning is 200 - 180 = 20 books borrowed each week.\n\n2. **Purchasing New Books**: The library buys 30 new books every week. These are added to the collection.\n\n3. **Removing Damaged Books**: The library removes 10 damaged books from circulation each week. So, the collection decreases by 10 books.\n\nNow, I need to calculate the net effect of these three factors each week. \n\nLet's compute the weekly change in the number of books:\n\n- **Books Borrowed and Returned**: 200 - 180 = 20 (net borrowed)\n- **Books Added**: +30\n- **Books Removed**: -10\n\nSo, the total weekly change is 20 + 30 - 10 = 40 books added each week.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check:\n\n- Borrowed: -200\n- Returned: +180\n- Net from borrowing: -20\n- Purchased: +30\n- Removed: -10\nTotal change: -20 +30 -10 = 0. \n\nWait, that doesn't add up. Did I make a mistake?\n\nOh, I see. The borrowing and returning affects the stock, but purchasing adds, and removing subtracts. So the correct way is:\n\nEach week, the library starts with the previous week's count, then:\n\n- Borrows 200, so it's -200.\n- Returns 180, so +180. Net effect from borrowing: -20.\n- Purchases 30, so +30.\n- Removes 10, so -10.\n\nSo total weekly change is -20 +30 -10 = 0.\n\nWait, that can't be right. If the net change is zero, the library's collection size remains the same each week. But that seems counterintuitive because they're purchasing more books than the ones being removed.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let's think again.\n\nThe library starts with 5,000 books.\n\nEach week:\n\n- **Borrowing**: 200 books are taken out. So, the library has 5,000 - 200 = 4,800 books on the shelves during the week.\n- **Returning**: 180 books come back. So, the library has 4,800 + 180 = 4,980 books.\n- **Purchasing**: 30 new books are added, so 4,980 +30 = 5,010 books.\n- **Removing Damaged Books**: 10 books are removed, so 5,010 -10 = 5,000 books.\n\nAh, so after all these weekly changes, the library returns to 5,000 books. That means the net effect is zero. So, each week, despite borrowing and removing books, the library replenishes through returns and purchases, keeping the total number the same.\n\nTherefore, after 8 weeks, the library will still have 5,000 books.\n\nBut wait, that seems surprising. Let me confirm with another approach.\n\nLet's model it mathematically.\n\nLet \\( N \\) be the number of books at the end of each week.\n\nStarting with \\( N_0 = 5000 \\).\n\nEach week:\n\n\\( N_{t+1} = N_t - 200 + 180 + 30 - 10 \\)\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\( N_{t+1} = N_t - 200 + 180 +30 -10 \\)\n\\( N_{t+1} = N_t + ( -200 + 180 +30 -10 ) \\)\n\\( N_{t+1} = N_t + ( -20 + 30 -10 ) \\)\n\\( N_{t+1} = N_t + 0 \\)\n\\( N_{t+1} = N_t \\)\n\nSo, \\( N \\) remains constant at 5000 each week.\n\nTherefore, after 8 weeks, the library will have 5,000 books.\n\nAs for the long term, if these rates remain constant, the library's collection size won't change because the net change each week is zero. So, the library will always have 5,000 books regardless of the number of weeks that pass.\n\nWait, but intuitively, purchasing 30 books each week and removing only 10 seems like the library is increasing its collection. But the borrowing and returning cancel out the growth. Let me think again.\n\nEach week:\n\n- They lose 200 books (borrowed), but gain 180 (returned). So, net loss of 20 books.\n- They add 30 new books.\n- They remove 10 books.\n\nSo, the net change is -20 +30 -10 = 0.\n\nTherefore, the collection remains the same.\n\nSo, the long-term trend is that the collection size doesn't change; it stays at 5,000 books.\n</think>\n\nThe library's collection remains at 5,000 books after each week because the net change is zero. Therefore, after 8 weeks, there will still be 5,000 books. In the long term, the collection size will remain constant at 5,000 books each week.\n\n**Answer:** After 8 weeks, the library will have 5,000 books. In the long term, the collection size will remain constant at 5,000 books each week.\n\nDONE."

Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll note down the initial number of books, which is 5,000. Now, each week, several things happen:\n\n1. **Borrowing and Returning Books**: Patrons borrow 200 books and return 180 books each week. So, the net change due to borrowing and returning is 200 - 180 = 20 books being borrowed each week.\n\n2. **Purchasing New Books**: The library buys 30 new books each week. This adds 30 books to the collection.\n\n3. **Removing Damaged Books**: The library removes 10 damaged books each week. This reduces the collection by 10 books.\n\nNow, to find the net change per week, I need to combine these three factors:\n\n- Borrowing and Returning: +20 books\n- Purchasing: +30 books\n- Removing Damaged: -10 books\n\nSo, the net change per week is 20 + 30 - 10 = 40 books. That means, every week, the library's collection increases by 40 books.\n\nSince we want to know the number of books after 8 weeks, I can calculate the net change over 8 weeks and add it to the initial number.\n\nNet change over 8 weeks = 40 books/week * 8 weeks = 320 books.\n\nTherefore, the total number of books after 8 weeks would be:\n\nInitial number of books + Net change = 5,000 + 320 = 5,320 books.\n\nNow, thinking about the long term, if these rates remain constant, the library's collection will continue to grow by 40 books each week. This steady increase means the number of books will keep rising without bound. The library would eventually have an ever-increasing number of books, which isn't sustainable and could lead to overcrowding or other issues over time.\n\nI think I've covered all the steps. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\n- Weekly Borrowing: 200\n- Weekly Returning: 180\n- Net borrowing: 20\n- Weekly Purchases: 30\n- Weekly Removal: 10\n- Net change per week: 20 + 30 - 10 = 40\n- Over 8 weeks: 40 * 8 = 320\n- Total books: 5,000 + 320 = 5,320\n\nYes, that all adds up correctly. So, the answer should be 5,320 books after 8 weeks.\n</think>\n\nAfter analyzing the weekly changes in the library's collection, we determine that each week the library's stock increases by 40 books. Over 8 weeks, this results in a total increase of 320 books. Adding this to the initial 5,000 books, the library will have 5,320 books after 8 weeks.\n\nIn the long term, with a net gain of 40 books each week, the collection will continue to grow indefinitely. This steady increase may lead to eventual overcrowding or other challenges.\n\n**Answer:** After 8 weeks, the library will have 5,320 books. If these rates continue, the collection will grow without bound, potentially causing long-term issues.\n\nDONE."

If this pattern continues consistently, how many books will be in the library's collection after 8 weeks? Additionally, explain what would happen to the library's collection size in the long term if these rates remain constant. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this problem about a community library's book collection. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to these kinds of problems, but I'll give it my best shot.\n\nFirst, let's summarize what's given:\n\n- The library starts with 5,000 books.\n- Each week:\n  - 200 books are borrowed.\n  - 180 books are returned.\n  - 30 new books are purchased.\n  - 10 damaged books are removed.\n\nThe question is asking how many books will be in the library after 8 weeks and what happens in the long term.\n\nOkay, so let's tackle the first part: finding the number of books after 8 weeks.\n\nI think the best approach is to model the change in the number of books each week and then iterate this process for 8 weeks.\n\nLet's denote the number of books at the beginning of each week as \\( B_n \\), where \\( n \\) is the week number (starting from 0 for week 0, which is the initial state).\n\nSo, at week 0, \\( B_0 = 5000 \\) books.\n\nEach week, the number of books changes based on the following:\n\n1. **Borrowing and Returning Books:**\n   - Patrons borrow 200 books.\n   - They return 180 books.\n   - So, the net change due to borrowing and returning is \\( -200 + 180 = -20 \\) books per week.\n\n2. **Adding New Books:**\n   - The library purchases 30 new books each week.\n   - This adds 30 books to the collection.\n\n3. **Removing Damaged Books:**\n   - The library removes 10 damaged books each week.\n   - This subtracts 10 books from the collection.\n\nSo, combining these, the weekly change in the number of books is:\n\\( \\Delta B = 30 (new books) - 10 (damaged books) - 20 (borrowing/returning) = 0 \\).\n\nWait a minute, that adds up to zero? So, the total number of books remains the same each week?\n\nLet me double-check that.\n\n- Borrowed: 200\n- Returned: 180\n- Net change from borrowing/returning: 200 - 180 = 20 books lost.\n\nThen, adding 30 new books and removing 10 damaged books:\n\n30 (new) - 10 (damaged) = +20 books.\n\nSo, total change per week: +20 -20 = 0.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, each week, the number of books doesn't change because the number added (30 new) equals the number removed (10 damaged) plus the 20 lost through borrowing and returning.\n\nTherefore, the total number of books remains 5,000 every week.\n\nWait, but that seems counterintuitive. I mean, they're adding 30 and removing 10, but also losing 20 through borrows. So, 30 + (-10) + (-20) = 0. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nSo, after 8 weeks, the number of books remains 5,000.\n\nNow, the second part: what happens in the long term if these rates remain constant?\n\nFrom the above, we see that each week, the number of books doesn't change. So, the library's collection size remains stable at 5,000 books per week.\n\nHmm, that's interesting. So, the library maintains a steady number of books over time because the inflow (new books) and outflow (damaged books + borrows) balance each other out.\n\nLet me just think if there's any scenario where this balance could be disrupted. For example, if the number of damaged books increases or if borrowing rates change. But according to the problem, these rates are constant, so the balance stays the same.\n\nTherefore, in the long term, the library's collection size remains constant at 5,000 books.\n\nI think that's the solution. Let me just write it out formally.\n</think>\n\nThe library's collection size remains constant at 5,000 books each week. In the long term, the collection size doesn't change because the number of books added equals the number removed plus the books lost through borrowing and returning.\n\n**Answer:** After 8 weeks, the library will have 5,000 books. In the long term, the collection size remains constant at 5,000 books each week.\n\nDONE."

Each week, patrons borrow 200 books and return 180 books. The library also purchases 30 new books each week and removes 10 damaged books from circulation. If this pattern continues consistently, how many books will be in the library's collection after 8 weeks? Additionally, explain what would happen to the library's collection size in the long term if these rates remain constant. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem about a community library's book collection. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'll start by reading the problem again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe library has 5,000 books initially. Each week, 200 books are borrowed and 180 are returned. So, that means net borrowing or loss each week is 200 - 180, which is 20 books. Hmm, so the library is losing 20 books per week from borrowing.\n\nBut wait, the library also purchases 30 new books each week. That means they're adding 30 books to their collection. So, the net change per week from borrowing and purchasing would be 30 - 20 = +10 books. So, the collection increases by 10 books each week because they're adding 30 and losing 20.\n\nAdditionally, the library removes 10 damaged books each week. So, that's another subtraction of 10 books from their collection. Therefore, combining all these, the weekly change is: +30 (new books) - 20 (borrowed and not returned) -10 (damaged books removed). So, 30 - 20 -10 = 0. Wait, that can't be right. So, that would mean no net change per week? But that doesn't make sense because I thought it was +10 earlier.\n\nWait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me think again. Each week, they start with the current number of books. Then, they add 30 new ones. Then, they lose 20 because 200 are borrowed and 180 are returned. Then, they remove 10 damaged books. So, the sequence is:\n\nStart with current number.\n\nAdd 30: current +30.\n\nSubtract 20 (borrowed): current +30 -20.\n\nSubtract 10 (damaged): current +30 -20 -10.\n\nSo, net change per week is +30 -20 -10 = 0. So, no net change each week. That means the library's collection size remains the same every week, right?\n\nBut wait, that seems counterintuitive. So, if the library is buying 30 new books, but 20 are being borrowed and not returned, and 10 are being removed, then the total is 30 -20 -10 = 0. So, the collection size doesn't change.\n\nSo, if that's the case, after 8 weeks, the library will still have 5,000 books.\n\nBut let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Maybe I should model it as a formula.\n\nLet me denote the number of books at week n as B(n). The initial number is B(0) = 5000.\n\nEach week, B(n+1) = B(n) +30 (new books) -200 (borrowed) +180 (returned) -10 (removed). Wait, no, that's not correct because when they return 180, they add them back to the collection. So, the correct formula should be:\n\nB(n+1) = B(n) +30 (new) -200 (borrowed) +180 (returned) -10 (removed).\n\nWait, but borrowed books are taken out, so they're subtracted, but returned books are added back. So, it's:\n\nB(n+1) = B(n) +30 -200 +180 -10.\n\nSimplifying that: 30 -200 +180 -10 = (30 +180) - (200 +10) = 210 -210 = 0.\n\nSo, B(n+1) = B(n) +0. Therefore, the number of books remains constant at 5,000 every week.\n\nWait, so the library's collection size doesn't change over time? That seems a bit odd, but mathematically, it checks out. Each week, the additions and subtractions balance out exactly, so the number stays the same.\n\nNow, for the second part: what happens in the long term if these rates remain constant?\n\nSince the collection size doesn't change week to week, it means the library's collection size will remain at 5,000 books indefinitely. So, in the long term, the collection size remains stable at 5,000.\n\nI think that's the conclusion here. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStart: 5000 books.\n\nAfter week 1: 5000 +30 -200 +180 -10.\n\nLet's compute that step by step:\n\n5000 +30 = 5030.\n\n5030 -200 = 4830.\n\n4830 +180 = 5010.\n\n5010 -10 = 5000.\n\nYes, that brings it back to 5000.\n\nSimilarly, week 2: same process, ends at 5000.\n\nSo, yes, it's a loop. The library's collection size remains the same each week.\n\nTherefore, after 8 weeks, it's still 5,000 books. And in the long term, the collection size stays at 5,000.\n</think>\n\nThe library's collection size remains constant at 5,000 books each week because the number of books added (30 new) equals the number lost (20 borrowed +10 damaged). After 8 weeks, the collection size is still 5,000. In the long term, the collection size remains stable at 5,000.\n\n**Answer:** After 8 weeks, the library will have 5,000 books. In the long term, the collection size will remain at 5,000 books. DONE."

Each week, patrons borrow 200 books and return 180 books. The library also purchases 30 new books each week and removes 10 damaged books from circulation. If this pattern continues consistently, how many books will be in the library's collection after 8 weeks? Additionally, explain what would happen to the library's collection size in the long term if these rates remain constant. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out how many books will be in the library's collection after 8 weeks based on the given information. Let me break down the problem step by step to understand what's happening each week.\n\nFirst, the library starts with 5,000 books. Each week, three main things happen:\n\n1. **Borrowing and Returning Books**: Patrons borrow 200 books and return 180 books. So, the net change from borrowing and returning is 200 - 180 = 20 books borrowed each week. That means the number of books in the library decreases by 20 each week because 200 are taken out and only 180 are returned.\n\n2. **Purchasing New Books**: The library buys 30 new books each week. This adds 30 books to the collection each week.\n\n3. **Removing Damaged Books**: The library removes 10 damaged books from circulation each week. This reduces the total number of books in the library by 10 each week.\n\nNow, I need to calculate the net change per week by combining these three factors.\n\nLet's compute the net change per week:\n\n- Borrowing and Returning: -20 books\n- Purchasing: +30 books\n- Removing Damaged: -10 books\n\nAdding these together: -20 + 30 - 10 = 0 books.\n\nWait, that's interesting. The net change each week is zero. So, the total number of books in the library remains the same each week?\n\nBut that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check the calculations.\n\nBorrowing: 200 out, 180 in. So, net change is -20.\n\nAdding 30 new books: +30.\n\nSubtracting 10 damaged books: -10.\n\nSo, total change: -20 + 30 -10 = 0.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the library's collection size doesn't change from week to week. It remains at 5,000 books after each week.\n\nBut wait, that feels counterintuitive. If more books are being added than are being removed, shouldn't the collection increase?\n\nHold on, let's re-examine the numbers.\n\nEach week:\n\n- Borrow: 200\n- Return: 180\n- So, net borrow: 200 - 180 = 20 books lost.\n\n- Purchase: +30\n- Remove: -10\n\nTotal change: 20 lost (from borrowing) + 30 gained (purchased) -10 lost (damaged) = 0.\n\nYes, that's accurate. So, the library is neither gaining nor losing net books each week. It's a balance between the books borrowed and returned, the new purchases, and the removal of damaged books.\n\nTherefore, after 8 weeks, the number of books remains the same as the starting number, which is 5,000.\n\nNow, regarding the long term, if these rates remain constant, the collection size won't change. It will stay at 5,000 books indefinitely because the net change is zero each week.\n\nSo, the answer is that after 8 weeks, there are still 5,000 books in the library, and in the long term, the collection size remains constant at 5,000 books.\n</think>\n\nThe library's collection size remains constant at 5,000 books each week because the net change is zero. Therefore, after 8 weeks, there are still 5,000 books. In the long term, the collection size remains unchanged.\n\n**Answer:** The library will have 5,000 books after 8 weeks. The collection size will remain at 5,000 in the long term. DONE."

Each week, patrons borrow 200 books and return 180 books. The library also purchases 30 new books each week and removes 10 damaged books from circulation. If this pattern continues consistently, how many books will be in the library's collection after 8 weeks? Additionally, explain what would happen to the library's collection size in the long term if these rates remain constant. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this problem about a community library and their book collection over time. Let me try to figure it out step by step. \n\nFirst, the library starts with 5,000 books. Each week, a few things happen: patrons borrow 200 books, return 180 books, the library buys 30 new books, and removes 10 damaged books. I need to find out how many books will be in the library after 8 weeks. Also, I have to think about what happens in the long term if these rates keep up.\n\nOkay, let's break this down. Each week, the number of books changes based on these four factors:\n\n1. Borrowed books: 200\n2. Returned books: 180\n3. Purchased books: 30\n4. Removed books: 10\n\nSo, the net change each week would be the sum of these four. Let me calculate that first.\n\nNet change per week = (Borrowed - Returned) + Purchased - Removed\nBut wait, no, actually, when you borrow, that's taking books out, which decreases the collection. Then, when you return, that's adding back. Purchased books are new additions, and removed books are taken out.\n\nSo, to find the net change, it's:\n\nNet change = (Returned + Purchased) - Borrowed - Removed\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because the library is losing the borrowed books but gaining the returned ones, plus the new purchases, minus the removed damaged ones.\n\nSo plugging in the numbers:\n\nNet change per week = (180 + 30) - 200 - 10\nLet me calculate that:\n\n180 + 30 = 210\n200 + 10 = 210\nSo, Net change = 210 - 210 = 0\n\nWait, that can't be right. If the net change is zero, the number of books remains the same each week. But that seems odd because the library is both borrowing and returning books, and also purchasing and removing some.\n\nLet me double-check. Borrowed 200, so subtract 200. Returned 180, so add 180. Purchased 30, add 30. Removed 10, subtract 10.\n\nSo:\n\nStart: 5000\n\nAfter week 1: 5000 - 200 + 180 + 30 -10\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n5000 - 200 = 4800\n4800 + 180 = 4980\n4980 + 30 = 5010\n5010 -10 = 5000\n\nOh, so after week 1, it's back to 5000. So each week, the net change is zero. That means the collection size remains the same every week. So after 8 weeks, it's still 5000 books.\n\nHmm, that's interesting. So despite all these transactions, the number of books doesn't change because the number borrowed and returned plus purchased and removed balance out.\n\nNow, thinking about the long term: If each week the net change is zero, then the collection size remains constant. So, in the long run, the library's collection size stays at 5000 books.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The library is purchasing 30 books each week, but also removing 10. So net new books added each week is 20. But at the same time, 200 books are borrowed and 180 are returned. So, the borrowed books are 200, but 180 come back, so net loss of 20 books from circulation. But the library is also purchasing 30 and removing 10, so net gain of 20 books.\n\nSo, the 20 books lost from borrowing and returned, plus the 20 added from purchases and removed, balance out. So, the total number remains the same.\n\nTherefore, in the long term, the library's collection size doesn't change; it's a steady state.\n\nSo, to answer the question: After 8 weeks, the number of books remains 5000. In the long term, the collection size remains constant at 5000 books each week.\n</think>\n\nThe library's collection size remains the same after each week because the number of books borrowed equals the number returned plus the new books purchased minus the damaged books removed. \n\nAfter 8 weeks, the library will have **5,000 books**. In the long term, the collection size will remain **5,000 books** each week.\n\nDONE."

So, the library starts with 5,000 books. Each week, several things happen: 200 books are borrowed, 180 are returned, 30 new books are added, and 10 damaged books are removed. I need to figure out how the total number of books in the library changes each week and what the collection size will be after 8 weeks.\n\nFirst, I'll note the initial number of books: 5,000.\n\nNow, each week, let's break down the changes:\n\n1. **Borrowing and Returning Books**: Patrons borrow 200 books and return 180. So, the net change from this is 200 - 180 = 20 books borrowed each week. That means the library loses 20 books each week due to borrowing.\n\n2. **Adding New Books**: The library purchases 30 new books each week. This adds 30 books to the collection.\n\n3. **Removing Damaged Books**: The library removes 10 damaged books weekly. This reduces the collection by 10 books.\n\nSo, combining these changes each week:\n\n- **Net change from borrowing/returning**: -20 books\n- **Net change from new purchases**: +30 books\n- **Net change from removing damaged books**: -10 books\n\nAdding these together: -20 + 30 - 10 = 0 books. Wait, that can't be right. If the net change is zero, the library's collection size remains the same every week?\n\nBut that seems a bit odd because even though 30 books are added and 10 are removed, 200 are borrowed and 180 are returned, which is a net loss of 20. So, why is the net change zero?\n\nLet me double-check the math:\n\n- Borrowed: 200\n- Returned: 180\n- Net borrowed: 200 - 180 = 20 borrowed (so library loses 20)\n\n- New books added: +30\n- Damaged books removed: -10\n\nSo, total change per week is: 20 borrowed (out) + 30 added + 10 removed = 20 + 30 - 10 = 40. Wait, that's different.\n\nHmm, maybe I confused the direction of the changes. Let me clarify:\n\n- Borrowing: 200 out, so library decreases by 200\n- Returning: 180 in, so library increases by 180\n- Net effect from borrowing/returning: -200 + 180 = -20\n\n- Adding new books: +30\n- Removing damaged: -10\n\nSo, total weekly change: -20 + 30 -10 = 0. So, no change in total books.\n\nWait, that makes sense because the library is replenishing the stock as it loses 20 due to borrowing but gains 30 from purchases and loses 10 due to damaged books. So, 30 -10 = +20, which cancels out the -20 from borrowing/returning.\n\nTherefore, each week, the library's total number of books remains the same.\n\nSo, after 8 weeks, the number of books remains 5,000.\n\nNow, for the long term: if the rates remain constant, the collection size will stay at 5,000 because the net change each week is zero. The inflow from new books and removal of damaged books exactly offsets the outflow from borrowing after considering the returns.\n\nSo, in the long run, the library's collection size remains stable at 5,000 books per week.\n</think>\n\nThe library's collection size remains unchanged each week because the number of books added (30) and removed (10) offsets the net loss from borrowing (20). Therefore, after 8 weeks, the library will still have 5,000 books. In the long term, the collection size will remain constant at 5,000 books.\n\n**Answer:** After 8 weeks, the library will have 5,000 books.

Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the library has 5,000 books initially. Each week, several things happen:\n\n1. **Borrowing and Returning Books**: Patrons borrow 200 books and return 180 books. So, the net change here is 200 - 180 = 20 books borrowed each week.\n\n2. **Purchasing New Books**: The library buys 30 new books each week. That adds 30 books to the collection.\n\n3. **Removing Damaged Books**: The library removes 10 damaged books each week. That subtracts 10 books from the collection.\n\nSo, each week, the net change in the number of books is the sum of these three factors: borrowing, adding new ones, and removing damaged ones.\n\nLet me calculate the weekly net change:\n\n- Borrowed: +200\n- Returned: -180\n- Net from borrowing: +20\n- Purchased: +30\n- Removed: -10\n- Overall net change per week: 20 + 30 - 10 = 40 books\n\nWait, that seems off. If borrowing is 200 and returning is 180, the net borrow is 20. Then adding 30 and removing 10, so net change is 20 + 30 - 10 = 40. So, the collection increases by 40 books each week.\n\nBut wait, is that correct? Let me double-check.\n\n- Starting books: 5,000\n\nAfter Week 1:\n\n- Borrow 200, so 5,000 - 200 = 4,800\n- Return 180, so 4,800 + 180 = 4,980\n- Add 30: 4,980 + 30 = 5,010\n- Remove 10: 5,010 - 10 = 5,000\n\nWait, that can't be right. After the first week, it's back to 5,000? That doesn't make sense because the net change should be +40, so it should be 5,040.\n\nHmm, I think I made a mistake in the order of operations. Let me correct that.\n\nThe correct order is:\n\n1. Start with the current number of books.\n2. Borrow 200, so subtract 200.\n3. Then, return 180, so add 180.\n4. Then, add 30 new books.\n5. Finally, remove 10 damaged books.\n\nSo, the sequence is:\n\nCurrent books - borrow + return + purchase - remove.\n\nSo, using this order:\n\nStarting with 5,000.\n\nAfter borrowing: 5,000 - 200 = 4,800\n\nAfter returning: 4,800 + 180 = 4,980\n\nAfter purchasing: 4,980 + 30 = 5,010\n\nAfter removing: 5,010 - 10 = 5,000\n\nWait, that brings it back to 5,000? That doesn't seem right because the net change should be +40. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the borrowing process. Perhaps the borrowing and returning happen within the same week, but the net effect is that 20 books are effectively borrowed each week.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 200 borrowed and 180 returned happen, but the 200 are borrowed from the current stock, and the 180 are returned, so the net is +20 borrowed. Then, purchasing 30 adds, and removing 10 subtracts, so net change is 20 + 30 -10 = +40.\n\nSo, each week, the number of books increases by 40.\n\nTherefore, after 8 weeks, the total increase would be 8 * 40 = 320 books.\n\nSo, starting from 5,000, after 8 weeks: 5,000 + 320 = 5,320 books.\n\nWait, but earlier when I tried to simulate week by week, it went back to 5,000, which contradicts the net change. So I must have made a mistake in the weekly simulation.\n\nLet me try again, simulating each week step by step.\n\nStarting books: 5,000\n\nWeek 1:\n\n- Borrow 200: 5,000 - 200 = 4,800\n- Return 180: 4,800 + 180 = 4,980\n- Add 30: 4,980 + 30 = 5,010\n- Remove 10: 5,010 - 10 = 5,000\n\nWait, that's back to 5,000. So according to this, the number doesn't change. But that can't be right because the net change is +40.\n\nI think the mistake is that the borrowing and returning happen during the week, and the net effect is +20 borrowed, but the purchasing and removal happen after. So, the correct sequence is:\n\nEach week:\n\n1. Borrow 200 (so -200)\n2. Return 180 (so +180)\n3. Net borrowing: -20\n4. Then, add 30 new books: +30\n5. Then, remove 10 damaged books: -10\n6. Net change: -20 +30 -10 = 0\n\nWait, that can't be. Then the number of books remains the same. But that contradicts the earlier calculation.\n\nI'm confused now. Let me clarify the process.\n\nThe problem states: \"Each week, patrons borrow 200 books and return 180 books.\" So, borrowing 200 and returning 180. So, net borrow is 20 books each week. Then, purchasing 30 and removing 10.\n\nSo, the sequence is:\n\nStart with X books.\n\nBorrow 200: X - 200\n\nReturn 180: X - 200 + 180 = X - 20\n\nAdd 30: X - 20 + 30 = X + 10\n\nRemove 10: X + 10 -10 = X\n\nSo, the net change is zero? That can't be right because the library is adding 30 and removing 10, so net gain is 20, but also borrowing 20, so net change is zero.\n\nWait, that can't be. So, the borrowing is effectively offset by the returning, and then the purchasing and removal add up to a net gain of 20, but since the borrowing is 200 and returning is 180, the net borrow is 20, which would mean the library's stock decreases by 20. Then, purchasing 30 adds, and removing 10 subtracts, so net change from purchasing and removal is +20. So overall, the net change is -20 +20 = 0.\n\nWait, that can't be. So, the library's stock remains the same each week? That seems counterintuitive.\n\nBut according to this step-by-step:\n\n- Borrow 200, so -200\n- Return 180, so net -20\n- Add 30, so net +10\n- Remove 10, so net 0\n\nSo, each week, the number of books remains the same.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense because the library is adding 30 and removing 10, which is a net gain of 20, but also borrowing 20, so overall, it's a wash.\n\nWait, perhaps the borrowing is from the current stock, but the returning happens the next week. So, the net effect is that each week, the library is effectively borrowing 20 books, which are not returned, so the stock decreases by 20. Then, adding 30 and removing 10, net gain is 20. So overall, the net change is -20 +20 = 0.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the borrowing and returning happen within the same week, so the net effect is that the library has 20 fewer books each week because 200 are borrowed and 180 are returned, but the 200 borrowed are not replaced. So, the library is losing 20 books per week due to borrowing.\n\nThen, purchasing 30 adds, and removing 10 subtracts, so net gain is 20. So, the net change is -20 +20 = 0.\n\nWait, so the library's stock remains the same each week?\n\nBut that seems odd. Let me think again.\n\nEach week:\n\n- Borrow 200: decreases by 200\n- Return 180: increases by 180\n- Net from borrowing: -20\n\nThen:\n\n- Purchase 30: +30\n- Remove 10: -10\n- Net from purchases and removals: +20\n\nSo, overall net change: -20 +20 = 0\n\nTherefore, the number of books remains the same each week.\n\nBut that can't be right because the library is adding 30 and removing 10, which is a net gain of 20, but also borrowing 20, which is a loss, so it's a wash.\n\nSo, the library's collection size doesn't change over time; it remains at 5,000 books.\n\nBut that seems contradictory because the problem asks how many books will be in the library's collection after 8 weeks, implying that the number changes.\n\nI must have misunderstood the problem.\n\nLet me read the problem again:\n\n\"A community library has 5,000 books in its collection (its stock). Each week, patrons borrow 200 books and return 180 books. The library also purchases 30 new books each week and removes 10 damaged books from circulation. If this pattern continues consistently, how many books will be in the library's collection after 8 weeks? Additionally, explain what would happen to the library's collection size in the long term if these rates remain constant.\"\n\nSo, perhaps the key is that the borrowing and returning happen each week, but the 200 borrowed are not returned yet, so the library's stock decreases by 200, but then 180 are returned, so net decrease is 20. Then, 30 are added and 10 are removed, net gain of 20. So, overall, the stock remains the same.\n\nTherefore, after 8 weeks, the number of books is still 5,000.\n\nBut that seems counterintuitive because the library is adding more books than it's removing, but also borrowing more than it's returning. So, the net effect is zero.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the borrowing and returning happen at the same time, so the 200 borrowed are not on the shelves, but 180 are returned, so net loss is 20. Then, purchasing 30 adds, removing 10 subtracts, so net gain is 20. So, the net change is zero.\n\nTherefore, the library's collection remains at 5,000 books after each week.\n\nSo, after 8 weeks, it's still 5,000.\n\nAs for the long term, since the net change is zero each week, the library's collection size remains constant at 5,000 books.\n\nBut that seems odd because the library is adding 30 and removing 10, which is a net gain of 20, but also borrowing 200 and returning 180, which is a net loss of 20. So, the two effects cancel each other out.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the collection size doesn't change over time.\n</think>\n\nThe library's collection size remains the same each week because the net change from borrowing, returning, purchasing, and removing books is zero. After 8 weeks, there will still be 5,000 books.\n\n**Answer:** The library will have 5,000 books after 8 weeks. In the long term, the collection size will remain constant at 5,000 books each week.\n\nDONE."
