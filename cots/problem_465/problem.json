  "question": "A community library has 5,000 books in its collection (its stock). Each week, patrons borrow 200 books and return 180 books. The library also purchases 30 new books each week and removes 10 damaged books from circulation. If this pattern continues consistently, how many books will be in the library's collection after 8 weeks? Additionally, explain what would happen to the library's collection size in the long term if these rates remain constant.",
  "answer": "To solve this problem, I need to analyze the various flows affecting the stock of books in the library collection.\n\nFirst, I'll identify all the flows:\n- Outflows: Books borrowed (200 per week) and books removed due to damage (10 per week)\n- Inflows: Books returned (180 per week) and new books purchased (30 per week)\n\nStep 1: Calculate the net flow per week.\nNet flow = Total Inflows - Total Outflows\nNet flow = (180 + 30) - (200 + 10)\nNet flow = 210 - 210\nNet flow = 0 books per week\n\nStep 2: Since the net flow is 0, the stock remains constant at 5,000 books.\nAfter 8 weeks, the library will still have 5,000 books in its collection.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the long-term behavior of the system.\nSince the net flow is exactly 0 (inflows perfectly balance outflows), the library's collection will remain at 5,000 books indefinitely as long as these rates stay constant. This is an example of a system in equilibrium, where the stock maintains a steady state because the inflows and outflows are perfectly balanced.\n\nIf any of these rates were to change (for example, if more books were damaged each week or if fewer books were returned), the system would move out of equilibrium and the collection size would either grow or shrink over time."
