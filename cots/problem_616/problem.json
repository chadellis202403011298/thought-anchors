  "question": "A librarian tells you: 'I have five children who are as different as day and night. The first is a thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat. The second is a comedy that makes everyone laugh. The third is a romance that pulls at your heartstrings. The fourth is a mystery full of twists and turns.' What is the fifth child like and why?",
  "answer": "The fifth child is a non-fiction or reference book. The metaphor being used is that the librarian's 'children' are actually books in different genres. The librarian has personified the books by calling them her 'children' and describing their personalities in terms of the emotional responses they evoke in readers. The first four children are clearly described as different book genres (thriller, comedy, romance, and mystery). Following this pattern, the fifth would logically be another book genre, with non-fiction being a common fifth major category in library classification systems. This problem requires recognizing the metaphorical language being used and thinking laterally to understand that 'children' in this context doesn't refer to actual human offspring but to books that the librarian cares for."
