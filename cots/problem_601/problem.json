  "question": "Alan starts at the origin (0, 0) in a coordinate plane and walks 3 units east, then 4 units north, then 8 units west, and finally 5 units south. If Alan wants to return to his starting point by taking a direct straight-line path, in which direction (in degrees, measured counterclockwise from the positive x-axis) should he walk, and how far should he go?",
  "answer": "To solve this problem, we need to track Alan's position after each movement and determine his final position.\n\n1. Starting position: (0, 0)\n2. After walking 3 units east: (3, 0)\n3. After walking 4 units north: (3, 4)\n4. After walking 8 units west: (-5, 4)\n5. After walking 5 units south: (-5, -1)\n\nSo Alan's final position is (-5, -1).\n\nTo return to the origin (0, 0), Alan needs to walk in the direction from (-5, -1) to (0, 0), which is equivalent to walking from (-5, -1) to (0, 0), or a displacement of (5, 1).\n\nThe distance he needs to walk is the length of this displacement vector, which can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem:\nDistance = \u221a(5\u00b2 + 1\u00b2) = \u221a(25 + 1) = \u221a26 \u2248 5.1 units\n\nTo find the direction in degrees, we can use the arctangent function:\n\u03b8 = arctan(y/x) = arctan(1/5) \u2248 11.31 degrees\n\nHowever, since we're moving from (-5, -1) to (0, 0), we're actually moving in the opposite direction of the vector (5, 1). In the standard convention of measuring angles counterclockwise from the positive x-axis, this would be:\n\u03b8 = 180\u00b0 + arctan(1/5) \u2248 180\u00b0 + 11.31\u00b0 \u2248 191.31\u00b0\n\nTherefore, Alan should walk approximately 5.1 units in the direction of 191.31 degrees (measured counterclockwise from the positive x-axis) to return to his starting point."
