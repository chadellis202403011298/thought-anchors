  "question": "A man lives on the 10th floor of an apartment building. Every morning, he takes the elevator down to the ground floor to go to work. When he returns in the evening, he takes the elevator to the 7th floor and then walks up the stairs for the remaining floors to his apartment. However, on rainy days or when there are other people in the elevator, he takes the elevator directly to the 10th floor. Why does he do this?",
  "answer": "The man is of short stature and cannot reach the button for the 10th floor in the elevator. He can only reach as high as the 7th floor button. On rainy days, he has his umbrella with him, which he can use to press the 10th floor button. Similarly, when other people are in the elevator, he can ask them to press the 10th floor button for him. This problem requires lateral thinking because it involves breaking away from conventional assumptions about why someone might take a partial elevator ride. Rather than assuming complex psychological or fitness-related motivations, the simple physical limitation explains the behavior pattern. The key insight comes from considering what might be different on rainy days or when others are present that would change his ability to reach his floor."
