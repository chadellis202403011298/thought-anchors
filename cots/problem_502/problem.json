  "question": "Prove the following identity using a combinatorial argument: For any positive integer n, the sum of binomial coefficients C(n,0) + C(n,1) + C(n,2) + ... + C(n,n) equals 2^n.",
  "answer": "Step 1: Understand what both sides of the equation represent combinatorially.\n\nThe left side is the sum C(n,0) + C(n,1) + C(n,2) + ... + C(n,n), where C(n,k) represents the number of ways to choose k objects from a set of n distinct objects.\n\nThe right side is 2^n, which represents the number of possible subsets of a set with n elements (including the empty set and the complete set).\n\nStep 2: Establish the combinatorial interpretation.\n\nWhen we form a subset of a set with n elements, we are essentially making a yes/no decision for each element - either it's in our subset or it's not.\n\nStep 3: Connect the combinatorial interpretations of both sides.\n\nConsider all possible subsets of a set with n elements. We can classify these subsets based on their size:\n- There are C(n,0) subsets of size 0 (just the empty set)\n- There are C(n,1) subsets of size 1 (each containing exactly one element)\n- There are C(n,2) subsets of size 2 (each containing exactly two elements)\n- And so on, until...\n- There are C(n,n) subsets of size n (just the complete set)\n\nThe total number of subsets is the sum of all these cases: C(n,0) + C(n,1) + C(n,2) + ... + C(n,n).\n\nStep 4: Apply the known result about the total number of subsets.\n\nWe know that for a set with n elements, there are 2^n possible subsets. This is because for each element, we have two choices (include it or exclude it), and we make this choice independently for all n elements, giving us 2^n possibilities.\n\nStep 5: Conclude the proof.\n\nSince both expressions count the same thing (the total number of possible subsets of a set with n elements), they must be equal.\n\nTherefore, C(n,0) + C(n,1) + C(n,2) + ... + C(n,n) = 2^n."
