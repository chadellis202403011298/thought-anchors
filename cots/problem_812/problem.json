Which of the following analogies follows the same logical relationship?\n\nA) Water is to Ocean as Sand is to Desert\nB) Hammer is to Tool as Poem is to Literature\nC) Teacher is to School as Doctor is to Hospital\nD) Page is to Book as Minute is to Hour",
  "answer": "The correct answer is B) Hammer is to Tool as Poem is to Literature.\n\nStep 1: Analyze the original analogy 'Apple is to Fruit as Oak is to Tree'.\nThe relationship here is a specific example to its general category. An apple is a specific type of fruit, and an oak is a specific type of tree.\n\nStep 2: Examine each option to find the same relationship pattern.\n\nOption A) Water is to Ocean as Sand is to Desert\nWater is a component of an ocean, not a specific type of ocean. Sand is a component of a desert. This is a part-to-whole relationship, not a specific-to-general category relationship.\n\nOption B) Hammer is to Tool as Poem is to Literature\nA hammer is a specific type of tool, and a poem is a specific type of literature. This matches our original pattern of specific example to general category.\n\nOption C) Teacher is to School as Doctor is to Hospital\nThis represents a professional working in a location relationship, not a specific-to-general category relationship.\n\nOption D) Page is to Book as Minute is to Hour\nA page is a component of a book, and a minute is a component of an hour. This is a part-to-whole relationship.\n\nTherefore, option B follows the same logical relationship as the original analogy."
