The statement is: \"Every professor teaches at least one student who is not a professor.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand the components of the statement. Let's break it down. \n\nWe have three predicates here:\n1. P(x): x is a professor.\n2. S(x): x is a student.\n3. T(x,y): x teaches y.\n\nThe statement talks about every professor, so that suggests a universal quantifier. So, I'll start with \u2200x P(x). \n\nNow, each professor is supposed to teach at least one student. So, for each professor x, there exists at least one student y such that x teaches y. That would be \u2200x P(x) \u2192 \u2203y S(y) \u2227 T(x,y). But wait, the original statement specifies that the student is not a professor. So, I need to ensure that y is a student but not a professor. \n\nSo, I need to add a condition that y is a student and y is not a professor. That translates to S(y) \u2227 \u00acP(y). Putting it all together, the statement becomes: For every professor x, there exists a student y who is not a professor such that x teaches y. \n\nTherefore, the predicate logic expression should be: \u2200x P(x) \u2192 \u2203y (S(y) \u2227 \u00acP(y) \u2227 T(x,y)). \n\nLet me double-check to make sure I haven't missed anything. The original statement says \"at least one student who is not a professor.\" So, for each professor, there must be at least one such student in their teaching set. The logic I've written captures that by stating that for every professor x, there exists a y that is a student, not a professor, and x teaches y. \n\nI think that covers it. No need for more quantifiers or variables since we're already specifying the existence within the scope of x. So, the final predicate logic should be as I've written.\n</think>\n\nThe translated predicate logic is:\n\n\u2200x P(x) \u2192 \u2203y (S(y) \u2227 \u00acP(y) \u2227 T(x,y))\n\nDONE."

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the statement is: \"Every professor teaches at least one student who is not a professor.\" \n\nOkay, so let's identify the key components here. We have professors, students, and the relationship between them where professors teach students. \n\nStarting with the quantifier, since it's saying \"every professor,\" that translates to a universal quantifier for all professors. So, for all x, if x is a professor, then something follows.\n\nNext, the main action here is that each professor teaches at least one student. So, for each professor x, there exists at least one student y such that x teaches y. \n\nBut wait, there's more.

The original statement is about professors teaching students who are not professors. So, for each professor x, there must exist a student y who is not a professor that x teaches. \n\nYes, that makes sense.

Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the statement: \"Every professor teaches at least one student who is not a professor.\" \n\nBreaking it down, we have:\n\n1. **Every professor**: This is a universal quantifier. It means that for all professors, the following statement holds true.\n   \n2. **Teaches**: This is a predicate that relates a professor to a student, indicating that the professor teaches the student.\n\n3. **At least one student who is not a professor**: This part means that within the set of students that a professor teaches, there's at least one student who is not a professor. This introduces an existential quantifier because it's saying there exists at least one such student.\n\nSo, starting with the universal quantifier for professors, I can write \u2200x P(x). This applies to every individual x who is a professor.\n\nNext, for each professor x, they teach at least one student. The predicate T(x, y) means x teaches y. So, for each professor x, there exists at least one student y such that x teaches y. That would be \u2203y T(x, y).\n\nBut wait, the statement specifies that the student is not a professor. So, we need to ensure that y is not a professor. Therefore, we need another predicate S(y) meaning y is a student, and \u00acP(y) meaning y is not a professor.\n\nPutting it all together, for each professor x, there exists a student y who is not a professor that x teaches. So, the structure would be \u2200x P(x) \u2192 \u2203y (S(y) \u2227 \u00acP(y) \u2227 T(x, y)).\n\nLet me make sure this makes sense.

So, for each professor, there exists at least one student that they teach. That translates to an existential quantifier for the student, so \u2203y, where y is a student, S(y).\n\nBut wait, it's not just any student. The student must be one who is not a professor.

It says that in a universe of discourse with all people, there are predicates P(x), S(x), and T(x,y). P(x) means x is a professor, S(x) means x is a student, and T(x,y) means x teaches y. The task is to translate the statement \"Every professor teaches at least one student who is not a professor\" into predicate logic with quantifiers.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the statement. It's a universal statement because it starts with \"Every professor.\" So, I'll probably need a universal quantifier. The statement then says that each professor teaches at least one student. So, for each professor, there's at least one student they teach. Moreover, this student is not a professor, so it's a student who is not a professor.\n\nLet me break it down. The main subject here is professors. So, the universal quantifier will apply to all professors. Let's denote professors as x. So, \u2200x P(x) would mean \"For all professors x.\"\n\nNow, for each professor x, the statement says that x teaches at least one student who is not a professor. So, for each x that is a professor, there exists at least one student y such that x teaches y, and y is not a professor. \n\nIn predicate logic terms, this would translate to: For all x, if x is a professor, then there exists a y such that y is a student, and x teaches y, and y is not a professor. \n\nPutting it together, it would be: \u2200x (P(x) \u2192 \u2203y (S(y) \u2227 \u00acP(y) \u2227 T(x,y))). \n\nWait, does that make sense?

That seems to capture the original statement accurately.\n\nI should also consider if there are any nuances. The original statement says \"at least one,\" which in logic translates to the existential quantifier (there exists). So, using \u2203y is appropriate here.\n\nAnother thing to note is the order of quantifiers. Since we're dealing with professors first and then students, the order is correct as \u2200x followed by \u2203y.\n\nIs there a more precise way to write this? Well, in predicate logic, the structure is correct. The implication P(x) \u2192 (there exists y such that S(y), and \u00acP(y), and T(x,y)).\n\nI think that's it. So, the final predicate logic statement should be: For all x, if x is a professor, then there exists a y such that y is a student, y is not a professor, and x teaches y.\n\nJust to make sure, I'll think about it in English again. \"Every professor teaches at least one student who isn't a professor.\" Yes, that's exactly what the logic statement is saying.\n\nI don't see any issues with this translation.

The statement is: \"Every professor teaches at least one student who is not a professor.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that in predicate logic, we use quantifiers like \u2200 and \u2203 to express \"for all\" and \"there exists.\" The original statement is a universal statement, so I'll probably need a universal quantifier.\n\nThe subject here is \"every professor.\" So, for every professor x, I need to say something about them.

The structure should be \u2200x (P(x) \u2192 \u2203y (\u00acS(y) \u2227 T(x, y))).\n\nHold on, I think I might have mixed up the order.

So, the correct structure is \u2200x P(x) \u2192 \u2203y (\u00acS(y) \u2227 T(x, y)).

If I have \u2200x (P(x) \u2192 \u2203y (\u00acS(y) \u2227 T(x, y))), that means for every professor x, there exists a y such that y is not a student (wait, no, S(y) is \"y is a student,\" so \u00acS(y) means y is not a student. Wait, that's not right. Because the statement says \"a student who is not a professor,\" which is a student (so S(y) is true) but not a professor (so \u00acP(y) would be the correct negation). Oh, I see, I made a mistake earlier. It should be \u2203y (S(y) \u2227 \u00acP(y)) instead of \u00acS(y). So the correct predicate logic would be \u2200x P(x) \u2192 \u2203y (S(y) \u2227 \u00acP(y) \u2227 T(x, y)).\n\nWait, but the original statement is about a student who is not a professor.

But actually, the original statement is about a student who is not a professor, so it's \u2203y (\u00acP(y) \u2227 S(y)). However, since the statement is about a student who is not a professor, the correct way is to have the student y such that y is a student and y is not a professor.\n\nBut wait, the statement is \"teaches at least one student who is not a professor,\" so for each professor x, there exists a y such that y is a student and y is not a professor.

But in predicate logic, implications can be written using the arrow (\u2192) or using the logical biconditional. However, in this case, since we're dealing with quantifiers, the correct way is to have \u2200x P(x) \u2192 \u2203y (S(y) \u2227 \u00acP(y)).\n\nBut wait, another way to express this is using the quantifiers directly. Since the statement is about every professor teaching at least one such student, it's \u2200x P(x) \u2227 \u2203y (T(x,y) \u2227 \u00acP(y)). But actually, the correct structure is \u2200x P(x) \u2192 \u2203y (T(x,y) \u2227 \u00acP(y)).\n\nHowever, I think the correct way is to have \u2200x P(x) \u2192 \u2203y (T(x,y) \u2227 \u00acS(y)), but no, that's not right because S(y) is for students, and the student is not a professor, so it's \u00acP(y). So, it should be \u2200x P(x) \u2192 \u2203y (T(x,y) \u2227 \u00acP(y)).\n\nBut in the solution provided, it's \u2200x P(x) \u2192 \u2203y (S(y) \u2227 \u00acP(y)). Wait, that doesn't seem right because S(y) is about being a student, but the statement is about a student who is not a professor. So, it's correct to have S(y) \u2227 \u00acP(y), but in the solution, it's written as S(y) \u2227 \u00acP(y), which is correct. So, the solution is correct.\n\nWait, no, the solution is \u2200x P(x) \u2192 \u2203y (S(y) \u2227 \u00acP(y)). That is correct because it's saying for every professor x, there exists a y who is a student and not a professor.\n\nAlternatively, another way to write it is \u2200x P(x) \u2227 \u2203y (S(y) \u2227 \u00acP(y)), but that's not correct because the existence doesn't depend on x. So, the correct way is \u2200x P(x) \u2192 \u2203y (S(y) \u2227 \u00acP(y)).\n\nSo, in conclusion, the correct predicate logic translation is \u2200x P(x) \u2192 \u2203y (S(y) \u2227 \u00acP(y)).\n</think>\n\nThe correct translation into predicate logic is:\n\n\u2200x P(x) \u2192 \u2203y (S(y) \u2227 \u00acP(y)).\n\nThis reads as: For every professor x, there exists a student y who is not a professor.\n\nDONE."
