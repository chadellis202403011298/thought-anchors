  "question": "You are in a room with only two items: a ladder and a light bulb that needs to be installed in the ceiling fixture. The ceiling is quite high. However, the ladder is broken and cannot support your weight. How can you install the light bulb without leaving the room to get additional tools or materials?",
  "answer": "The key to solving this problem is to overcome functional fixedness\u2014the tendency to see objects only in their traditional use.\n\n1. First, recognize that although the ladder cannot support your weight as a climbing tool, it can still serve other functions.\n\n2. Consider what you need: a way to reach the ceiling fixture without climbing.\n\n3. Solution: Lay the ladder flat on the floor directly under the ceiling fixture. Stand on the floor (not on the ladder) and use the ladder as an extension tool. Hold the ladder vertically by its sides and use the top of the ladder to carefully screw in the light bulb.\n\n4. The ladder becomes a reaching tool rather than a climbing tool, allowing you to extend your reach to the ceiling without putting weight on the broken ladder.\n\nThis solution demonstrates overcoming functional fixedness by reimagining the ladder not as something to climb on, but as an extension tool that enhances your reach while keeping your feet safely on the ground."
