The vertices of the triangle are at points A(0,0), B(4,0), and C(2,3). The gardener wants to place a small fountain at the centroid of the triangle. At what coordinates should the fountain be placed? Additionally, what is the area of the triangular flower bed in square meters? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this problem about a gardener planning a triangular flower bed. The vertices of the triangle are given as points A(0,0), B(4,0), and C(2,3). The gardener wants to place a small fountain at the centroid of the triangle, and I need to figure out the coordinates where the fountain should go. Additionally, I need to find the area of the triangular flower bed in square meters. \n\nOkay, first, let me recall what a centroid is in a triangle. From what I remember, the centroid is the intersection point of the medians of the triangle. A median is a line segment joining a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side. The centroid divides each median into two parts, with the portion connecting the vertex to the centroid being twice as long as the portion connecting the centroid to the midpoint. So, the centroid is essentially the average of the coordinates of the three vertices.\n\nHmm, that sounds useful. So, if I can find the average of the x-coordinates and the average of the y-coordinates of the three points, that should give me the centroid's coordinates. Let me write that down.\n\nFor point A, the coordinates are (0,0). For point B, they are (4,0), and for point C, they are (2,3). So, to find the centroid's x-coordinate, I need to add up all the x-coordinates of the three points and divide by 3. Similarly, for the y-coordinate, I'll add up all the y-coordinates and divide by 3.\n\nSo, the formula for the centroid (Gx, Gy) is:\n\nGx = (Ax + Bx + Cx) / 3\n\nGy = (Ay + By + Cy) / 3\n\nLet me plug in the numbers:\n\nGx = (0 + 4 + 2) / 3 = (6) / 3 = 2\n\nGy = (0 + 0 + 3) / 3 = (3) / 3 = 1\n\nSo, the centroid should be at (2,1). That seems straightforward.\n\nNow, moving on to finding the area of the triangular flower bed. I think there are a couple of ways to calculate the area of a triangle when you know the coordinates of its vertices. One method is using the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * |(x1(y2 - y3) + x2(y3 - y1) + x3(y1 - y2))|\n\nAlternatively, since the triangle is defined by points on a coordinate system, I could also use the base and height method. Let me see which method would be easier here.\n\nLooking at the points, A is at (0,0), B is at (4,0), and C is at (2,3). If I plot these points, A and B lie on the x-axis, so the distance between A and B is the base of the triangle. The height would be the vertical distance from point C to the base AB.\n\nFirst, let me find the length of the base AB. Since A is at (0,0) and B is at (4,0), the distance between them is simply the difference in the x-coordinates because the y-coordinates are the same.\n\nDistance AB = |4 - 0| = 4 meters.\n\nNow, the height is the vertical distance from point C to the base AB. Since AB is on the x-axis, the y-coordinate of point C will give me the height.\n\nHeight = y-coordinate of C = 3 meters.\n\nWait, is that correct? Because point C is at (2,3), so its y-coordinate is 3, which is above the x-axis where AB lies. So, yes, the height is indeed 3 meters.\n\nTherefore, using the base and height, the area would be:\n\nArea = (1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * 4 * 3 = 6 square meters.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the formula with coordinates to verify. Let me apply that as well.\n\nUsing the formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) * |x1(y2 - y3) + x2(y3 - y1) + x3(y1 - y2)|\n\nPlugging in the coordinates:\n\nx1 = 0, y1 = 0\n\nx2 = 4, y2 = 0\n\nx3 = 2, y3 = 3\n\nSo,\n\nArea = (1/2) * |0*(0 - 3) + 4*(3 - 0) + 2*(0 - 0)|\n\nSimplify each term:\n\nFirst term: 0*(0 - 3) = 0\n\nSecond term: 4*(3 - 0) = 4*3 = 12\n\nThird term: 2*(0 - 0) = 0\n\nSo, adding them up: 0 + 12 + 0 = 12\n\nTake the absolute value: |12| = 12\n\nMultiply by 1/2: (1/2)*12 = 6\n\nSo, the area is indeed 6 square meters. That matches my previous calculation, which is reassuring.\n\nWait a second, just to be thorough, is there another way to calculate the area? Maybe using vectors or determinants?\n\nYes, another method is to use the shoelace formula, which is essentially the same as the formula I just used. It's a way to calculate the area when you have coordinates of the vertices. It works by taking the coordinates in order, multiplying them in a crisscross fashion, and then taking half the absolute difference.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nShoelace formula:\n\nArea = (1/2)|sum from i=1 to n of (xi*yi+1 - xi+1*yi)|\n\nWhere the vertices are listed in order, and the last vertex is connected back to the first.\n\nSo, let's list the coordinates in order: A(0,0), B(4,0), C(2,3), and back to A(0,0).\n\nCalculating the terms:\n\nFirst pair: A to B: (0,0) and (4,0)\n\nTerm: x_A*y_B - x_B*y_A = 0*0 - 4*0 = 0 - 0 = 0\n\nSecond pair: B to C: (4,0) and (2,3)\n\nTerm: 4*3 - 2*0 = 12 - 0 = 12\n\nThird pair: C to A: (2,3) and (0,0)\n\nTerm: 2*0 - 0*3 = 0 - 0 = 0\n\nAdding these up: 0 + 12 + 0 = 12\n\nTake the absolute value and multiply by 1/2: (1/2)*|12| = 6\n\nSo, again, the area is 6 square meters. That's consistent across all methods I've tried so far.\n\nIs there a way to use vectors to compute this? Let me think.\n\nYes, if I consider vectors AB and AC, the area is (1/2)*|AB \u00d7 AC|, where \u00d7 denotes the cross product.\n\nFirst, vector AB is from A to B: (4 - 0, 0 - 0) = (4, 0)\n\nVector AC is from A to C: (2 - 0, 3 - 0) = (2, 3)\n\nThe cross product in 2D is scalar and is calculated as AB_x * AC_y - AB_y * AC_x\n\nSo, AB_x = 4, AC_y = 3, AB_y = 0, AC_x = 2\n\nCross product = 4*3 - 0*2 = 12 - 0 = 12\n\nArea = (1/2)*|12| = 6\n\nAgain, same result. So, no matter which method I use, the area is 6 square meters. That gives me confidence that I'm correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could also compute the area using base and height, but I think I already did that.\n\nWait, let me visualize the triangle to ensure that the height is indeed 3 meters. Points A and B are on the x-axis, 4 meters apart. Point C is at (2,3), which is directly above the midpoint of AB. Wait, is that true?\n\nThe midpoint of AB is at ((0 + 4)/2, (0 + 0)/2) = (2,0). So, point C is at (2,3), which is 3 meters above the midpoint. So, yes, the height is indeed 3 meters.\n\nTherefore, the area is (1/2)*base*height = (1/2)*4*3 = 6 square meters.\n\nOkay, so all methods lead me to the same conclusion. The area is 6 square meters.\n\nNow, regarding the placement of the fountain at the centroid. As I calculated earlier, the centroid is at (2,1). So, the fountain should be placed at (2,1).\n\nJust to recap:\n\n- Centroid coordinates: (2,1)\n- Area of the triangle: 6 square meters\n\nI think that's all the information required for the problem. I don't see any steps missing or miscalculations. All the methods I used to find the area gave me the same result, so I'm confident that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe fountain should be placed at coordinates \\boxed{(2,1)}, and the area of the triangular flower bed is \\boxed{6} square meters.\nDONE.\n</think>\n\nTo find the coordinates of the centroid of the triangle with vertices A(0,0), B(4,0), and C(2,3), we use the formula for the centroid (Gx, Gy):\n\n\\[\nGx = \\frac{Ax + Bx + Cx}{3}, \\quad Gy = \\frac{Ay + By + Cy}{3}\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the coordinates:\n\n\\[\nGx = \\frac{0 + 4 + 2}{3} = \\frac{6}{3} = 2\n\\]\n\\[\nGy = \\frac{0 + 0 + 3}{3} = \\frac{3}{3} = 1\n\\]\n\nThus, the centroid is at (2, 1).\n\nTo find the area of the triangular flower bed, we use the base and height method. The base AB is 4 meters (distance between A(0,0) and B(4,0)). The height is the y-coordinate of point C, which is 3 meters.\n\nThe area is calculated as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 4 \\times 3 = 6 \\text{ square meters}\n\\]\n\nWe verified this result using the shoelace formula and the cross product method, both of which confirmed the area is 6 square meters.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe fountain should be placed at coordinates \\boxed{(2,1)}, and the area of the triangular flower bed is \\boxed{6} square meters.\n\nDONE."

A median is a line segment from a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side. The centroid is also the average of the coordinates of the three vertices. That seems like a key point here. So, I can find the centroid by averaging the x-coordinates and the y-coordinates separately.\n\nLet me write down the coordinates of the vertices:\n\n- Point A: (0, 0)\n- Point B: (4, 0)\n- Point C: (2, 3)\n\nTo find the centroid (G), I'll calculate the average of the x-coordinates and the average of the y-coordinates.\n\nFor the x-coordinate of the centroid:\nGx = (Ax + Bx + Cx) / 3\nGx = (0 + 4 + 2) / 3\nGx = 6 / 3\nGx = 2\n\nFor the y-coordinate of the centroid:\nGy = (Ay + By + Cy) / 3\nGy = (0 + 0 + 3) / 3\nGy = 3 / 3\nGy = 1\n\nSo, the centroid G is at (2, 1). That should be where the fountain is placed.\n\nNow, moving on to the area of the triangular flower bed. I recall that the area of a triangle given its vertices can be found using the shoelace formula. The formula is:\n\nArea = |(x\u2081(y\u2082 - y\u2083) + x\u2082(y\u2083 - y\u2081) + x\u2083(y\u2081 - y\u2082)) / 2|\n\nLet me plug in the coordinates into this formula.\n\nPlugging in the points A(0,0), B(4,0), and C(2,3):\n\nArea = |(0*(0 - 3) + 4*(3 - 0) + 2*(0 - 0)) / 2|\n= |(0 + 12 + 0) / 2|\n= |12 / 2|\n= |6|\n= 6\n\nSo, the area of the triangle is 6 square meters.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. Maybe I should try another method to confirm the area. Another way to calculate the area is using the base and height. Let me see if I can find the base and the corresponding height.\n\nLooking at points A and B, they are at (0,0) and (4,0). So, the distance between A and B is 4 meters. That can be considered as the base of the triangle.\n\nNow, I need the height corresponding to this base. The height is the perpendicular distance from point C to the base AB. Since AB lies on the x-axis, the y-coordinate of point C will be the height. Point C is at (2,3), so the height is 3 meters.\n\nUsing the formula for the area of a triangle:\nArea = (base * height) / 2\n= (4 * 3) / 2\n= 12 / 2\n= 6\n\nOkay, that matches my previous calculation. So, the area is indeed 6 square meters.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll try using vectors or the determinant method. The area can also be calculated using the determinant formula:\n\nArea = (1/2) | (B - A) \u00d7 (C - A) |\n\nWhere \"\u00d7\" denotes the cross product in two dimensions, which gives the magnitude of the vector perpendicular to the plane.\n\nCalculating vectors AB and AC:\n\nVector AB = B - A = (4,0) - (0,0) = (4,0)\nVector AC = C - A = (2,3) - (0,0) = (2,3)\n\nThe cross product in 2D is scalar and calculated as:\nAB \u00d7 AC = (4)(3) - (0)(2) = 12 - 0 = 12\n\nSo, the area is (1/2) * |12| = 6 square meters.\n\nAll three methods gave me the same result, so I'm confident that the area is 6 square meters.\n\nIn summary, the fountain should be placed at the centroid, which is at (2,1), and the area of the flower bed is 6 square meters.\nDONE.\n</think>\n\nThe fountain should be placed at the centroid of the triangle, which is at coordinates (2, 1).

Let me start by recalling what a centroid is. From what I remember, the centroid of a triangle is the point where the three medians intersect, and it's also the average of the coordinates of the three vertices. That seems useful because the vertices are given as points A(0,0), B(4,0), and C(2,3).\n\nFirst, let me write down the coordinates of the three points again to make sure I have them right:\n\n- Point A is at (0, 0)\n- Point B is at (4, 0)\n- Point C is at (2, 3)\n\nOkay, so to find the centroid, I think I just need to find the average of the x-coordinates and the average of the y-coordinates of the vertices. That makes sense because it's the geometric center of the triangle. So, I'll set up the calculations for the x-coordinate first.\n\nFor the x-coordinate of the centroid (let's call it C_x), I need to add up all the x-coordinates of the vertices and then divide by 3. So:\n\nC_x = (0 + 4 + 2) / 3\n\nLet me calculate that. 0 plus 4 is 4, plus 2 is 6. Then, 6 divided by 3 is 2. So, C_x is 2.\n\nNow, for the y-coordinate of the centroid (C_y), I'll do the same but with the y-coordinates:\n\nC_y = (0 + 0 + 3) / 3\n\nCalculating that, 0 plus 0 is 0, plus 3 is 3. Divided by 3, that gives 1. So, C_y is 1.\n\nPutting those together, the centroid is at (2, 1). That should be the coordinates where the fountain is placed.\n\nNow, moving on to finding the area of the triangular flower bed. I remember there's a formula for the area of a triangle when you know the coordinates of its vertices. I think it's called the shoelace formula or something like that. Let me recall how it works.\n\nThe shoelace formula takes the coordinates of the vertices and multiplies them in a specific way, then takes half the absolute difference. The formula is:\n\nArea = |(x1(y2 - y3) + x2(y3 - y1) + x3(y1 - y2)) / 2|\n\nAlternatively, it can also be written as:\n\nArea = \u00bd |sum from i=1 to n of (x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i)|\n\nWhere the vertices are listed in order, and after the last vertex, you loop back to the first one.\n\nLet me label the points to make it clear:\n\n- Point A: (x1, y1) = (0, 0)\n- Point B: (x2, y2) = (4, 0)\n- Point C: (x3, y3) = (2, 3)\n\nPlugging these into the shoelace formula:\n\nFirst, I'll write down each term:\n\n1. x1(y2 - y3) = 0*(0 - 3) = 0*(-3) = 0\n2. x2(y3 - y1) = 4*(3 - 0) = 4*3 = 12\n3. x3(y1 - y2) = 2*(0 - 0) = 2*0 = 0\n\nNow, add these three terms together: 0 + 12 + 0 = 12\n\nThen, take the absolute value and divide by 2: |12| / 2 = 6\n\nSo, the area of the triangle is 6 square meters.\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake, let me try another method. Maybe using the base and height approach.\n\nLooking at the triangle, points A and B are on the x-axis, so the base AB is 4 meters (from x=0 to x=4). Now, I need the height, which is the perpendicular distance from point C to the base AB.\n\nSince AB is on the x-axis, the y-coordinate of point C is the height. Point C is at (2,3), so the height is 3 meters.\n\nUsing the area formula for a triangle: (base * height) / 2 = (4 * 3)/2 = 12/2 = 6\n\nSame result! So that confirms the area is indeed 6 square meters.\n\nAlternatively, I could also use vectors or determinants, but I think the shoelace formula and the base-height method have already given me consistent answers, so I'm confident that the area is 6.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\n- Centroid coordinates: (2,1)\n- Area of the triangle: 6 square meters.\n\nI think that's all. Let me just double-check the centroid calculation once more.\n\nCentroid formula: ( (x1 + x2 + x3)/3 , (y1 + y2 + y3)/3 )\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nx = (0 + 4 + 2)/3 = 6/3 = 2\n\ny = (0 + 0 + 3)/3 = 3/3 = 1\n\nYep, that's correct.

The height is the perpendicular distance from point C(2,3) to the base AB. Since AB lies along the x-axis, the y-coordinate of point C gives the height.

That seems straightforward. So, to find the centroid's coordinates, I can simply take the average of the x-coordinates and the average of the y-coordinates of points A, B, and C.\n\nLet me write that down. The x-coordinate of the centroid (let's call it \\( x_c \\)) should be the average of the x-coordinates of A, B, and C. Similarly, the y-coordinate (let's call it \\( y_c \\)) is the average of the y-coordinates.

To confirm, I can find the midpoints of the sides and see if the centroid lies two-thirds of the way from each vertex.\n\nLet me find the midpoints of each side.\n\nFirst, the midpoint of AB. Points A(0,0) and B(4,0).\n\nMidpoint formula is \\( \\left( \\frac{x_A + x_B}{2}, \\frac{y_A + y_B}{2} \\right) \\)\n\nSo, midpoint of AB is:\n\n\\( \\left( \\frac{0 + 4}{2}, \\frac{0 + 0}{2} \\right) = (2, 0) \\)\n\nNow, the midpoint of BC. Points B(4,0) and C(2,3).\n\nMidpoint is:\n\n\\( \\left( \\frac{4 + 2}{2}, \\frac{0 + 3}{2} \\right) = (3, 1.5) \\)\n\nNext, the midpoint of AC. Points A(0,0) and C(2,3).\n\nMidpoint is:\n\n\\( \\left( \\frac{0 + 2}{2}, \\frac{0 + 3}{2} \\right) = (1, 1.5) \\)\n\nSo, the midpoints are (2,0), (3,1.5), and (1,1.5). Now, the centroid should lie two-thirds of the way from each vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side.\n\nLet's check from point A(0,0) to the midpoint of BC (3,1.5). The vector from A to midpoint BC is (3,1.5). Two-thirds of this vector is (2,1). Adding this to point A's coordinates gives (0 + 2, 0 + 1) = (2,1), which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nSimilarly, from point B(4,0) to midpoint AC (1,1.5). The vector is (-3,1.5). Two-thirds is (-2,1). Adding to B gives (4 - 2, 0 + 1) = (2,1).\n\nFrom point C(2,3) to midpoint AB (2,0). The vector is (0,-3). Two-thirds is (0,-2). Adding to C gives (2 + 0, 3 - 2) = (2,1). So, all three checks confirm that the centroid is indeed at (2,1). That feels solid.\n\nNow, moving on to the area of the triangle. I recall that the area of a triangle given three vertices can be calculated using the shoelace formula. The formula is:\n\n\\( \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} |x_A(y_B - y_C) + x_B(y_C - y_A) + x_C(y_A - y_B)| \\)\n\nPlugging in the coordinates:\n\n\\( \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} |0*(0 - 3) + 4*(3 - 0) + 2*(0 - 0)| \\)\n\nSimplifying each term:\n\nFirst term: \\( 0*(0 - 3) = 0 \\)\n\nSecond term: \\( 4*(3 - 0) = 12 \\)\n\nThird term: \\( 2*(0 - 0) = 0 \\)\n\nAdding them up: \\( 0 + 12 + 0 = 12 \\)\n\nTaking the absolute value and multiplying by 1/2: \\( \\frac{1}{2} * 12 = 6 \\)\n\nSo, the area is 6 square meters.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the base and height. If I take AB as the base, which is from (0,0) to (4,0), so the length is 4 meters. To find the height, I need the perpendicular distance from point C(2,3) to the base AB. Since AB is along the x-axis, the y-coordinate of C is the height, which is 3 meters.\n\nUsing the formula for the area of a triangle: \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} \\)\n\nSo, \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times 4 \\times 3 = 6 \\) square meters. Same result, which is reassuring.\n\nAnother way to calculate the area is using vectors or determinants, but the shoelace formula and base-height method have already given me the same answer, so I'm confident the area is 6 square meters.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the centroid is at (2,1), and the area of the triangular flower bed is 6 square meters.\n</think>\n\nThe coordinates of the centroid are (2,1), and the area of the triangle is 6 square meters.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Find the Centroid:**\n   - The centroid (G) of a triangle with vertices A(x\u2081,y\u2081), B(x\u2082,y\u2082), and C(x\u2083,y\u2083) is given by:\n     \\( G\\left( \\frac{x\u2081 + x\u2082 + x\u2083}{3}, \\frac{y\u2081 + y\u2082 + y\u2083}{3} \\right) \\)\n   - Plugging in A(0,0), B(4,0), and C(2,3):\n     - x-coordinate: \\( \\frac{0 + 4 + 2}{3} = 2 \\)\n     - y-coordinate: \\( \\frac{0 + 0 + 3}{3} = 1 \\)\n   - Centroid G is at (2,1).\n\n2. **Calculate the Area of the Triangle:**\n   - Using the shoelace formula:\n     - Coordinates: A(0,0), B(4,0), C(2,3)\n     - Formula: \\( \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} |x\u2081(y\u2082 - y\u2083) + x\u2082(y\u2083 - y\u2081) + x\u2083(y\u2081 - y\u2082)| \\)\n     - Plugging in values:\n       \\( \\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} |0(0 - 3) + 4(3 - 0) + 2(0 - 0)| = \\frac{1}{2} |0 + 12 + 0| = 6 \\)\n   - Alternatively, using base (AB = 4m) and height (y-coordinate of C = 3m):\n     - Area = \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times 4 \\times 3 = 6 \\) square meters.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe fountain should be placed at coordinates (2,1), and the area of the triangular flower bed is 6 square meters.\n\nDONE."

The vertices of the triangle are at points A(0,0), B(4,0), and C(2,3). The gardener wants to place a small fountain at the centroid of the triangle. At what coordinates should the fountain be placed? Additionally, what is the area of the triangular flower bed in square meters? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this problem about a gardener planning a triangular flower bed. The vertices of the triangle are given as points A(0,0), B(4,0), and C(2,3). The gardener wants to place a fountain at the centroid of the triangle. I need to find the coordinates of the centroid and the area of the triangular flower bed.\n\nFirst, I remember that the centroid of a triangle is the point where the three medians intersect. A median connects a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side. So, to find the centroid, I can find the midpoints of each side and then average the coordinates of the vertices.\n\nLet me start by finding the midpoints of each side. \n\nStarting with side AB, which goes from point A(0,0) to point B(4,0). The midpoint formula is ((x1 + x2)/2, (y1 + y2)/2). Plugging in the values, the midpoint of AB is ((0 + 4)/2, (0 + 0)/2) = (2, 0). Let me call this point M.\n\nNext, the midpoint of side BC. Point B is at (4,0) and point C is at (2,3). Using the midpoint formula again, ((4 + 2)/2, (0 + 3)/2) = (3, 1.5). Let's name this point N.\n\nThen, the midpoint of side AC. Point A is at (0,0) and point C is at (2,3). So, ((0 + 2)/2, (0 + 3)/2) = (1, 1.5). Let's call this point P.\n\nNow, the centroid is the intersection of the medians, so it should be the average of all three vertices. Alternatively, it can be found by averaging the x-coordinates and the y-coordinates of the midpoints. Wait, actually, I think it's the average of the vertices, not the midpoints. Let me confirm that.\n\nYes, the centroid's coordinates are the average of the x-coordinates of the vertices and the average of the y-coordinates. So, for the x-coordinate: (0 + 4 + 2)/3 = 6/3 = 2. For the y-coordinate: (0 + 0 + 3)/3 = 3/3 = 1. So, the centroid is at (2,1).\n\nWait, let me cross-verify this by using the midpoints method. If I take the midpoints M(2,0), N(3,1.5), and P(1,1.5), then the centroid should be the average of these midpoints as well. So, x-coordinate: (2 + 3 + 1)/3 = 6/3 = 2. Y-coordinate: (0 + 1.5 + 1.5)/3 = 3/3 = 1. Yep, that matches. So, the centroid is definitely at (2,1).\n\nNow, moving on to finding the area of the triangle. I remember there's a formula called the shoelace formula which can be used when you have the coordinates of the vertices. The formula is: \n\nArea = |(x1(y2 - y3) + x2(y3 - y1) + x3(y1 - y2))/2|\n\nLet's plug in the points A(0,0), B(4,0), and C(2,3) into this formula.\n\nCalculating each term:\n\nFirst term: x1(y2 - y3) = 0*(0 - 3) = 0*(-3) = 0\nSecond term: x2(y3 - y1) = 4*(3 - 0) = 4*3 = 12\nThird term: x3(y1 - y2) = 2*(0 - 0) = 2*0 = 0\n\nAdding them up: 0 + 12 + 0 = 12\n\nTaking the absolute value and dividing by 2: |12| / 2 = 6\n\nSo, the area is 6 square meters.\n\nWait, let me try another method to confirm. I could also use the base and height approach. Let's take AB as the base. The length of AB is from (0,0) to (4,0), so that's 4 meters. Now, I need the height corresponding to this base. The height is the perpendicular distance from point C(2,3) to the base AB, which lies along the x-axis. Since AB is on the x-axis, the y-coordinate of point C is the height. So, the height is 3 meters.\n\nThen, area = (base * height)/2 = (4 * 3)/2 = 12/2 = 6 square meters. Yep, same result. So, I'm confident the area is 6.\n\nTherefore, the fountain should be placed at the centroid (2,1), and the area of the triangular flower bed is 6 square meters.\n</think>\n\nThe coordinates of the centroid are (2,1), and the area of the triangle is 6 square meters.\n\nThe coordinates of the fountain are \\boxed{(2,1)}, and the area of the triangular flower bed is \\boxed{6} square meters.\n\nDONE."

Additionally, what is the area of the triangular flower bed in square meters? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out where the gardener should place the fountain and also find the area of the triangular flower bed. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the flower bed is a triangle with vertices at points A(0,0), B(4,0), and C(2,3). The fountain needs to be placed at the centroid of this triangle. I remember that the centroid is the average of the coordinates of the three vertices. So, to find the centroid, I can use the midpoint formula but for three points instead of two.\n\nLet me recall the formula for the centroid (G) of a triangle with vertices (x\u2081, y\u2081), (x\u2082, y\u2082), and (x\u2083, y\u2083). It should be:\n\nG = ((x\u2081 + x\u2082 + x\u2083)/3, (y\u2081 + y\u2082 + y\u2083)/3)\n\nOkay, so applying this to points A, B, and C.\n\nFor the x-coordinate of the centroid:\n\nx = (0 + 4 + 2)/3\n\nLet me calculate that: 0 + 4 is 4, plus 2 is 6. Then 6 divided by 3 is 2. So x = 2.\n\nNow for the y-coordinate:\n\ny = (0 + 0 + 3)/3\n\nAdding those up: 0 + 0 is 0, plus 3 is 3. Divided by 3 is 1. So y = 1.\n\nTherefore, the centroid is at (2,1). So the fountain should be placed there.\n\nNext, I need to find the area of the triangular flower bed. I think there are a few ways to do this. One common method is using the base and height. Let me see if I can figure that out.\n\nLooking at the points, A is at (0,0), B is at (4,0), so the distance between A and B is 4 meters along the x-axis. That can be my base. Now I need the height, which is the perpendicular distance from point C to this base.\n\nPoint C is at (2,3). The base is along the x-axis, so the height would be the y-coordinate of point C, which is 3 meters. Wait, is that right? Because the base is on the x-axis, the height is just the vertical distance from C to the x-axis, which is indeed 3 meters.\n\nSo, area = (base * height)/2 = (4 * 3)/2 = 12/2 = 6 square meters.\n\nAlternatively, I remember there's a formula called the shoelace formula which can calculate the area of a polygon when given the coordinates of its vertices. Maybe I can use that to double-check my answer.\n\nThe shoelace formula for a triangle with vertices (x\u2081,y\u2081), (x\u2082,y\u2082), (x\u2083,y\u2083) is:\n\nArea = |(x\u2081(y\u2082 - y\u2083) + x\u2082(y\u2083 - y\u2081) + x\u2083(y\u2081 - y\u2082))/2|\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nx\u2081 = 0, y\u2081 = 0\n\nx\u2082 = 4, y\u2082 = 0\n\nx\u2083 = 2, y\u2083 = 3\n\nSo,\n\nArea = |(0*(0 - 3) + 4*(3 - 0) + 2*(0 - 0))/2|\n\nCalculating each term:\n\nFirst term: 0*(0 - 3) = 0*(-3) = 0\n\nSecond term: 4*(3 - 0) = 4*3 = 12\n\nThird term: 2*(0 - 0) = 2*0 = 0\n\nAdding them up: 0 + 12 + 0 = 12\n\nTake the absolute value (which is still 12) and divide by 2: 12/2 = 6\n\nSo the area is 6 square meters, which matches my previous calculation. That makes me confident that my answer is correct.\n\nJust to recap:\n\n- Centroid coordinates: (2,1)\n- Area: 6 square meters\n\nI think that's all the information needed. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and both methods gave me the same area, so I'm pretty sure it's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe centroid of the triangle is located at coordinates (2,1). The area of the triangular flower bed is 6 square meters.\n\n**Answer:**\nThe fountain should be placed at coordinates (2,1). The area of the triangular flower bed is 6 square meters.\n\nDONE."

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the centroid of a triangle is the point where the three medians intersect. A median is a line segment from a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side. The centroid is also the average of the coordinates of the three vertices. That seems useful because I can just take the average of the x-coordinates and the average of the y-coordinates of points A, B, and C.\n\nSo, let's write down the coordinates of the three points:\n\n- Point A is at (0, 0)\n- Point B is at (4, 0)\n- Point C is at (2, 3)\n\nTo find the centroid, I'll add up the x-coordinates and divide by 3, and do the same for the y-coordinates.\n\nCalculating the x-coordinate of the centroid:\n(0 + 4 + 2) / 3 = (6) / 3 = 2\n\nCalculating the y-coordinate of the centroid:\n(0 + 0 + 3) / 3 = (3) / 3 = 1\n\nSo, the centroid should be at (2, 1). That seems straightforward.\n\nNow, for the area of the triangle. I recall there's a formula for the area of a triangle given its coordinates. It's called the shoelace formula, which sounds a bit funny, but it works. The formula is:\n\nArea = |(x\u2081(y\u2082 - y\u2083) + x\u2082(y\u2083 - y\u2081) + x\u2083(y\u2081 - y\u2082)) / 2|\n\nLet me plug in the coordinates into this formula.\n\nPlugging in the points:\nx\u2081 = 0, y\u2081 = 0 (Point A)\nx\u2082 = 4, y\u2082 = 0 (Point B)\nx\u2083 = 2, y\u2083 = 3 (Point C)\n\nCalculating each term:\nFirst term: 0*(0 - 3) = 0*(-3) = 0\nSecond term: 4*(3 - 0) = 4*3 = 12\nThird term: 2*(0 - 0) = 2*0 = 0\n\nAdding them up: 0 + 12 + 0 = 12\n\nTake the absolute value (which is still 12) and divide by 2: 12 / 2 = 6\n\nSo, the area is 6 square meters.\n\nWait, let me double-check if I applied the formula correctly. Sometimes I mix up the order of the points. Let me try another method to confirm.\n\nAnother way to find the area is using the base and height. Let's take AB as the base. The length of AB is from x=0 to x=4, so that's 4 meters. Now, I need the height, which is the perpendicular distance from point C to the base AB.\n\nSince AB is along the x-axis (y=0), the height is just the y-coordinate of point C, which is 3 meters.\n\nUsing the formula for the area of a triangle: (base * height) / 2 = (4 * 3) / 2 = 12 / 2 = 6 square meters.\n\nOkay, that matches my previous result. So, I'm confident the area is 6 square meters.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the fountain should be placed at (2, 1) and the area is 6 square meters.\n</think>\n\nThe centroid of the triangle is found by averaging the coordinates of the vertices. Thus, the fountain should be placed at (2, 1). The area of the triangle is calculated using the shoelace formula or base and height, both yielding 6 square meters.\n\nThe fountain should be placed at coordinates (2, 1), and the area of the triangular flower bed is 6 square meters.\n\nDONE."
