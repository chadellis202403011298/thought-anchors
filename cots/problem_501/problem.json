  "question": "A gardener is planning a triangular flower bed in a coordinate system where each unit represents 1 meter. The vertices of the triangle are at points A(0,0), B(4,0), and C(2,3). The gardener wants to place a small fountain at the centroid of the triangle. At what coordinates should the fountain be placed? Additionally, what is the area of the triangular flower bed in square meters?",
  "answer": "Step 1: To find the centroid of a triangle, we calculate the average of the x-coordinates and the average of the y-coordinates of the three vertices.\n\nThe x-coordinate of the centroid = (x\u2081 + x\u2082 + x\u2083)/3 = (0 + 4 + 2)/3 = 6/3 = 2\n\nThe y-coordinate of the centroid = (y\u2081 + y\u2082 + y\u2083)/3 = (0 + 0 + 3)/3 = 3/3 = 1\n\nTherefore, the fountain should be placed at the coordinates (2, 1).\n\nStep 2: To find the area of the triangular flower bed, we can use the formula for the area of a triangle given its vertices in a coordinate system:\n\nArea = (1/2)|x\u2081(y\u2082 - y\u2083) + x\u2082(y\u2083 - y\u2081) + x\u2083(y\u2081 - y\u2082)|\n\nSubstituting our values:\nArea = (1/2)|0(0 - 3) + 4(3 - 0) + 2(0 - 0)|\nArea = (1/2)|0(-3) + 4(3) + 2(0)|\nArea = (1/2)|0 + 12 + 0|\nArea = (1/2)(12)\nArea = 6\n\nAlternatively, we could recognize that this is a right triangle with base 4 and height 3, so the area is (1/2) \u00d7 base \u00d7 height = (1/2) \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 = 6.\n\nThe area of the triangular flower bed is 6 square meters."
