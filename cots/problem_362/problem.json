  "question": "Four identical cubes are labeled with the letters A, B, C, and D on their visible faces as shown in the diagrams below. Each diagram shows three visible faces of a cube.\n\nCube 1: Front face shows A, Top face shows B, Right face shows C\nCube 2: Front face shows B, Top face shows C, Right face shows A\nCube 3: Front face shows C, Top face shows A, Right face shows B\nCube 4: Front face shows D, Top face shows B, Right face shows A\n\nWhich of these cubes could be the same cube viewed from different angles? (Note: Each cube has exactly six letters, one on each face.)",
  "answer": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which cubes could be identical when viewed from different angles.\n\nStep 1: Let's note what we know about each cube's visible faces:\n- Cube 1: A (front), B (top), C (right)\n- Cube 2: B (front), C (top), A (right)\n- Cube 3: C (front), A (top), B (right)\n- Cube 4: D (front), B (top), A (right)\n\nStep 2: For cubes to be the same, they must have the same set of letters, just arranged differently due to rotation.\n\nStep 3: Compare the visible letters on each cube:\n- Cubes 1, 2, and 3 all have the letters A, B, and C visible, just in different positions.\n- Cube 4 has letters D, B, and A visible, which includes D that isn't present in the other cubes.\n\nStep 4: Check if the letter arrangements are consistent with rotations:\n- If we rotate Cube 1 so that the right face (C) becomes the front, the top (B) stays on top, and the back (which we don't see) becomes the right, we'd have a configuration similar to Cube 3.\n- Similarly, if we rotate Cube 1 so the top face (B) becomes the front, the back becomes the top, and the front (A) becomes the right, we'd have a configuration similar to Cube 2.\n\nStep 5: Cube 4 cannot be the same as any other cube because it has letter D, which doesn't appear on the other cubes.\n\nTherefore, Cubes 1, 2, and 3 could all be the same cube viewed from different angles. Cube 4 is definitely a different cube."
