  "question": "Using only a compass and straightedge (ruler with no measurements), how would you construct a perpendicular line from a given point P to a line L, where point P does not lie on line L?",
  "answer": "To construct a perpendicular line from point P to line L:\n\n1. Place the compass point at P and adjust it to draw an arc that intersects line L at two points. Label these intersection points as A and B.\n\n2. Without changing the compass width, place the compass at point A and draw an arc below line L.\n\n3. Without changing the compass width, place the compass at point B and draw an arc that intersects the previous arc below line L. Label this intersection point as Q.\n\n4. Use the straightedge to draw a line connecting points P and Q. This line is perpendicular to line L.\n\nThis construction works because we've effectively created two congruent triangles on either side of the perpendicular line. The arcs drawn from A and B create point Q which is equidistant from both A and B, making PQ the perpendicular bisector of segment AB. Since AB lies on line L, the line PQ must be perpendicular to line L."
