  "question": "Consider the following 3\u00d73 matrix pattern:\n\n2 4 8\n6 8 12\n18 20 ?\n\nWhat value should replace the question mark to maintain the pattern?",
  "answer": "To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the matrix.\n\nLet's examine the rows and columns to look for relationships:\n\nRow 1: 2, 4, 8\nRow 2: 6, 8, 12\nRow 3: 18, 20, ?\n\nColumn 1: 2, 6, 18\nColumn 2: 4, 8, 20\nColumn 3: 8, 12, ?\n\nLooking at Column 1: \n- From 2 to 6: add 4\n- From 6 to 18: add 12 (which is 3 times 4)\n\nLooking at Column 2:\n- From 4 to 8: add 4\n- From 8 to 20: add 12 (which is 3 times 4)\n\nBased on this pattern, for Column 3:\n- From 8 to 12: add 4\n- From 12 to ?: should add 12 (which is 3 times 4)\n\nSo 12 + 12 = 24\n\nWe can verify this by checking Row 3:\n- From 18 to 20: add 2\n- From 20 to 24: add 4 (which is 2 times 2)\n\nThis follows a pattern where each step increases by a factor of 2.\n\nTherefore, the value that should replace the question mark is 24."
