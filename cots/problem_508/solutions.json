Let me take a look at the matrix again:\n\n2  4  8  \n6  8 12  \n18 20 ?\n\nHmm, okay. So, the first thing I notice is that each row seems to be increasing by a certain pattern. Maybe I should look at the differences between the numbers to see if there's a consistent ratio or something.\n\nStarting with the first row: 2, 4, 8. Let's see, 4 minus 2 is 2, and 8 minus 4 is 4. So the differences are 2 and 4. That seems like they're doubling each time. 2, then 2*2=4, so the next difference would be 8. But wait, that's the last number in the row. Hmm, maybe that's a clue.\n\nMoving on to the second row: 6, 8, 12. Let's calculate the differences here. 8 minus 6 is 2, and 12 minus 8 is 4 again. Same as the first row. So the differences are 2 and 4. Interesting, so both rows start with a difference of 2, then 4. So maybe the third row follows the same pattern.\n\nLooking at the third row: 18, 20, and then the question mark. Let's see, 20 minus 18 is 2, same as the previous rows. So the difference here is also 2. If the pattern continues, the next difference should be 4, which would mean the next number is 20 + 4 = 24. So the question mark should be 24.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check to make sure I'm not missing anything. Maybe there's a different pattern, like multiplication or something else.\n\nLooking again at the first row: 2, 4, 8. If I multiply 2 by 2, I get 4, and 4 by 2 is 8. So it's doubling each time. The second row: 6, 8, 12. 6 to 8 is +2, 8 to 12 is +4, which is the same as the first row's differences. The third row: 18, 20, and then ? If I continue the difference pattern, it's 2, then 4, so 20 + 4 is 24.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each column has a pattern. Let's check the columns.\n\nFirst column: 2, 6, 18. Let's see the differences: 6 - 2 = 4, 18 - 6 = 12. Hmm, that's a bit different. 4 and 12. Not sure if that helps.\n\nSecond column: 4, 8, 20. Differences: 8 - 4 = 4, 20 - 8 = 12. Same as the first column. Interesting.\n\nThird column: 8, 12, ?. Differences: 12 - 8 = 4, so the next difference would be 12 + 4 = 16? Wait, but in the first and second rows, the difference after 4 was 4 as well, making it 8 and 12. So if I follow that, the next difference should be 4 again, making the next number 12 + 4 = 16. But wait, that contradicts my earlier thought of 24. Hmm, maybe I need to reconcile this.\n\nWait, in the first row, the third number is 8, which is 4 + 4. In the second row, the third number is 12, which is 8 + 4. So the pattern is that after the second number, you add 4 to get the third number. So in the third row, after 20, adding 4 would give 24. But looking at the columns, the second column's difference is 4 and 12, which suggests a different pattern. Maybe it's not consistent across both rows and columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the entire matrix is built using a combination of row and column patterns. Let me see.\n\nLooking at the first column: 2, 6, 18. Let's see, 2 to 6 is multiplying by 3, and 6 to 18 is multiplying by 3 again. So each term is 3 times the previous. So 2 * 3 = 6, 6 * 3 = 18. So maybe the third term in the first column would be 18 * 3 = 54. But that doesn't fit with the row pattern.\n\nWait, but the first row's third number is 8, which is 2, 4, 8. So that's doubling each time. So maybe the first column is 2, 6, 18, which is 2, 2*3, 6*3. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the matrix is built using a combination of row and column operations. Let's see.\n\nLooking at the first row: 2, 4, 8. That's 2*1, 2*2, 2*4.\n\nSecond row: 6, 8, 12. That's 6*1, 6*something, 6*2. Wait, 6*1=6, 6*(something)=8, which would be 8/6 \u22481.333, and 6*2=12. Not sure.\n\nThird row: 18, 20, ?. 18*1=18, 18*(something)=20, which is about 1.111, and then 18*something=?. Maybe that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are related to multiplication by 3 each time. Let's see:\n\nFirst row: 2, 4, 8. 2*2=4, 4*2=8.\n\nSecond row: 6, 8, 12. 6*1.333\u22488, 8*1.5=12.\n\nThird row: 18, 20, ?. 18*1.111\u224820, then 20*something=?. Not consistent.\n\nHmm, maybe I should think differently. Perhaps each number is a multiple of the row number. Let's see.\n\nFirst row: 2,4,8. If row 1, maybe 2=2*1, 4=2*2, 8=2*4.\n\nSecond row: 6,8,12. If row 2, maybe 6=2*3, 8=2*4, 12=2*6.\n\nThird row: 18,20,?. Row 3, so 18=3*6, 20=3*(20/3)=approx 6.666, which doesn't make sense. Wait, 18 is 3*6, 20 is 3*(20/3)=20, which is not a multiple of 3. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each number is a multiple of the column index. Let's see:\n\nFirst column: 2,6,18. Column 1, so 2=2*1, 6=2*3, 18=2*9.\n\nSecond column:4,8,20. Column 2, so 4=4*1,8=4*2,20=4*5.\n\nThird column:8,12,?. Column 3, so 8=8*1,12=8*1.5, and the next would be 8*something. If it's following the previous pattern, 8,12, then 8*2=16. But 12 is 8*1.5, so maybe it's multiplying by 1.5 each time. 8*1.5=12, 12*1.5=18. But the question mark is after 20, which is in the second column. Hmm, not sure.\n\nWait, maybe the third column is 8,12,16 because 8 to 12 is +4, and 12 to 16 is +4. So the differences are consistent as +4. So the third number would be 16.\n\nBut earlier, looking at the third row, the difference was 2, then 4, suggesting 24. Now, looking at the third column, the difference is 4, suggesting 16. Hmm, conflict.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the third column's difference is 4, so from 8 to 12 is +4, and from 12 to ? is +4, so 16. But then, in the third row, the third number would be 20 +4=24. So which one is it?\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try another approach.\n\nLooking at the first row: 2,4,8. The ratio between each term is 2:4:8, which is a geometric progression with ratio 2.\n\nSecond row:6,8,12. Let's see, 6 to 8 is +2, 8 to 12 is +4. So the differences are 2 and 4 again.\n\nThird row:18,20,?. The difference is 2, so the next difference should be 4, making it 24.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the entire matrix is built using a combination of row and column operations. Let me see.\n\nLooking at the first column:2,6,18. Let's see, 2 to 6 is *3, 6 to 18 is *3. So it's a geometric progression with ratio 3.\n\nSecond column:4,8,20. 4 to 8 is *2, 8 to 20 is *2.5.\n\nThird column:8,12,?. 8 to 12 is +4, so if it's a geometric progression, the ratio would be 12/8=1.5. So the next term would be 12*1.5=18.\n\nBut wait, if the third column is a geometric progression with ratio 1.5, then 8,12,18. So the question mark would be 18.\n\nBut earlier, looking at the rows, the third row would need to have 24 as the last term. So which is it?\n\nHmm, maybe the pattern is that each row is a geometric progression, and each column is also a geometric progression. Let me check.\n\nFirst row:2,4,8. Common ratio 2.\n\nSecond row:6,8,12. Common ratio 1.333... (8/6 \u22481.333, 12/8=1.5). Not consistent.\n\nThird row:18,20,?. Common ratio would be 20/18\u22481.111, and then ?/20. Not consistent.\n\nSo maybe the rows are not geometric progressions, but the columns are.\n\nFirst column:2,6,18. Common ratio 3.\n\nSecond column:4,8,20. Common ratio 2.\n\nThird column:8,12,?. Common ratio 1.5.\n\nSo if the third column has a common ratio of 1.5, then 8*1.5=12, 12*1.5=18. So the question mark would be 18.\n\nBut then, looking at the third row:18,20,?. The difference is 2, then 4, so 24. So which one is correct?\n\nWait, maybe the pattern is that each row is increasing by 2, then 4, regardless of the column. So the third row would have 18,20,24.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the columns are increasing by a certain pattern.\n\nFirst column:2,6,18. 2 to 6 is +4, 6 to 18 is +12. So differences are 4 and 12.\n\nSecond column:4,8,20. 4 to 8 is +4, 8 to 20 is +12.\n\nThird column:8,12,?. 8 to 12 is +4, then 12 to ? should be +12, making it 24.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So in each column, the differences are +4, then +12. So the third column would go from 8 to 12 (+4), then 12 to 24 (+12). So the question mark is 24.\n\nBut earlier, looking at the rows, the third row would have differences +2, then +4, making it 24. So both row and column patterns point to 24.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the third column's common ratio is 1.5, leading to 18. But if the column differences are +4, +12, then the next term is 24. So which is it?\n\nI think the key is that the pattern is consistent across both rows and columns. So if the third column has differences +4, +12, then the next term is 24, which would also fit the third row's pattern of +2, +4.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So both the row and column patterns lead to the third number being 24.\n\nSo I think the answer is 24.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the value that replaces the question mark in the 3\u00d73 matrix, we analyze the pattern in both rows and columns.\n\n1. **Row Pattern Analysis:**\n   - First row: 2, 4, 8. Differences: 2, 4.\n   - Second row: 6, 8, 12. Differences: 2, 4.\n   - Third row: 18, 20, ?. Differences: 2, so next difference should be 4, making the last number 24.\n\n2. **Column Pattern Analysis:**\n   - Third column: 8, 12, ?. Differences: 4, so next difference should be 12, making the last number 24.\n\nBoth row and column patterns consistently lead to the value 24.\n\n**Answer:** 24\n\nDONE."
