What is the next number in the sequence?\n\nAs you work on this problem, first look for relationships between consecutive terms. Consider basic operations like addition, multiplication, exponentiation, or combinations of these. Once you think you've identified the pattern, verify it by checking if it works for all the given terms before determining the next value. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I've got this number sequence here: 2, 6, 18, 54, 162, and I need to figure out the rule that generates it. Then, I have to find the next number. Hmm, okay, let's start by looking at the differences between the numbers to see if that helps.\n\nStarting with the first two numbers: 2 and 6. The difference between them is 6 - 2 = 4. Next, 6 to 18: 18 - 6 = 12. Then, 18 to 54: 54 - 18 = 36. And 54 to 162: 162 - 54 = 108. So, the differences are 4, 12, 36, 108. Hmm, that seems like a pattern itself. Each difference is multiplying by 3: 4 \u00d7 3 = 12, 12 \u00d7 3 = 36, 36 \u00d7 3 = 108. If that's the case, the next difference should be 108 \u00d7 3 = 324. So, adding that to the last number, 162 + 324 = 486. That would make the next number 486.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's another way to look at it. Sometimes sequences can be related by multiplication or exponentiation. Let me try dividing each term by the previous one to see if that gives a pattern. 6 \u00f7 2 = 3, 18 \u00f7 6 = 3, 54 \u00f7 18 = 3, 162 \u00f7 54 = 3. Oh, so each term is 3 times the previous one. That makes sense because 2 \u00d7 3 = 6, 6 \u00d7 3 = 18, 18 \u00d7 3 = 54, and so on. So, the common ratio is 3. That means this is a geometric sequence where each term is multiplied by 3. Therefore, the next term should be 162 \u00d7 3 = 486. That matches what I got earlier by looking at the differences.\n\nJust to double-check, let me apply the rule to all the given terms. Starting with 2, multiplying by 3 gives 6. Then 6 \u00d7 3 = 18, 18 \u00d7 3 = 54, and 54 \u00d7 3 = 162. Yep, that works perfectly. So, the pattern is consistent, and the next number is definitely 486.\n</think>\n\nThe sequence is a geometric progression where each term is multiplied by 3. The next number is 486.\n\n**Answer:** The next number in the sequence is **486**.\n\nDONE."

What is the next number in the sequence?\n\nAs you work on this problem, first look for relationships between consecutive terms. Consider basic operations like addition, multiplication, exponentiation, or combinations of these. Once you think you've identified the pattern, verify it by checking if it works for all the given terms before determining the next value. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this number sequence here: 2, 6, 18, 54, 162, and I need to figure out the pattern to find the next number. Hmm, let's see. I remember that sometimes sequences follow a pattern involving multiplication, division, or exponents. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll list out the numbers again to get a clearer view:\n\n1. 2\n2. 6\n3. 18\n4. 54\n5. 162\n6. ?\n\nOkay, let's look at the differences between consecutive terms. Sometimes, the differences can tell us if it's an arithmetic or geometric sequence. But let's check:\n\n- 6 - 2 = 4\n- 18 - 6 = 12\n- 54 - 18 = 36\n- 162 - 54 = 108\n\nSo the differences are 4, 12, 36, 108. Hmm, I notice that each difference is multiplying by 3:\n\n- 4 * 3 = 12\n- 12 * 3 = 36\n- 36 * 3 = 108\n\nThat's interesting. So the differences themselves are increasing by a factor of 3 each time. But does that help me find the next term?\n\nWait, maybe it's not just about the differences. Let me try looking at the ratio between consecutive terms instead.\n\n- 6 / 2 = 3\n- 18 / 6 = 3\n- 54 / 18 = 3\n- 162 / 54 = 3\n\nOh, that's a consistent ratio of 3. So each term is 3 times the previous term. That seems like a geometric sequence where each term is multiplied by 3.\n\nLet me verify this with the initial terms:\n\n- 2 * 3 = 6 \u2714\ufe0f\n- 6 * 3 = 18 \u2714\ufe0f\n- 18 * 3 = 54 \u2714\ufe0f\n- 54 * 3 = 162 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo the pattern is multiplying by 3 each time. Therefore, the next term should be 162 * 3.\n\nCalculating that: 162 * 3 = 486.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Is there another possible pattern? Maybe combining addition and multiplication? For example, adding 4 each time but also considering multiplication.\n\nBut looking at the differences, they are 4, 12, 36, 108, which are multiples of 4 times 1, 3, 9, 27. That's like 4 multiplied by powers of 3. So 4 * 3^0 = 4, 4 * 3^1 = 12, 4 * 3^2 = 36, 4 * 3^3 = 108. So the difference between each term is increasing by a factor of 3 each time.\n\nBut if the ratio between terms is consistently 3, then the differences are also increasing by 3 each time. So it's consistent with a geometric progression.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sequence is defined by a formula involving exponents. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the terms:\n\nTerm 1: 2 = 2\nTerm 2: 6 = 2 * 3\nTerm 3: 18 = 2 * 3^2\nTerm 4: 54 = 2 * 3^3\nTerm 5: 162 = 2 * 3^4\n\nSo it seems like each term is 2 multiplied by 3 raised to the power of one less than the term's position.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Term 1: 2 * 3^(1-1) = 2 * 3^0 = 2 * 1 = 2\n- Term 2: 2 * 3^(2-1) = 2 * 3^1 = 6\n- Term 3: 2 * 3^(3-1) = 2 * 3^2 = 18\n- Term 4: 2 * 3^(4-1) = 2 * 3^3 = 54\n- Term 5: 2 * 3^(5-1) = 2 * 3^4 = 162\n\nSo the general formula seems to be Term n = 2 * 3^(n-1). Therefore, the next term, which would be Term 6, is 2 * 3^(6-1) = 2 * 3^5.\n\nCalculating that: 3^5 = 243, so 2 * 243 = 486.\n\nThat matches with the earlier result. So both approaches confirm that the next term is 486.\n\nI think that's solid. No contradictions here. The ratio between terms is consistent, and the formula aligns with all the given terms. So I'm confident that 486 is the correct next number in the sequence.\n</think>\n\nThe sequence follows a geometric pattern where each term is multiplied by 3. Starting with 2, each subsequent term is 3 times the previous one. \n\n2, 6 (2\u00d73), 18 (6\u00d73), 54 (18\u00d73), 162 (54\u00d73), so the next term is 162\u00d73 = 486.\n\nDONE."
