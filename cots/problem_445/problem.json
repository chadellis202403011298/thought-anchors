  "question": "Consider the following number sequence: 2, 6, 18, 54, 162, ?\n\nTry to identify the rule that generates this sequence. What is the next number in the sequence?\n\nAs you work on this problem, first look for relationships between consecutive terms. Consider basic operations like addition, multiplication, exponentiation, or combinations of these. Once you think you've identified the pattern, verify it by checking if it works for all the given terms before determining the next value.",
  "answer": "To solve this problem, I need to identify the pattern in the sequence 2, 6, 18, 54, 162, ?.\n\nStep 1: Examine the relationship between consecutive terms.\nLet's calculate the ratio between consecutive terms:\n6 \u00f7 2 = 3\n18 \u00f7 6 = 3\n54 \u00f7 18 = 3\n162 \u00f7 54 = 3\n\nStep 2: Identify the rule.\nI observe that each number is exactly 3 times the previous number. The pattern follows the rule: multiply the previous term by 3 to get the next term.\n\nStep 3: Verify the pattern with the given terms.\n2 \u00d7 3 = 6 \u2713\n6 \u00d7 3 = 18 \u2713\n18 \u00d7 3 = 54 \u2713\n54 \u00d7 3 = 162 \u2713\n\nStep 4: Apply the rule to find the next number.\nThe next number would be 162 \u00d7 3 = 486\n\nTherefore, the next number in the sequence is 486."
