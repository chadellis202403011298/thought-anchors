Determine whether this proposition is satisfiable (can be true for some assignment of truth values to P and Q) or unsatisfiable (always false regardless of the truth values of P and Q). Carefully analyze the proposition using logical equivalences and truth values. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this logical proposition: (P \u2192 Q) \u2227 (\u00acQ). I need to figure out if it's satisfiable or unsatisfiable. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that in logic, a proposition is satisfiable if there's at least one truth value assignment to the variables (P and Q in this case) that makes the entire proposition true. If no such assignment exists, it's unsatisfiable.\n\nLet me start by understanding each part of the proposition separately. The proposition has two parts connected by a conjunction (\u2205): (P \u2192 Q) and (\u00acQ). So, the entire proposition is true only if both (P \u2192 Q) is true and (\u00acQ) is true.\n\nLet me recall the implications. The implication P \u2192 Q is equivalent to \u00acP \u2228 Q. So, I can rewrite the first part as \u00acP \u2228 Q. Now, the entire proposition becomes (\u00acP \u2228 Q) \u2227 (\u00acQ).\n\nHmm, let's analyze this. Using distributive laws, I can expand this to \u00acP \u2227 \u00acQ \u2228 Q \u2227 \u00acQ. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I should look at it differently. Let me consider the possible truth values for P and Q.\n\nThere are four possible combinations since there are two variables:\n\n1. P is true, Q is true.\n2. P is true, Q is false.\n3. P is false, Q is true.\n4. P is false, Q is false.\n\nLet me evaluate (P \u2192 Q) and (\u00acQ) for each case.\n\nCase 1: P = T, Q = T\n- P \u2192 Q is T (because T \u2192 T is T).\n- \u00acQ is F.\n- So, (T) \u2227 (F) = F.\n\nCase 2: P = T, Q = F\n- P \u2192 Q is F (because T \u2192 F is F).\n- \u00acQ is T.\n- So, (F) \u2227 (T) = F.\n\nCase 3: P = F, Q = T\n- P \u2192 Q is T (because F \u2192 T is T).\n- \u00acQ is F.\n- So, (T) \u2227 (F) = F.\n\nCase 4: P = F, Q = F\n- P \u2192 Q is T (because F \u2192 F is T).\n- \u00acQ is T.\n- So, (T) \u2227 (T) = T.\n\nWait, in case 4, both parts are true, so the entire proposition is true. That means there's at least one assignment where the proposition is true\u2014specifically, when P is false and Q is false.\n\nTherefore, the proposition is satisfiable because there exists a truth value assignment where it holds true.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. I systematically checked all possible combinations and found that when P is false and Q is false, the proposition is true. So, it's satisfiable.\n</think>\n\nThe proposition (P \u2192 Q) \u2227 (\u00acQ) is satisfiable because when P is false and Q is false, the proposition evaluates to true.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Understand the Proposition**: The proposition is a conjunction of two parts: (P \u2192 Q) and (\u00acQ).\n\n2. **Rewrite the Implication**: Convert P \u2192 Q to \u00acP \u2228 Q, so the proposition becomes (\u00acP \u2228 Q) \u2227 (\u00acQ).\n\n3. **Analyze Truth Values**:\n   - **Case 1**: P=T, Q=T\n     - \u00acP \u2228 Q = F \u2228 T = T\n     - \u00acQ = F\n     - T \u2227 F = F\n   - **Case 2**: P=T, Q=F\n     - \u00acP \u2228 Q = F \u2228 F = F\n     - \u00acQ = T\n     - F \u2227 T = F\n   - **Case 3**: P=F, Q=T\n     - \u00acP \u2228 Q = T \u2228 T = T\n     - \u00acQ = F\n     - T \u2227 F = F\n   - **Case 4**: P=F, Q=F\n     - \u00acP \u2228 Q = T \u2228 F = T\n     - \u00acQ = T\n     - T \u2227 T = T\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The proposition is true in Case 4, making it satisfiable.\n\nDONE."

Carefully analyze the proposition using logical equivalences and truth values. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I've got this logical proposition to analyze: (P \u2192 Q) \u2227 (\u00acQ). I need to figure out if it's satisfiable or unsatisfiable. Hmm, okay, let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst off, I remember that P \u2192 Q is an implication. I also recall that an implication can be rewritten using logical equivalences. Specifically, P \u2192 Q is equivalent to \u00acP \u2228 Q. That might come in handy.\n\nSo, let's rewrite the entire proposition using this equivalence. That would give me (\u00acP \u2228 Q) \u2227 (\u00acQ). Now, I need to see if this combination can be true for some truth values of P and Q, or if it's always false.\n\nTo do that, I should consider all possible truth values for P and Q. Since there are only two variables, P and Q, there are four possible combinations: both true, both false, P true and Q false, and P false and Q true.\n\nLet me list them out:\n\n1. P is True, Q is True\n2. P is True, Q is False\n3. P is False, Q is True\n4. P is False, Q is False\n\nNow, I'll evaluate the proposition (\u00acP \u2228 Q) \u2227 (\u00acQ) for each case.\n\nCase 1: P=True, Q=True\n- \u00acP is False\n- Q is True\n- So, \u00acP \u2228 Q becomes False \u2228 True, which is True\n- \u00acQ is False\n- So, the entire proposition is True \u2227 False, which is False\n\nCase 2: P=True, Q=False\n- \u00acP is False\n- Q is False\n- So, \u00acP \u2228 Q becomes False \u2228 False, which is False\n- \u00acQ is True\n- So, the entire proposition is False \u2227 True, which is False\n\nCase 3: P=False, Q=True\n- \u00acP is True\n- Q is True\n- So, \u00acP \u2228 Q becomes True \u2228 True, which is True\n- \u00acQ is False\n- So, the entire proposition is True \u2227 False, which is False\n\nCase 4: P=False, Q=False\n- \u00acP is True\n- Q is False\n- So, \u00acP \u2228 Q becomes True \u2228 False, which is True\n- \u00acQ is True\n- So, the entire proposition is True \u2227 True, which is True\n\nOkay, so in the fourth case, where both P is False and Q is False, the proposition is True. That means there's at least one truth value assignment where the proposition is true, which makes it satisfiable.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Did I make any mistakes in evaluating the cases? Let me go through them again quickly.\n\nCase 1: P=True, Q=True\n- (\u00acP \u2228 Q) is False \u2228 True = True\n- (\u00acQ) is False\n- True \u2227 False = False \u2714\ufe0f\n\nCase 2: P=True, Q=False\n- (\u00acP \u2228 Q) = False \u2228 False = False\n- (\u00acQ) = True\n- False \u2227 True = False \u2714\ufe0f\n\nCase 3: P=False, Q=True\n- (\u00acP \u2228 Q) = True \u2228 True = True\n- (\u00acQ) = False\n- True \u2227 False = False \u2714\ufe0f\n\nCase 4: P=False, Q=False\n- (\u00acP \u2228 Q) = True \u2228 False = True\n- (\u00acQ) = True\n- True \u2227 True = True \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYep, looks like I didn't make any mistakes. Only in the fourth case does the proposition hold true. So, it's satisfiable because there's at least one assignment where it's true.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach this using logical equivalences without enumerating all cases. Let's see.\n\nStarting with (P \u2192 Q) \u2227 (\u00acQ). As I did earlier, rewrite P \u2192 Q as \u00acP \u2228 Q. So, it becomes (\u00acP \u2228 Q) \u2227 (\u00acQ).\n\nUsing distributive laws, I can expand this to \u00acP \u2227 \u00acQ \u2228 Q \u2227 \u00acQ.\n\nBut wait, Q \u2227 \u00acQ is a contradiction, which is always False. So, that part is out. So, we're left with \u00acP \u2227 \u00acQ.\n\nTherefore, the entire proposition simplifies to \u00acP \u2227 \u00acQ.\n\nNow, \u00acP \u2227 \u00acQ is only True when both P is False and Q is False. So, that aligns with what I found earlier.\n\nSince there's an assignment where both P and Q are False, making \u00acP \u2227 \u00acQ True, the original proposition is satisfiable.\n\nI think that's solid. I considered both methods: enumerating all cases and using logical equivalences. Both led me to the same conclusion. So, I'm confident in my answer.\n</think>\n\nThe compound logical proposition (P \u2192 Q) \u2227 (\u00acQ) is satisfiable because when P is false and Q is false, the proposition evaluates to true.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Rewrite the implication**: P \u2192 Q is equivalent to \u00acP \u2228 Q.\n2. **Substitute into the original proposition**: (\u00acP \u2228 Q) \u2227 (\u00acQ).\n3. **Simplify using distributive law**: \u00acP \u2227 \u00acQ \u2228 Q \u2227 \u00acQ. Since Q \u2227 \u00acQ is a contradiction (False), it simplifies to \u00acP \u2227 \u00acQ.\n4. **Analyze \u00acP \u2227 \u00acQ**: This is true only when P is false and Q is false.\n5. **Conclusion**: Since there's an assignment (P=False, Q=False) where the proposition is true, it's satisfiable.\n\nDONE."

So maybe I can rewrite the whole proposition using that equivalence. Let me try that:\n\nOriginal proposition: (P \u2192 Q) \u2227 (\u00acQ)\nAfter rewriting: (\u00acP \u2228 Q) \u2227 (\u00acQ)\n\nNow, I can use distributive laws to simplify this. Distributive law says that (A \u2227 B) \u2228 (A \u2227 \u00acB) is equivalent to A \u2228 (B \u2227 \u00acB). But wait, B \u2227 \u00acB is always false, right? Because something can't be both true and false at the same time. So actually, (\u00acP \u2228 Q) \u2227 (\u00acQ) simplifies to \u00acP \u2227 \u00acQ \u2228 Q \u2227 \u00acQ. But since Q \u2227 \u00acQ is always false, that whole part becomes \u00acP \u2227 \u00acQ.\n\nWait, no, maybe I should distribute differently. Let me think again. (\u00acP \u2228 Q) \u2227 (\u00acQ) can be distributed as \u00acP \u2227 \u00acQ \u2228 Q \u2227 \u00acQ. As I thought, Q \u2227 \u00acQ is false, so it reduces to \u00acP \u2227 \u00acQ. So the entire proposition simplifies to \u00acP \u2227 \u00acQ.\n\nNow, \u00acP \u2227 \u00acQ is only true when both P is false and Q is false. So is there an assignment where P is false and Q is false? Yes, if I let P be false and Q be false, then both \u00acP and \u00acQ are true, making the whole proposition true. Therefore, the proposition is satisfiable because there exists at least one truth value assignment where it's true.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check by considering all possible truth values for P and Q. There are four cases:\n\n1. P = True, Q = True:\n   (P \u2192 Q) is True, \u00acQ is False. So (True) \u2227 (False) is False.\n\n2. P = True, Q = False:\n   (P \u2192 Q) is False, \u00acQ is True. So (False) \u2227 (True) is False.\n\n3. P = False, Q = True:\n   (P \u2192 Q) is True, \u00acQ is False. So (True) \u2227 (False) is False.\n\n4. P = False, Q = False:\n   (P \u2192 Q) is True, \u00acQ is True. So (True) \u2227 (True) is True.\n\nSo in only one case, when P is false and Q is false, the proposition is true. That means it's satisfiable because there's at least one assignment where it holds.\n</think>\n\nThe proposition (P \u2192 Q) \u2227 (\u00acQ) is satisfiable because when P is false and Q is false, the proposition evaluates to true.\n\nDONE."

So, that second part is always false. So, the entire expression simplifies to \u00acP \u2227 \u00acQ.\n\nSo now, the proposition is \u00acP \u2227 \u00acQ. That means both \u00acP and \u00acQ have to be true for the whole proposition to be true. In other words, P must be false and Q must be false.\n\nLet me think about the truth table for this. There are four possible combinations since there are two propositions, P and Q.\n\n1. P = True, Q = True:\n   - \u00acP = False\n   - \u00acQ = False\n   - \u00acP \u2227 \u00acQ = False \u2227 False = False\n\n2.

Therefore, it is satisfiable because there exists an assignment of truth values (P=False, Q=False) that makes the proposition true.\n\nWait, let me double-check. The original proposition was (P \u2192 Q) \u2227 (\u00acQ). If P is false and Q is false, then P \u2192 Q is true because a false statement can imply anything. So, (P \u2192 Q) is true, and \u00acQ is also true. Therefore, the conjunction is true. That checks out.\n\nBut what if P is true and Q is false? Then P \u2192 Q would be false because a true statement cannot imply a false one. So, (P \u2192 Q) is false, and \u00acQ is true, making the conjunction false. Similarly, if P is true and Q is true, P \u2192 Q is true, but \u00acQ is false, so the conjunction is false. If P is false and Q is true, P \u2192 Q is true, but \u00acQ is false, so again the conjunction is false.\n\nSo, only when both P and Q are false does the proposition hold true. Therefore, it's satisfiable.\n\nI think that's it. The proposition can be true under certain truth assignments, so it's satisfiable.\nDONE.\n</think>\n\nThe proposition (P \u2192 Q) \u2227 (\u00acQ) is satisfiable because when P is false and Q is false, the proposition holds true.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Understand the Proposition:**\n   - The proposition is (P \u2192 Q) \u2227 (\u00acQ), which involves two propositions P and Q.\n\n2. **Rewrite Implication as a Disjunction:**\n   - Use the equivalence P \u2192 Q \u2261 \u00acP \u2228 Q.\n   - Substitute into the original proposition: (\u00acP \u2228 Q) \u2227 (\u00acQ).\n\n3. **Apply Distributive Law:**\n   - Distribute the conjunction over the disjunction: (\u00acP \u2227 \u00acQ) \u2228 (Q \u2227 \u00acQ).\n\n4. **Simplify Using Logical Equivalences:**\n   - Recognize that Q \u2227 \u00acQ is a contradiction, which is always false.\n   - Therefore, the expression simplifies to \u00acP \u2227 \u00acQ.\n\n5. **Analyze the Simplified Proposition:**\n   - \u00acP \u2227 \u00acQ means both P and Q must be false for the proposition to be true.\n\n6. **Construct a Truth Table:**\n   - Enumerate all possible truth values for P and Q.\n   - Calculate the truth value of \u00acP and \u00acQ for each combination.\n   - Determine the conjunction \u00acP \u2227 \u00acQ for each case.\n\n7. **Determine Satisfiability:**\n   - Identify if there exists at least one truth assignment where the proposition is true.\n   - Find that when P is false and Q is false, the proposition is true.\n\n8. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since such an assignment exists, the proposition is satisfiable.\n\n**Answer:** The proposition (P \u2192 Q) \u2227 (\u00acQ) is satisfiable because it can be true when both P and Q are false. \n\nDONE."

I need to figure out if it's satisfiable or unsatisfiable. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that in logic, a proposition is satisfiable if there's at least one truth value assignment to the variables (in this case, P and Q) that makes the entire proposition true. If no matter what truth values P and Q take, the proposition is always false, then it's unsatisfiable.\n\nOkay, so let's start by understanding each part of the proposition. The proposition has two parts connected by a conjunction (\u2227), which means both parts have to be true for the whole proposition to be true. The two parts are (P \u2192 Q) and (\u00acQ).\n\nLet me recall what P \u2192 Q means. I think it's equivalent to \u00acP \u2228 Q. So, P implies Q is the same as \"not P or Q.\" That could be useful.\n\nSo, substituting that in, the proposition becomes (\u00acP \u2228 Q) \u2227 (\u00acQ). Hmm, maybe I can simplify this further using distributive laws or other equivalences.\n\nWait, let me think about the truth table approach.

P = True, Q = True\n2. P = True, Q = False\n3. P = False, Q = True\n4.

Therefore, there exists at least one assignment where the proposition is true, which means it's satisfiable.\n\nWait, let me double-check.

Carefully analyze the proposition using logical equivalences and truth values. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I have this logical proposition: (P \u2192 Q) \u2227 (\u00acQ). I need to figure out if it's satisfiable or unsatisfiable. Hmm, let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that in logic, a proposition is satisfiable if there's at least one truth value assignment to the variables (in this case, P and Q) that makes the entire proposition true. If no such assignment exists, then it's unsatisfiable.\n\nThe proposition is an conjunction of two parts: (P \u2192 Q) and (\u00acQ). So, for the whole thing to be true, both (P \u2192 Q) and (\u00acQ) must be true at the same time.\n\nLet me recall what P \u2192 Q means. I think it's equivalent to (\u00acP \u2228 Q). So, substituting that in, the proposition becomes (\u00acP \u2228 Q) \u2227 (\u00acQ).\n\nWait, maybe I should construct a truth table for all possible values of P and Q. There are only two variables, so four possible combinations. Let me list them out:\n\n1. P is true, Q is true\n2. P is true, Q is false\n3. P is false, Q is true\n4. P is false, Q is false\n\nFor each of these, I can compute the truth values of (P \u2192 Q) and (\u00acQ), then see if their conjunction is true.\n\nStarting with case 1: P = T, Q = T\n- (P \u2192 Q) becomes (T \u2192 T), which is T.\n- (\u00acQ) becomes (\u00acT), which is F.\n- So, (T \u2227 F) is F. So the proposition is false here.\n\nCase 2: P = T, Q = F\n- (T \u2192 F) is F.\n- (\u00acF) is T.\n- (F \u2227 T) is F. So again, false.\n\nCase 3: P = F, Q = T\n- (F \u2192 T) is T.\n- (\u00acT) is F.\n- (T \u2227 F) is F. Still false.\n\nCase 4: P = F, Q = F\n- (F \u2192 F) is T.\n- (\u00acF) is T.\n- (T \u2227 T) is T. So here, the proposition is true.\n\nWait, so in only one case out of four does the proposition hold true. That means there exists at least one assignment where the proposition is true, so it's satisfiable.\n\nBut just to make sure I didn't make a mistake, let me think differently. Maybe using logical equivalences instead of truth tables.\n\nStarting with the original proposition: (P \u2192 Q) \u2227 (\u00acQ)\n\nI know that P \u2192 Q is equivalent to \u00acP \u2228 Q, so substituting that in, we get:\n\n(\u00acP \u2228 Q) \u2227 (\u00acQ)\n\nLet me distribute the conjunction over the disjunction:\n\n(\u00acP \u2227 \u00acQ) \u2228 (Q \u2227 \u00acQ)\n\nWait, Q \u2227 \u00acQ is a contradiction, which is always false. So the entire expression simplifies to (\u00acP \u2227 \u00acQ) \u2228 F, which is just \u00acP \u2227 \u00acQ.\n\nSo the proposition simplifies to \u00acP \u2227 \u00acQ. That means both P must be false and Q must be false.\n\nIs there a truth assignment where both P and Q are false? Yes, when P is F and Q is F. In that case, \u00acP is T and \u00acQ is T, so their conjunction is T, making the whole proposition T.\n\nTherefore, the proposition is satisfiable because there's an assignment where it's true.\n\nI think that confirms it. So the answer is satisfiable.\n</think>\n\nThe compound logical proposition (P \u2192 Q) \u2227 (\u00acQ) is satisfiable because when P is false and Q is false, both (P \u2192 Q) and (\u00acQ) are true. \n\nDONE."

I need to figure out if it's satisfiable or unsatisfiable. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that P \u2192 Q is equivalent to \u00acP \u2228 Q. So, maybe I can rewrite the whole proposition using this equivalence. Let me try that:\n\nOriginal proposition: (P \u2192 Q) \u2227 (\u00acQ)\nRewritten: (\u00acP \u2228 Q) \u2227 (\u00acQ)\n\nNow, I can use distributive laws or maybe some other logical equivalences to simplify this further. Let's distribute the conjunction over the disjunction:\n\n(\u00acP \u2228 Q) \u2227 (\u00acQ) = \u00acP \u2227 (Q \u2227 \u00acQ) \u2228 Q \u2227 \u00acQ\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I should use the distributive law properly. Let me recall: A \u2227 (B \u2228 C) = (A \u2227 B) \u2228 (A \u2227 C). So applying that here:\n\n(\u00acP \u2228 Q) \u2227 (\u00acQ) = (\u00acP \u2227 \u00acQ) \u2228 (Q \u2227 \u00acQ)\n\nOkay, that looks better. Now, I can analyze each part separately.\n\nFirst part: \u00acP \u2227 \u00acQ. That means both P is false and Q is false.\n\nSecond part: Q \u2227 \u00acQ. This is a contradiction because something can't be both Q and not Q at the same time. So, Q \u2227 \u00acQ is always false.\n\nSo, putting it back together: (\u00acP \u2227 \u00acQ) \u2228 (Q \u2227 \u00acQ) = (\u00acP \u2227 \u00acQ) \u2228 false.\n\nSince the second part is false, the entire proposition simplifies to \u00acP \u2227 \u00acQ.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible truth values for P and Q.\n\nCase 1: P is true, Q is true.\n\u00acP is false, \u00acQ is false. So, \u00acP \u2227 \u00acQ is false. Therefore, the proposition is false.\n\nCase 2: P is true, Q is false.\n\u00acP is false, \u00acQ is true. So, \u00acP \u2227 \u00acQ is false. The proposition is false.\n\nCase 3: P is false, Q is true.\n\u00acP is true, \u00acQ is false. So, \u00acP \u2227 \u00acQ is false. The proposition is false.\n\nCase 4: P is false, Q is false.\n\u00acP is true, \u00acQ is true. So, \u00acP \u2227 \u00acQ is true. The proposition is true.\n\nWait a minute, so in only one case does the proposition become true. That means there exists at least one assignment where the proposition is true, specifically when P is false and Q is false.\n\nTherefore, the proposition is satisfiable because it can be true under certain truth values of P and Q.\n\nI think that's it. So, the answer is that the proposition is satisfiable.\n</think>\n\nThe proposition (P \u2192 Q) \u2227 (\u00acQ) is satisfiable because it can be true when P is false and Q is false.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Rewrite Implication:** Start by converting the implication P \u2192 Q into its equivalent form \u00acP \u2228 Q.\n   \n   (P \u2192 Q) \u2227 (\u00acQ) becomes (\u00acP \u2228 Q) \u2227 (\u00acQ).\n\n2. **Apply Distributive Law:** Distribute the conjunction over the disjunction.\n\n   (\u00acP \u2228 Q) \u2227 (\u00acQ) = (\u00acP \u2227 \u00acQ) \u2228 (Q \u2227 \u00acQ).\n\n3. **Simplify:** Recognize that Q \u2227 \u00acQ is a contradiction, which is always false.\n\n   Therefore, the expression simplifies to (\u00acP \u2227 \u00acQ) \u2228 false, which reduces to \u00acP \u2227 \u00acQ.\n\n4. **Analyze Truth Values:**\n   \n   - If P is true and Q is true: \u00acP \u2227 \u00acQ is false.\n   - If P is true and Q is false: \u00acP \u2227 \u00acQ is false.\n   - If P is false and Q is true: \u00acP \u2227 \u00acQ is false.\n   - If P is false and Q is false: \u00acP \u2227 \u00acQ is true.\n\n5. **Conclusion:** Since there is at least one truth value assignment (P = false, Q = false) where the proposition is true, it is satisfiable.\n\nDONE."

If no such assignment exists, then it's unsatisfiable.\n\nLet's start by recalling what each part means. The proposition is an conjunction of two parts: (P \u2192 Q) and (\u00acQ). So, both parts need to be true for the entire proposition to be true.\n\nI know that P \u2192 Q is equivalent to \u00acP \u2228 Q. So, I can rewrite the original proposition as (\u00acP \u2228 Q) \u2227 (\u00acQ). That might make it easier to analyze.\n\nNow, let me consider the possible truth values for P and Q. Since there are two variables, each can be either true (T) or false (F). So, there are four possible combinations:\n\n1. P = T, Q = T\n2. P = T, Q = F\n3. P = F, Q = T\n4. P = F, Q = F\n\nI'll evaluate each case to see if the proposition holds.\n\n**Case 1: P = T, Q = T**\n\n- \u00acP = F\n- Q = T\n- \u00acQ = F\n- So, (\u00acP \u2228 Q) = F \u2228 T = T\n- (\u00acQ) = F\n- Therefore, (T) \u2227 (F) = F\n\nThe proposition is false in this case.\n\n**Case 2: P = T, Q = F**\n\n- \u00acP = F\n- Q = F\n- \u00acQ = T\n- So, (\u00acP \u2228 Q) = F \u2228 F = F\n- (\u00acQ) = T\n- Therefore, (F) \u2227 (T) = F\n\nAgain, the proposition is false.\n\n**Case 3: P = F, Q = T**\n\n- \u00acP = T\n- Q = T\n- \u00acQ = F\n- So, (\u00acP \u2228 Q) = T \u2228 T = T\n- (\u00acQ) = F\n- Therefore, (T) \u2227 (F) = F\n\nStill, the proposition is false.\n\n**Case 4: P = F, Q = F**\n\n- \u00acP = T\n- Q = F\n- \u00acQ = T\n- So, (\u00acP \u2228 Q) = T \u2228 F = T\n- (\u00acQ) = T\n- Therefore, (T) \u2227 (T) = T\n\nHere, the proposition is true.\n\nSo, in the fourth case, when P is false and Q is false, the entire proposition is true. That means there exists at least one assignment where the proposition is true, making it satisfiable.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Sometimes, when dealing with logical equivalences, it's easy to mix up the implications.\n\nI can also approach this by simplifying the proposition further. Starting with (P \u2192 Q) \u2227 (\u00acQ), which is equivalent to (\u00acP \u2228 Q) \u2227 (\u00acQ). Using distributive laws, this becomes (\u00acP \u2227 \u00acQ) \u2228 (Q \u2227 \u00acQ). But Q \u2227 \u00acQ is a contradiction, which is always false. So, we're left with \u00acP \u2227 \u00acQ.\n\nTherefore, the proposition simplifies to \u00acP \u2227 \u00acQ. This means both P and Q must be false for the proposition to be true. So, if P is false and Q is false, the proposition is true. In all other cases, it's false.\n\nThis confirms my earlier conclusion that the proposition is satisfiable because there's an assignment where both P and Q are false, making the proposition true.\n</think>\n\nThe proposition (P \u2192 Q) \u2227 (\u00acQ) is satisfiable because when P is false and Q is false, the proposition holds true.\n\nThe steps show that evaluating all possible truth assignments reveals the proposition is true only when both P and Q are false.

Carefully analyze the proposition using logical equivalences and truth values. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this logical proposition to analyze: (P \u2192 Q) \u2227 (\u00acQ). I need to figure out if it's satisfiable or unsatisfiable. Let me start by recalling what satisfiable means. If a proposition can be true for some truth values of the variables involved, then it's satisfiable. If it's always false no matter what truth values P and Q take, then it's unsatisfiable.\n\nFirst, let's break down the proposition into its components. There's a conjunction (\u2228) of two parts: (P \u2192 Q) and (\u00acQ). So both of these parts need to be true for the entire proposition to be true.\n\nI know that P \u2192 Q is equivalent to \u00acP \u2228 Q. So, substituting that in, the proposition becomes (\u00acP \u2228 Q) \u2227 (\u00acQ). Let me write that down: (\u00acP \u2228 Q) \u2227 (\u00acQ).\n\nNow, I can distribute the conjunction over the disjunction. So, (\u00acP \u2228 Q) \u2227 (\u00acQ) is equivalent to \u00acP \u2227 (Q \u2227 \u00acQ). Wait, hold on. Q \u2227 \u00acQ is a contradiction, right? Because Q can only be true or false. If Q is true, \u00acQ is false, and if Q is false, \u00acQ is true. So, Q \u2227 \u00acQ is always false. That means \u00acP \u2227 (something always false). So, regardless of the truth value of P, the entire expression becomes false.\n\nLet me double-check that. If Q is true, then \u00acQ is false, so Q \u2227 \u00acQ is false. If Q is false, then \u00acQ is true, but Q is still false, so again, Q \u2227 \u00acQ is false. So in both cases, Q \u2227 \u00acQ is false. Therefore, \u00acP \u2227 false is false. So the entire proposition is false.\n\nWait, but is that always the case? Let me consider all possible truth values for P and Q.\n\nCase 1: P is true, Q is true.\n- (P \u2192 Q) is true because if P is true and Q is true, then P implies Q is true.\n- \u00acQ is false.\n- So, (true) \u2227 (false) is false.\n\nCase 2: P is true, Q is false.\n- (P \u2192 Q) is false because P is true and Q is false, so P implies Q is false.\n- \u00acQ is true.\n- (false) \u2227 (true) is false.\n\nCase 3: P is false, Q is true.\n- (P \u2192 Q) is true because if P is false, then P implies Q is true regardless of Q.\n- \u00acQ is false.\n- (true) \u2227 (false) is false.\n\nCase 4: P is false, Q is false.\n- (P \u2192 Q) is true because P is false, so P implies Q is true.\n- \u00acQ is true.\n- (true) \u2227 (true) is true.\n\nWait a minute, in the last case, when P is false and Q is false, the proposition becomes (true) \u2227 (true), which is true. So that means there is at least one assignment where the proposition is true. Therefore, it's satisfiable.\n\nBut earlier, when I did the logical equivalence, I thought it was always false. So there must be a mistake in my earlier reasoning. Let me go back.\n\nI had (P \u2192 Q) \u2227 (\u00acQ) which became (\u00acP \u2228 Q) \u2227 (\u00acQ). Then I distributed it as \u00acP \u2227 (Q \u2227 \u00acQ). But wait, is that correct? Actually, no. The correct distribution is (A \u2227 B) = (A \u2227 B), but when you have (A \u2228 B) \u2227 C, it's equal to (A \u2227 C) \u2228 (B \u2227 C). So, (\u00acP \u2228 Q) \u2227 (\u00acQ) is equal to (\u00acP \u2227 \u00acQ) \u2228 (Q \u2227 \u00acQ).\n\nNow, Q \u2227 \u00acQ is a contradiction, which is always false. So, the entire expression becomes (\u00acP \u2227 \u00acQ) \u2228 false, which is equivalent to \u00acP \u2227 \u00acQ. So, the proposition simplifies to \u00acP \u2227 \u00acQ.\n\nWait, that's different from what I thought earlier. So, \u00acP \u2227 \u00acQ is equivalent to (\u00acP \u2228 Q) \u2227 \u00acQ, which is the original proposition. So, now, \u00acP \u2227 \u00acQ is the simplified form. So, the proposition is equivalent to both P and Q being false.\n\nSo, when is \u00acP \u2227 \u00acQ true? Only when P is false and Q is false. So, in that case, the proposition is true. Therefore, it is satisfiable because there exists an assignment where both P and Q are false.\n\nEarlier, I thought that Q \u2227 \u00acQ was always false, but I forgot that when you distribute the conjunction over the disjunction, the structure changes. So, it's not that the entire expression is always false, but that the simplified form is \u00acP \u2227 \u00acQ, which can be true when both P and Q are false.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the proposition (P \u2192 Q) \u2227 (\u00acQ) is satisfiable because when P is false and Q is false, the proposition holds true.\n</think>\n\nThe proposition (P \u2192 Q) \u2227 (\u00acQ) simplifies to \u00acP \u2227 \u00acQ. This is true only when both P and Q are false. Therefore, it is satisfiable.\n\nDONE."

Carefully analyze the proposition using logical equivalences and truth values. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this logical proposition: (P \u2192 Q) \u2227 (\u00acQ). I need to figure out if it's satisfiable or unsatisfiable. Hmm, let me break it down.\n\nFirst, I remember that P \u2192 Q is equivalent to \u00acP \u2228 Q. So, let me rewrite the proposition using that equivalence. That gives me (\u00acP \u2228 Q) \u2227 (\u00acQ). \n\nNow, I can distribute the conjunction over the disjunction. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again. Actually, the distributive law for \u2227 over \u2228 is \u00acP \u2228 (Q \u2227 \u00acQ). But Q \u2227 \u00acQ is always false because a statement can't be both true and false at the same time. So, Q \u2227 \u00acQ is a contradiction, which is always false.\n\nSo, now the proposition simplifies to \u00acP \u2228 F, where F is false. Since \u00acP \u2228 F is equivalent to \u00acP, because adding a false doesn't change the truth value. So, the entire proposition reduces to \u00acP.\n\nTherefore, the original proposition (P \u2192 Q) \u2227 (\u00acQ) is equivalent to \u00acP. Now, is \u00acP satisfiable? Well, \u00acP can be true if P is false. So, if I assign P to be false and Q to be anything, the proposition holds. \n\nFor example, let's say P is false and Q is true. Then, P \u2192 Q is true because a false statement implies anything is true. And \u00acQ is false. So, (true) \u2227 (false) is false. Wait, that's not satisfying the proposition. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in my equivalence.\n\nWait, let's double-check. If P is false, then P \u2192 Q is true regardless of Q. So, (P \u2192 Q) is true, and \u00acQ is... If Q is true, then \u00acQ is false. So, the conjunction is true \u2227 false, which is false. If Q is false, then \u00acQ is true. So, true \u2227 true is true. \n\nAh, so when P is false, depending on Q, the proposition can be either true or false. But wait, earlier I thought it simplifies to \u00acP, which would mean it's always false when P is false. But that doesn't align with this example where P is false and Q is false, making the proposition true.\n\nSo, maybe my equivalence step was incorrect. Let me go back. The original proposition is (P \u2192 Q) \u2227 (\u00acQ). Let's construct a truth table to analyze it properly.\n\nThere are two variables, P and Q, so four possible combinations:\n\n1. P = true, Q = true:\n   - P \u2192 Q: true\n   - \u00acQ: false\n   - (true) \u2227 (false): false\n\n2. P = true, Q = false:\n   - P \u2192 Q: false\n   - \u00acQ: true\n   - (false) \u2227 (true): false\n\n3. P = false, Q = true:\n   - P \u2192 Q: true\n   - \u00acQ: false\n   - (true) \u2227 (false): false\n\n4. P = false, Q = false:\n   - P \u2192 Q: true\n   - \u00acQ: true\n   - (true) \u2227 (true): true\n\nSo, from the truth table, the proposition is true only when P is false and Q is false. Therefore, it's satisfiable because there's at least one truth assignment where it's true (P=F, Q=F).\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it simplifies to \u00acP, which would mean it's always false when P is false, but that's not the case. So, my initial equivalence was wrong. It's better to rely on the truth table for accuracy.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the proposition is satisfiable because there exists an assignment (P=F, Q=F) where it's true.\n</think>\n\nThe compound logical proposition (P \u2192 Q) \u2227 (\u00acQ) is satisfiable. \n\nTo determine this, we analyzed the truth values for all possible combinations of P and Q:\n\n1. P = true, Q = true: (true) \u2227 (false) = false\n2. P = true, Q = false: (false) \u2227 (true) = false\n3. P = false, Q = true: (true) \u2227 (false) = false\n4.
