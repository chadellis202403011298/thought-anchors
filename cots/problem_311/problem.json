  "question": "Consider the following compound logical proposition: (P \u2192 Q) \u2227 (\u00acQ). Determine whether this proposition is satisfiable (can be true for some assignment of truth values to P and Q) or unsatisfiable (always false regardless of the truth values of P and Q). Carefully analyze the proposition using logical equivalences and truth values.",
  "answer": "To determine if the proposition (P \u2192 Q) \u2227 (\u00acQ) is satisfiable, I'll analyze it step by step:\n\n1) First, let's recall that P \u2192 Q is logically equivalent to \u00acP \u2228 Q\n\n2) So our proposition becomes: (\u00acP \u2228 Q) \u2227 (\u00acQ)\n\n3) Using the distributive property: (\u00acP \u2227 \u00acQ) \u2228 (Q \u2227 \u00acQ)\n\n4) Since Q \u2227 \u00acQ is a contradiction (always false), this simplifies to: (\u00acP \u2227 \u00acQ) \u2228 False = \u00acP \u2227 \u00acQ\n\n5) This means our original proposition (P \u2192 Q) \u2227 (\u00acQ) is logically equivalent to \u00acP \u2227 \u00acQ\n\n6) The expression \u00acP \u2227 \u00acQ is true when P is false and Q is false\n\n7) Therefore, the proposition is satisfiable, specifically when P = false and Q = false.\n\nAlternatively, we could have created a truth table:\nWhen Q is false, \u00acQ is true\nWhen Q is false, P \u2192 Q is true only when P is also false\nSo when P = false and Q = false, (P \u2192 Q) \u2227 (\u00acQ) evaluates to true \u2227 true = true\n\nThe proposition is satisfiable with the assignment P = false, Q = false."
