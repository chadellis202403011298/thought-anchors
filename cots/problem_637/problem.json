  "question": "A biologist observes that certain plants grow taller near a lake compared to the same species growing farther away from the lake. The biologist proposes that the increased height is due to higher water availability. To properly develop this into a scientific theory, which of the following steps would be most appropriate to take next?\n\nA) Immediately publish the observation as a confirmed theory\nB) Formulate a testable hypothesis and design an experiment to measure plant growth with controlled water availability\nC) Apply the findings to all plant species globally\nD) Conclude that all environmental differences between locations must be due to water availability",
  "answer": "The correct answer is B) Formulate a testable hypothesis and design an experiment to measure plant growth with controlled water availability.\n\nReasoning through the options:\n\nA) Immediately publishing an observation as a confirmed theory skips several crucial steps in the scientific method. A single observation is not sufficient to establish a theory.\n\nB) This is the correct next step in theory development. The biologist has made an observation and proposed a potential explanation (increased water availability). The scientific method requires that this potential explanation be formulated as a testable hypothesis and then subjected to controlled experimentation. By designing an experiment where water availability is the only variable that changes, the biologist can test whether water truly is the causal factor for increased plant height.\n\nC) Applying findings to all plant species globally would be an inappropriate overgeneralization. The observation was made on specific plant species in a specific location, and extrapolating to all plants without further evidence would not be scientifically sound.\n\nD) Concluding that all environmental differences are due to water availability is an unjustified leap in reasoning. Many other factors (soil nutrients, sunlight, temperature, etc.) could explain environmental differences.\n\nOption B represents the proper progression in scientific theory development: observation \u2192 potential explanation \u2192 testable hypothesis \u2192 controlled experimentation."
