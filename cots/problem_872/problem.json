  "question": "You have only a compass and a straightedge (unmarked ruler). Construct a square given only a single line segment AB that will be one side of the square. Describe the step-by-step process that would allow you to complete this construction without any measurements.",
  "answer": "Step 1: Start with the given line segment AB, which will be one side of our square.\n\nStep 2: Using the compass, set its width to the length of AB. Place the compass point at A and draw an arc above the line.\n\nStep 3: Without changing the compass width, place the compass point at B and draw another arc that intersects with the first arc. Label this intersection point C.\n\nStep 4: Draw straight lines from A to C and from B to C using the straightedge. This creates an equilateral triangle ABC.\n\nStep 5: Using the compass, set its width to the length of AB again. Place the compass at C and draw an arc that passes through A and B. This arc will be part of a circle centered at C with radius equal to AB.\n\nStep 6: Place the compass point at A and draw an arc perpendicular to AB. Then place the compass point at B and draw another arc perpendicular to AB. These two arcs should intersect at a point D, which is directly perpendicular to AB.\n\nStep 7: Draw straight lines from A to D and from B to D using the straightedge. This creates a square ADBE, where E is the fourth vertex.\n\nStep 8: To verify: The construction ensures all sides are equal (all have length AB), and all angles are right angles due to the perpendicular construction method.\n\nThe square ABDE is now complete, with AB as one of its sides."
