Then, calculate the output for the input value 20.",
  "answer": "To induce the rule from the given examples, I'll analyze the relationship between each input and its corresponding output:\n\nInput = 2, Output = 5\nInput = 5, Output = 14\nInput = 8, Output = 23\nInput = 11, Output = 32\nInput = 14, Output = 41\n\nI notice that the inputs increase by 3 each time: 2, 5, 8, 11, 14\n\nLet me try to find a mathematical formula that relates each input to its output:\n\nFor input 2: 2 \u00d7 2 + 1 = 5\nFor input 5: 5 \u00d7 3 - 1 = 14\nFor input 8: 8 \u00d7 3 - 1 = 23\nFor input 11: 11 \u00d7 3 - 1 = 32\nFor input 14: 14 \u00d7 3 - 1 = 41\n\nI can see that except for the first example, all other examples follow the pattern:\nOutput = Input \u00d7 3 - 1\n\nThe first example might be different because it's establishing the pattern, or it follows a different initial rule.\n\nTo verify the formula, let's double-check the examples:\n5 \u00d7 3 - 1 = 15 - 1 = 14 \u2713\n8 \u00d7 3 - 1 = 24 - 1 = 23 \u2713\n11 \u00d7 3 - 1 = 33 - 1 = 32 \u2713\n14 \u00d7 3 - 1 = 42 - 1 = 41 \u2713\n\nThus, the rule appears to be: Output = Input \u00d7 3 - 1\n\nNow, for the input value 20:\nOutput = 20 \u00d7 3 - 1 = 60 - 1 = 59\n\nTherefore, the output for the input value 20 is 59."
