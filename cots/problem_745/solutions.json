Then, calculate the output for the input value 20. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I've got this sequence of transformations here, and I need to figure out the rule that turns the input into the output. Let me write them down again to see the pattern more clearly:\n\nInput \u2192 Output\n2 \u2192 5\n5 \u2192 14\n8 \u2192 23\n11 \u2192 32\n14 \u2192 41\n\nHmm, okay, let's start by looking at the differences between the inputs and outputs to see if that helps.\n\nFor the first pair:\n2 \u2192 5\nSo, 5 - 2 = 3\n\nSecond pair:\n5 \u2192 14\n14 - 5 = 9\n\nThird pair:\n8 \u2192 23\n23 - 8 = 15\n\nFourth pair:\n11 \u2192 32\n32 - 11 = 21\n\nFifth pair:\n14 \u2192 41\n41 - 14 = 27\n\nAlright, so the differences between the inputs and outputs are: 3, 9, 15, 21, 27.\n\nWait a minute, those differences look familiar. They seem to be increasing by 6 each time. Let me check:\n\n3, then 3 + 6 = 9, then 9 + 6 = 15, then 15 + 6 = 21, then 21 + 6 = 27. Yep, that's consistent.\n\nSo, it seems like each output is the input plus an incrementing multiple of 6. Let me see if I can generalize this.\n\nLooking at the first difference, 3, which is 6 * 0.5. Hmm, not a whole number. Maybe it's not exactly that.\n\nWait, let me think differently. The differences are 3, 9, 15, 21, 27. These are all multiples of 3. Specifically, 3*1, 3*3, 3*5, 3*7, 3*9. So the multiplier is increasing by 2 each time: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9.\n\nOh, so the difference between the input and output is 3 times the odd numbers. That makes sense because the differences are 3, 9, 15, etc., which are 3*(2n-1) where n starts from 1.\n\nSo, the rule could be: Output = Input + 3*(2n - 1), where n is the position in the sequence.\n\nBut let me test this with the given examples to make sure.\n\nFirst pair: n=1\nOutput = 2 + 3*(2*1 - 1) = 2 + 3*1 = 5. Correct.\n\nSecond pair: n=2\nOutput = 5 + 3*(2*2 - 1) = 5 + 3*3 = 5 + 9 = 14. Correct.\n\nThird pair: n=3\nOutput = 8 + 3*(2*3 - 1) = 8 + 3*5 = 8 + 15 = 23. Correct.\n\nFourth pair: n=4\nOutput = 11 + 3*(2*4 - 1) = 11 + 3*7 = 11 + 21 = 32. Correct.\n\nFifth pair: n=5\nOutput = 14 + 3*(2*5 - 1) = 14 + 3*9 = 14 + 27 = 41. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the formula seems to hold.\n\nNow, I need to apply this rule to find the output when the input is 20.\n\nFirst, I need to determine what position n is in the sequence when the input is 20.\n\nLooking at the sequence of inputs: 2, 5, 8, 11, 14.\n\nSo, starting from 2, each subsequent input increases by 3: 2, 5 (2+3), 8 (5+3), 11 (8+3), 14 (11+3).\n\nSo, it's an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 3.\n\nGiven that, I can find the position n for input=20.\n\nThe first term a1=2, common difference d=3.\n\nThe nth term of an arithmetic sequence is given by a_n = a1 + (n-1)*d.\n\nWe have a_n = 20.\n\nSo, 20 = 2 + (n-1)*3\n\nSubtract 2 from both sides: 18 = (n-1)*3\n\nDivide both sides by 3: 6 = n - 1\n\nSo, n = 7.\n\nWait, that means when the input is 20, it's the 7th term in the sequence.\n\nBut let's check the previous terms to make sure.\n\nTerm 1: 2\n\nTerm 2: 5\n\nTerm 3: 8\n\nTerm 4: 11\n\nTerm 5: 14\n\nTerm 6: 17\n\nTerm 7: 20\n\nYes, so 20 is indeed the 7th term.\n\nTherefore, n=7.\n\nNow, applying the formula:\n\nOutput = Input + 3*(2n - 1)\n\nSo, Output = 20 + 3*(2*7 - 1) = 20 + 3*(14 - 1) = 20 + 3*13 = 20 + 39 = 59.\n\nLet me double-check this calculation.\n\n2*7=14, 14-1=13, 3*13=39, 20+39=59.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the differences again. The difference for n=7 should be 3*(2*7 - 1)=39, so Output = 20 + 39 = 59.\n\nAnother way to look at it is that each time, the difference increases by 6. The last difference given was 27 (for input=14), so the next difference should be 27 + 6 = 33. So, Output = 14 + 33 = 47. Wait, that contradicts the previous result.\n\nHmm, that's confusing. Where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, let me re-examine the differences.\n\nGiven inputs: 2,5,8,11,14.\n\nDifferences from input to output: 3,9,15,21,27.\n\nSo, the differences increase by 6 each time.\n\nSo, the next difference after 27 should be 27 + 6 = 33.\n\nTherefore, output for input=14 is 41, then next input=17, output=41 + 33=74.\n\nWait, but according to the arithmetic sequence, input=17 is term 6, output=74.\n\nThen input=20 is term 7, output=74 + 39=113? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, I think I'm mixing up the difference and the output.\n\nLet me clarify.\n\nThe differences between inputs and outputs are: 3,9,15,21,27.\n\nThese differences themselves increase by 6 each time.\n\nSo, the first difference is 3, then 9 (3+6), then 15 (9+6), etc.\n\nSo, the next difference after 27 would be 27 + 6 = 33.\n\nTherefore, the next output after 41 is 41 + 33 = 74.\n\nBut according to the arithmetic sequence, after 14, the next input is 17, so the output should be 74.\n\nBut earlier, using the formula, I got 59 for input=20.\n\nWait, that's a problem.\n\nSo, there's an inconsistency here. I need to resolve this.\n\nLet me see.\n\nIf I consider the differences as increasing by 6, then:\n\nInput=2, Output=5 (difference=3)\n\nInput=5, Output=14 (difference=9)\n\nInput=8, Output=23 (difference=15)\n\nInput=11, Output=32 (difference=21)\n\nInput=14, Output=41 (difference=27)\n\nSo, next difference should be 27 + 6 = 33.\n\nThus, next output would be 41 + 33 = 74.\n\nBut according to the arithmetic sequence of inputs, the next input after 14 is 17, and according to the previous pattern, the output for 17 should be 74.\n\nBut when I calculated using the formula Output = Input + 3*(2n - 1), where n=7, I got 59.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in determining n.\n\nLet me recount.\n\nInputs: 2,5,8,11,14.\n\nSo, 2 is term 1.\n\n5 is term 2.\n\n8 is term 3.\n\n11 is term 4.\n\n14 is term 5.\n\nSo, 20 is term 6.\n\nWait, earlier I thought 20 is term 7, but that's incorrect.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nTerm 1: 2\n\nTerm 2: 5 (2+3)\n\nTerm 3: 8 (5+3)\n\nTerm 4: 11 (8+3)\n\nTerm 5:14 (11+3)\n\nTerm 6:17 (14+3)\n\nTerm 7:20 (17+3)\n\nYes, so 20 is term 7.\n\nSo, n=7.\n\nThus, Output = 20 + 3*(2*7 -1) = 20 + 3*13 = 20 +39=59.\n\nBut according to the differences, the next output after 41 should be 74, which would correspond to input=17, output=74.\n\nSo, input=17, output=74.\n\nThen input=20, output=74 + (difference increases by 6 each time).\n\nWait, the differences are:3,9,15,21,27,33,39,...\n\nSo, for input=17, difference=33, output=14 +33=47? Wait, no.\n\nWait, the outputs are:5,14,23,32,41,...\n\nSo, output for input=5 is 14.\n\nOutput for input=8 is 23.\n\nOutput for input=11 is 32.\n\nOutput for input=14 is 41.\n\nSo, the outputs are increasing by 9,15,21,27,...\n\nSo, for input=17, the output should be 41 + 33=74.\n\nThen for input=20, output=74 + 39=113.\n\nWait, now I'm confused because two different methods are giving different results.\n\nI need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nLet me go back to the original data.\n\nGiven inputs:2,5,8,11,14.\n\nOutputs:5,14,23,32,41.\n\nSo, the outputs are:\n\n5=2+3\n\n14=5+9\n\n23=8+15\n\n32=11+21\n\n41=14+27\n\nSo, the differences between outputs and inputs are:3,9,15,21,27.\n\nThese differences increase by 6 each time.\n\nSo, the next difference after 27 is 33.\n\nTherefore, output for input=14 is 41, so output for input=17 should be 41 +33=74.\n\nSimilarly, output for input=20 would be 74 +39=113.\n\nBut according to the formula Output=Input +3*(2n-1), where n is the term number, starting at 1.\n\nSo, for term 1:2 +3*(2*1 -1)=2+3=5\n\nTerm 2:5 +3*(4-1)=5+9=14\n\nTerm3:8 +3*(6-1)=8+15=23\n\nTerm4:11 +3*(8-1)=11+21=32\n\nTerm5:14 +3*(10-1)=14+27=41\n\nTerm6:17 +3*(12-1)=17+33=50\n\nWait, that's different. According to this, input=17, output=50.\n\nBut earlier, based on differences, I thought output=74.\n\nSo, there's a conflict.\n\nThis suggests that my initial assumption about the formula might be incorrect.\n\nPerhaps the rule isn't Output=Input +3*(2n-1). Maybe it's something else.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nLooking at the outputs:5,14,23,32,41.\n\nWhat's the pattern here?\n\nLet me see the differences between consecutive outputs.\n\n14-5=9\n\n23-14=9\n\n32-23=9\n\n41-32=9\n\nSo, the outputs themselves increase by 9 each time.\n\nWait, that's interesting.\n\nSo, the outputs form an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 9.\n\nSimilarly, the inputs:2,5,8,11,14 also form an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 3.\n\nSo, perhaps the rule is that each output is the previous output plus 9.\n\nBut that would mean the output for input=20 would be the next term after 41, which is 50.\n\nBut earlier, when I calculated using the differences, I thought it should be 74.\n\nThis is conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that each output is equal to the input plus some function.\n\nLooking at the outputs:\n\n5=2+3\n\n14=5+9\n\n23=8+15\n\n32=11+21\n\n41=14+27\n\nSo, the added numbers are 3,9,15,21,27, which are multiples of 3, increasing by 6 each time.\n\nSo, the added number is 3*(2k-1), where k is the term number.\n\nWait, for the first term, k=1:3*(2*1-1)=3*1=3.\n\nSecond term, k=2:3*(4-1)=9.\n\nThird term, k=3:3*(6-1)=15.\n\nYes, that matches.\n\nSo, Output=Input +3*(2k-1), where k is the term number.\n\nBut earlier, when I tried to apply this to input=20, which is term 7, I got Output=20+3*(14-1)=20+39=59.\n\nBut if the outputs themselves form an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 9, then starting from 41, the next output should be 50, then 59, etc.\n\nWait, so let's see:\n\nOutputs:5,14,23,32,41,50,59,...\n\nSo, for input=17, output=50.\n\nFor input=20, output=59.\n\nBut earlier, when I considered the differences between outputs, I thought that the next output after 41 would be 74, but that's incorrect.\n\nBecause the outputs themselves increase by 9 each time.\n\nSo, the correct progression is 5,14,23,32,41,50,59,...\n\nTherefore, for input=20, output=59.\n\nSo, why did I earlier think it was 74?\n\nBecause I mistakenly thought that the differences between outputs increase by 6 each time, but actually, the outputs themselves increase by a constant 9.\n\nSo, the correct output for input=20 is 59.\n\nTherefore, the rule is that each output is the input plus 3*(2k-1), where k is the term number.\n\nSo, for input=20, which is term 7, Output=20 + 3*(14-1)=20+39=59.\n\nAlternatively, since the outputs increase by 9, starting from 5, the nth output is 5 + 9*(n-1).\n\nFor n=1, 5 +0=5.\n\nn=2,5+9=14.\n\nn=3,5+18=23.\n\nYes, that works.\n\nSo, the output for term k is 5 +9*(k-1).\n\nBut the input for term k is 2 +3*(k-1).\n\nSo, we can express the output in terms of the input.\n\nLet me see:\n\nInput=2 +3*(k-1).\n\nOutput=5 +9*(k-1).\n\nSo, Output=5 +9*(k-1).\n\nBut Input=2 +3*(k-1).\n\nLet me solve for k in terms of Input.\n\nInput=2 +3*(k-1)\n\nSo, Input-2=3*(k-1)\n\nDivide by 3: (Input-2)/3 =k-1\n\nSo, k= (Input-2)/3 +1= (Input-2 +3)/3= (Input+1)/3.\n\nTherefore, k=(Input+1)/3.\n\nNow, substitute into Output=5 +9*(k-1).\n\nSo, Output=5 +9*((Input+1)/3 -1)=5 +9*((Input+1 -3)/3)=5 +9*((Input-2)/3).\n\nSimplify: 5 +3*(Input-2)=5 +3Input -6=3Input -1.\n\nSo, Output=3Input -1.\n\nWait, that's a simpler formula.\n\nLet me test this with the given examples.\n\nFor input=2: 3*2 -1=6-1=5. Correct.\n\nInput=5:15-1=14. Correct.\n\nInput=8:24-1=23. Correct.\n\nInput=11:33-1=32. Correct.\n\nInput=14:42-1=41. Correct.\n\nYes, this formula works.\n\nSo, the rule is Output=3*Input -1.\n\nTherefore, for input=20, Output=3*20 -1=60-1=59.\n\nSo, the output is 59.\n\nI think earlier confusion was due to considering the differences between outputs as increasing, but actually, the outputs themselves increase by a constant 9, leading to a simpler linear relationship: Output=3Input -1.\n</think>\n\nThe rule transforming the input into the output is Output = 3 \u00d7 Input - 1. Applying this to an input of 20:\n\nOutput = 3 \u00d7 20 - 1 = 60 - 1 = 59.\n\n**Answer:** 59\n\nDONE."

Then, calculate the output for the input value 20. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I've got this problem here where I need to figure out the rule that transforms an input number into an output number based on a given sequence. Then, I have to apply that rule to find out what the output would be for an input of 20. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me list out the given transformations to get a clear picture:\n\nInput \u2192 Output\n2 \u2192 5\n5 \u2192 14\n8 \u2192 23\n11 \u2192 32\n14 \u2192 41\n\nOkay, so each input number is being transformed into a specific output number. My goal is to find the pattern or rule that connects the input to the output.\n\nLet me start by looking at the differences between the inputs and outputs to see if that reveals anything.\n\nStarting with the first pair:\n- Input: 2\n- Output: 5\nThe difference here is 5 - 2 = 3.\n\nNext pair:\n- Input: 5\n- Output: 14\nDifference: 14 - 5 = 9.\n\nThird pair:\n- Input: 8\n- Output: 23\nDifference: 23 - 8 = 15.\n\nFourth pair:\n- Input: 11\n- Output: 32\nDifference: 32 - 11 = 21.\n\nFifth pair:\n- Input: 14\n- Output: 41\nDifference: 41 - 14 = 27.\n\nHmm, so the differences between the outputs and inputs are: 3, 9, 15, 21, 27.\n\nWait a minute, those differences themselves form a sequence. Let me note them down:\n\n3, 9, 15, 21, 27.\n\nLooking at these, I can see that each number increases by 6 each time. Let's check:\n\n9 - 3 = 6\n15 - 9 = 6\n21 - 15 = 6\n27 - 21 = 6\n\nYes, so the differences between the differences are constant, meaning this is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 6. That suggests that the rule might involve some kind of quadratic relationship because the second differences are constant, which is a characteristic of quadratic functions.\n\nSo, if the second differences are constant, the function could be quadratic, meaning it could be of the form f(n) = an\u00b2 + bn + c, where a, b, c are constants to be determined.\n\nBut before jumping into quadratic functions, maybe there's a simpler pattern. Let me look at the outputs and see if they relate to the inputs in a specific way.\n\nLooking at the outputs: 5, 14, 23, 32, 41.\n\nI notice that these numbers are all one less than multiples of 10:\n\n5 = 6 - 1\n14 = 15 - 1\n23 = 24 - 1\n32 = 33 - 1\n41 = 42 - 1\n\nWait, but 5 is also 5, which is a prime number, but that doesn't seem directly related. Alternatively, looking at the outputs as they relate to the inputs:\n\nLet's see if the outputs can be expressed in terms of the inputs plus some function.\n\nFrom the first pair:\n5 = 2 + 3\n3 is the first difference.\n\nSecond pair:\n14 = 5 + 9\nThird pair:\n23 = 8 + 15\nFourth pair:\n32 = 11 + 21\nFifth pair:\n41 = 14 + 27\n\nSo, the output is the input plus a value that increases by 6 each time. That is, the added value is 3, 9, 15, 21, 27, which are multiples of 3.\n\nBut since the added value increases by 6 each time, that's a linear increase. So, the added value can be represented as 3 + 6*(n-1), where n is the position in the sequence.\n\nBut how does that help me find the output for a given input? Maybe I need to model this as a quadratic function because the second differences are constant.\n\nLet me assume that the output is a quadratic function of the input, so:\n\nOutput = a*(Input)^2 + b*(Input) + c\n\nI need to find a, b, and c such that the given pairs satisfy this equation.\n\nLet's set up equations using the first three pairs.\n\nFor Input=2:\n5 = a*(2)^2 + b*(2) + c\n5 = 4a + 2b + c  --> Equation 1\n\nFor Input=5:\n14 = a*(5)^2 + b*(5) + c\n14 = 25a + 5b + c  --> Equation 2\n\nFor Input=8:\n23 = a*(8)^2 + b*(8) + c\n23 = 64a + 8b + c  --> Equation 3\n\nNow, I have three equations:\n\n1) 4a + 2b + c = 5\n2) 25a + 5b + c = 14\n3) 64a + 8b + c = 23\n\nLet me subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2 to eliminate c:\n\n(25a + 5b + c) - (4a + 2b + c) = 14 - 5\n21a + 3b = 9 --> Simplify by dividing by 3:\n7a + b = 3  --> Equation 4\n\nSimilarly, subtract Equation 2 from Equation 3:\n\n(64a + 8b + c) - (25a + 5b + c) = 23 - 14\n39a + 3b = 9 --> Simplify by dividing by 3:\n13a + b = 3  --> Equation 5\n\nNow, subtract Equation 4 from Equation 5:\n\n(13a + b) - (7a + b) = 3 - 3\n6a = 0 --> a = 0\n\nWait, if a=0, that would make the quadratic function linear. Let's see if that works.\n\nFrom Equation 4: 7a + b = 3\nSince a=0, then b=3.\n\nNow, substitute a=0 and b=3 into Equation 1:\n\n4*0 + 2*3 + c = 5\n0 + 6 + c = 5\nc = 5 - 6\nc = -1\n\nSo, the function would be Output = 0*(Input)^2 + 3*(Input) - 1 = 3*Input -1\n\nLet's test this with the given pairs.\n\nFor Input=2: 3*2 -1 = 6 -1 =5 \u2714\ufe0f\nInput=5: 15 -1=14 \u2714\ufe0f\nInput=8:24 -1=23 \u2714\ufe0f\nInput=11:33 -1=32 \u2714\ufe0f\nInput=14:42 -1=41 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWow, it works for all the given pairs. So, the rule is simply Output = 3*Input -1.\n\nTherefore, to find the output for Input=20:\n\nOutput = 3*20 -1 = 60 -1 =59.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check using the differences approach to ensure consistency.\n\nEarlier, I noticed that the differences between outputs and inputs are 3,9,15,21,27, which are multiples of 3, increasing by 6 each time. So, for the nth term, the difference would be 3 + 6*(n-1).\n\nBut according to the quadratic function we found, Output = 3*Input -1.\n\nAlternatively, since Output = 3*Input -1, the difference between Output and Input is 2*Input -1.\n\nWait, that doesn't align with the differences we calculated earlier. Let me reconcile this.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming the quadratic function. Because when I calculated the differences between outputs and inputs, I saw they increase by 6 each time, which suggests a quadratic relationship. But when I forced a quadratic function, it turned out that a=0, making it linear. That seems contradictory.\n\nWait, let me double-check the quadratic approach.\n\nIf the second differences are constant, the function should be quadratic. However, in this case, the second differences are constant at 6, which would suggest that the function is quadratic.\n\nBut when I set up the equations, I ended up with a=0, implying a linear function. That suggests that perhaps the second differences aren't constant, but I thought they were.\n\nWait, let's recalculate the second differences.\n\nFirst differences (outputs - inputs):\n\n5-2=3\n\n14-5=9\n\n23-8=15\n\n32-11=21\n\n41-14=27\n\nNow, the first differences are 3,9,15,21,27.\n\nThe second differences would be the differences between these:\n\n9-3=6\n\n15-9=6\n\n21-15=6\n\n27-21=6\n\nSo, the second differences are constant at 6, which is characteristic of a quadratic function.\n\nBut when I set up the quadratic function, I ended up with a=0, which is linear. That's conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the equations.\n\nLet me go back.\n\nAssuming Output = a*Input\u00b2 + b*Input + c.\n\nUsing Input=2, Output=5:\n\n5 = a*(4) + b*(2) + c --> 4a + 2b + c =5 --> Equation 1\n\nInput=5, Output=14:\n\n14 = a*25 + b*5 + c --> 25a +5b +c=14 --> Equation 2\n\nInput=8, Output=23:\n\n23 = a*64 + b*8 + c --> 64a +8b +c=23 --> Equation 3\n\nSubtract Equation 1 from Equation 2:\n\n25a +5b +c - (4a +2b +c) =14-5\n21a +3b=9 --> 7a + b=3 --> Equation 4\n\nSubtract Equation 2 from Equation 3:\n\n64a +8b +c - (25a +5b +c)=23-14\n39a +3b=9 --> 13a + b=3 --> Equation 5\n\nNow, subtract Equation 4 from Equation 5:\n\n13a + b - (7a +b)=3-3\n6a=0 --> a=0\n\nSo, a=0, then from Equation 4: 7*0 +b=3 --> b=3\n\nThen from Equation 1: 4*0 +2*3 +c=5 --> 6 +c=5 --> c= -1\n\nSo, Output=0*Input\u00b2 +3*Input -1=3*Input -1\n\nBut if Output=3*Input -1, then the relationship is linear, not quadratic. So, the second differences should be constant only if it's quadratic. But in this case, it's linear, which doesn't have constant second differences. Hmm, that's confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the rule isn't quadratic after all, but linear. Let me think differently.\n\nLooking back at the outputs:5,14,23,32,41.\n\nI notice that these numbers are all one less than multiples of 10: 5=6-1,14=15-1,23=24-1, etc.\n\nBut that's just a coincidence, I think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the input multiplied by 3 minus 1, as we found earlier.\n\nBut let's see if there's another pattern. Maybe the output is related to the sum of the input and something else.\n\nFor example:\n\n5=2+3\n\n14=5+9\n\n23=8+15\n\n32=11+21\n\n41=14+27\n\nSo, each time, we're adding a multiple of 3. The added values are 3,9,15,21,27, which are 3*(1,3,5,7,9).\n\nSo, the added term is 3*(2n-1), where n is the position in the sequence.\n\nWait, let's test that.\n\nFor n=1: 3*(2*1 -1)=3*1=3, which matches the first addition.\n\nn=2:3*(4-1)=9, which matches.\n\nn=3:3*(6-1)=15, yes.\n\nn=4:3*(8-1)=21, yes.\n\nn=5:3*(10-1)=27, yes.\n\nSo, the added term for the nth input is 3*(2n -1).\n\nBut the nth input is 2,5,8,11,14,...\n\nWait, the input sequence is starting at 2 and increasing by 3 each time.\n\nSo, input sequence:2,5,8,11,14,...\n\nWhich can be expressed as 3n -1, where n starts at 1.\n\nSo, for n=1:3*1 -1=2\n\nn=2:3*2 -1=5\n\nn=3:3*3 -1=8\n\nYes, that works.\n\nSo, if the input is 3n -1, then the added term is 3*(2n -1).\n\nTherefore, Output = Input + 3*(2n -1)\n\nBut since Input =3n -1,\n\nOutput = (3n -1) + 3*(2n -1) = 3n -1 +6n -3=9n -4.\n\nWait, so Output=9n -4.\n\nLet me test this.\n\nFor n=1:9*1 -4=5 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2:18-4=14 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3:27-4=23 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4:36-4=32 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5:45-4=41 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that works.\n\nSo, Output=9n -4, where n is the position in the sequence.\n\nBut the problem is, the input is given as 20, and I need to find the corresponding output.\n\nBut wait, the input sequence is 2,5,8,11,14,... which is 3n -1.\n\nSo, to find n for a given input, I can solve 3n -1 = input.\n\nSo, for input=20:\n\n3n -1=20\n\n3n=21\n\nn=7\n\nThen, Output=9n -4=9*7 -4=63 -4=59.\n\nSo, the output is 59.\n\nWait, earlier I thought Output=3*Input -1, which for Input=20 would be 59 as well. So, both approaches give the same result, which is reassuring.\n\nTherefore, the rule is Output=3*Input -1, or equivalently, Output=9n -4, where n is the position in the sequence.\n\nSo, for Input=20, the Output is 59.\n</think>\n\nThe pattern in the given sequence is linear, where each output is calculated as 3 times the input minus 1. Therefore, applying this rule to the input value 20:\n\nOutput = 3 * 20 - 1 = 60 - 1 = 59.\n\n**Answer:** 59\n\nDONE."

Then, calculate the output for the input value 20. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I've got this sequence of transformations here, and I need to figure out the rule that converts the input to the output. Let me take it step by step. \n\nFirst, let me list out the given pairs:\n\nInput \u2192 Output\n2 \u2192 5\n5 \u2192 14\n8 \u2192 23\n11 \u2192 32\n14 \u2192 41\n\nHmm, okay, so each input number is being transformed into a higher output number. I need to find out what operation is being done here. Let me look at the differences between the inputs and outputs to see if that helps.\n\nStarting with the first pair: 2 becomes 5. So, 5 minus 2 is 3. Next, 5 becomes 14. 14 minus 5 is 9. Then, 8 becomes 23. 23 minus 8 is 15. Next, 11 becomes 32. 32 minus 11 is 21. Lastly, 14 becomes 41. 41 minus 14 is 27.\n\nSo, the differences between the outputs and inputs are: 3, 9, 15, 21, 27. Hmm, I notice that these differences are increasing by 6 each time: 3, 9 (3+6), 15 (9+6), 21 (15+6), 27 (21+6). That seems consistent. So, each time, the difference increases by 6.\n\nIf that's the case, then the transformation is probably adding a multiple of 6 to the input. Let's test that.\n\nFirst input is 2. If I add 3 (which is 3*1), I get 5, which matches the output. Next, input is 5. If I add 9 (which is 3*3), I get 14. That works. Then, input is 8. Adding 15 (3*5) gives 23. Correct. Next, input is 11. Adding 21 (3*7) gives 32. Right. Lastly, input is 14. Adding 27 (3*9) gives 41. Perfect.\n\nSo, the rule seems to be: for each input number, add 3 times the step number. Wait, but the step number here is the position in the sequence. Let me see.\n\nLooking at the first pair, step 1: 2 + 3*1 = 5.\n\nSecond pair, step 2: 5 + 3*2 = 5 + 6 = 11. Wait, but the output is 14. Hmm, that doesn't add up. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the step number.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's adding 3, then 9, then 15, etc., which are multiples of 3. So, the difference is 3 times the step number. Let me check.\n\nFirst step: 2 + 3*1 = 5.\n\nSecond step: 5 + 3*2 = 5 + 6 = 11. But the output is 14, not 11. Hmm, that's not matching. Maybe the step number is different.\n\nWait, let's see the differences again: 3, 9, 15, 21, 27. These are 3 times 1, 3 times 3, 3 times 5, 3 times 7, 3 times 9. So, the multipliers are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9. That looks like odd numbers. So, the difference is 3 times the odd number corresponding to the step.\n\nSo, for the first pair, step 1: 3*1=3, added to 2 gives 5.\n\nSecond pair, step 2: 3*3=9, added to 5 gives 14.\n\nThird pair, step 3: 3*5=15, added to 8 gives 23.\n\nFourth pair, step 4: 3*7=21, added to 11 gives 32.\n\nFifth pair, step 5: 3*9=27, added to 14 gives 41.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the rule is: for each input number, add 3 times the step number, where the step number is an odd number starting from 1.\n\nAlternatively, the step number could be considered as n, where n is 1,2,3,4,5,... and the multiplier is 3*(2n-1). So, for n=1: 3*(2*1-1)=3*1=3. For n=2: 3*(2*2-1)=3*3=9, and so on.\n\nSo, the formula would be: Output = Input + 3*(2n - 1), where n is the position in the sequence.\n\nBut to confirm, let's see if this holds for all given pairs.\n\nFor n=1: 2 + 3*(2*1 -1) = 2 + 3*1 = 5 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: 5 + 3*(2*2 -1) = 5 + 3*3 = 14 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: 8 + 3*(2*3 -1) = 8 + 3*5 = 23 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: 11 + 3*(2*4 -1) = 11 + 3*7 = 32 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: 14 + 3*(2*5 -1) = 14 + 3*9 = 41 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, that works.\n\nSo, now, to find the output for the input value 20, I need to determine what step n it falls into.\n\nLooking at the sequence of inputs: 2,5,8,11,14,...\n\nThe difference between each input is 3: 5-2=3, 8-5=3, 11-8=3, 14-11=3. So, each input increases by 3.\n\nSo, the inputs form an arithmetic sequence starting at 2 with a common difference of 3. So, the nth input is 2 + 3*(n-1).\n\nSo, for n=1: 2\n\nn=2: 5\n\nn=3:8\n\nn=4:11\n\nn=5:14\n\nSo, to find the step n for input 20, we can set up the equation:\n\n2 + 3*(n-1) = 20\n\nSolving for n:\n\n3*(n-1) = 20 - 2 = 18\n\nn-1 = 18/3 =6\n\nn=7\n\nSo, the 7th step.\n\nTherefore, the output for input 20 would be:\n\nOutput = Input + 3*(2*7 -1) = 20 + 3*13 = 20 + 39 = 59.\n\nLet me verify that.\n\nAlternatively, since the outputs are also increasing by 9 each time: 5,14,23,32,41,...\n\nWait, 14-5=9, 23-14=9, 32-23=9, 41-32=9. So, the outputs also form an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 9, starting at 5.\n\nSo, the nth output is 5 + 9*(n-1).\n\nSo, for n=1:5\n\nn=2:14\n\nn=3:23\n\nn=4:32\n\nn=5:41\n\nSo, to find the output for input 20, which is the 7th step, the output should be 5 + 9*(7-1)=5 + 54=59.\n\nYes, that matches.\n\nAlternatively, since the input is 20, which is 2 + 3*(n-1), n=7, and output is 5 + 9*(n-1)=5 +54=59.\n\nSo, the output is 59.\n\nTherefore, the rule is that each input is transformed by adding 3*(2n-1), where n is the step number, or equivalently, the output is the previous output plus 9 each time.\n\nSo, the answer is 59.\n</think>\n\nThe pattern involves adding an incrementing multiple of 3 to each input. For the 7th step, 20 + 39 = 59.\n\nDONE."

The differences indicate that each output is the sum of the input and a multiple of 3.\n\nTo find the exact multiple, I'll calculate the average difference:\n\n(3 + 9 + 15 + 21 + 27) / 5 = 75 / 5 = 15\n\nSince the average difference is 15, which is 5 multiplied by 3, the output can be expressed as:\n\nOutput = Input + 5 \u00d7 3 = Input + 15\n\nApplying this rule to the input value 20:\n\n20 + 15 = 35\n\nTherefore, the output for the input value 20 is 35.\n</think>\n\nLet's analyze the given sequence to identify the pattern and determine the rule that transforms the input into the output.\n\n**Given Sequence:**\n- **Input:** 2 \u2192 **Output:** 5\n- **Input:** 5 \u2192 **Output:** 14\n- **Input:** 8 \u2192 **Output:** 23\n- **Input:** 11 \u2192 **Output:** 32\n- **Input:** 14 \u2192 **Output:** 41\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Differences Between Inputs and Outputs**\n\nLet's compute the difference between each input and output:\n\n1. \\( 5 - 2 = 3 \\)\n2. \\( 14 - 5 = 9 \\)\n3. \\( 23 - 8 = 15 \\)\n4. \\( 32 - 11 = 21 \\)\n5. \\( 41 - 14 = 27 \\)\n\nSo, the differences are: **3, 9, 15, 21, 27**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Differences**\n\nNotice that each difference increases by **6**:\n\n- \\( 9 - 3 = 6 \\)\n- \\( 15 - 9 = 6 \\)\n- \\( 21 - 15 = 6 \\)\n- \\( 27 - 21 = 6 \\)\n\nThis indicates a consistent pattern where each output is the input plus a multiple of **3**.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Exact Rule**\n\nFrom the differences, we can observe that the output is the sum of the input and a multiple of **3**.

Then, calculate the output for the input value 20. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, we have this sequence of transformations:\n\n2 \u2192 5\n\n5 \u2192 14\n\n8 \u2192 23\n\n11 \u2192 32\n\n14 \u2192 41\n\nHmm, okay, so each input number is being transformed into another number. I need to find out what rule is converting the input to the output.\n\nFirst, maybe I'll look at the differences between the inputs and outputs to see if that helps. Let's list them out:\n\nInput: 2, Output: 5\n\nDifference: 5 - 2 = 3\n\nInput: 5, Output: 14\n\nDifference: 14 - 5 = 9\n\nInput: 8, Output: 23\n\nDifference: 23 - 8 = 15\n\nInput: 11, Output: 32\n\nDifference: 32 - 11 = 21\n\nInput: 14, Output: 41\n\nDifference: 41 - 14 = 27\n\nOkay, so the differences between the outputs and inputs are: 3, 9, 15, 21, 27.\n\nHmm, these differences look familiar. Let me see: 3, 9, 15, 21, 27.\n\nEach of these can be divided by 3:\n\n3 \u00f7 3 = 1\n\n9 \u00f7 3 = 3\n\n15 \u00f7 3 = 5\n\n21 \u00f7 3 = 7\n\n27 \u00f7 3 = 9\n\nSo, the differences themselves are increasing by 2 each time. 1, 3, 5, 7, 9.\n\nThat seems like a pattern. So, the difference between the output and input is an odd number that starts at 3 and increases by 2 each step.\n\nWait, let me check that. The first difference is 3, then 9, which is 3 + 6, but 6 isn't 2. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, no, 3, 9, 15, 21, 27. The difference between these is 6, 6, 6, 6. So, it's a constant difference of 6. But that contradicts what I thought earlier.\n\nWait, no, that's not right. The differences between the outputs and inputs are 3, 9, 15, 21, 27, which are themselves increasing by 6 each time. So, 3, then 3 + 6 = 9, 9 + 6 = 15, etc.\n\nSo, the difference between the output and input increases by 6 each time.\n\nBut how does that help me find the rule?\n\nMaybe the output is the input plus some function of the input. Let's see.\n\nLooking at the first one: 2 \u2192 5. So, 5 = 2 + 3.\n\nSecond: 5 + 9 = 14.\n\nThird: 8 + 15 = 23.\n\nFourth: 11 + 21 = 32.\n\nFifth: 14 + 27 = 41.\n\nSo, the added number is 3, 9, 15, 21, 27.\n\nWhich are multiples of 3: 3\u00d71, 3\u00d73, 3\u00d75, 3\u00d77, 3\u00d79.\n\nSo, the added number is 3 multiplied by the odd numbers starting from 1.\n\nSo, the added number is 3\u00d7(2n - 1), where n is the step. Wait, let's see.\n\nFor the first transformation, n=1: 3\u00d7(2\u00d71 -1)=3\u00d71=3.\n\nSecond, n=2: 3\u00d7(2\u00d72 -1)=3\u00d73=9.\n\nThird, n=3: 3\u00d7(2\u00d73 -1)=3\u00d75=15.\n\nYes, that seems to fit.\n\nSo, the output is the input plus 3\u00d7(2n -1), where n is the step number.\n\nBut how is n related to the input numbers?\n\nLooking at the input sequence: 2, 5, 8, 11, 14.\n\nEach input increases by 3: 2, then 5 (which is 2 +3), then 8 (5 +3), then 11 (8 +3), then 14 (11 +3).\n\nSo, the input is starting at 2 and adding 3 each time. So, it's an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 3.\n\nSo, the input can be represented as 2 + 3(k-1), where k is the step number.\n\nSo, for k=1: 2 + 3(0)=2.\n\nk=2: 2 + 3(1)=5.\n\nk=3: 2 + 3(2)=8.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, now, the output is input + 3\u00d7(2k -1).\n\nSo, for each step k, output = input + 3\u00d7(2k -1).\n\nSo, for example, for k=1: output=2 + 3\u00d7(2\u00d71 -1)=2 + 3\u00d71=5.\n\nSimilarly, for k=2: 5 + 3\u00d7(4-1)=5 +9=14.\n\nYes, that works.\n\nSo, the rule is: For each step k, starting at 2 and adding 3 each time, the output is the input plus 3 times (2k -1).\n\nSo, now, we need to find the output for input=20.\n\nFirst, we need to determine which step k corresponds to 20 in the input sequence.\n\nThe input sequence is 2,5,8,11,14,17,20,...\n\nSo, starting at 2, each term is previous +3.\n\nSo, 2,5,8,11,14,17,20,...\n\nSo, 20 is the 7th term (since 2 is the 1st, 5 the 2nd, 8 the 3rd, 11 the 4th, 14 the 5th, 17 the 6th, 20 the 7th).\n\nSo, k=7.\n\nThen, output = input + 3\u00d7(2\u00d77 -1)=20 +3\u00d713=20 +39=59.\n\nSo, the output should be 59.\n\nLet me verify with the previous steps.\n\nFor k=1: 2 +3\u00d71=5.\n\nk=2:5 +9=14.\n\nk=3:8 +15=23.\n\nk=4:11 +21=32.\n\nk=5:14 +27=41.\n\nk=6:17 +33=50.\n\nk=7:20 +39=59.\n\nYes, that fits.\n\nSo, the rule is that for each step k, starting from 2 and adding 3 each time, the output is the input plus 3\u00d7(2k-1).\n\nTherefore, for input=20, which is the 7th step, output=59.\n</think>\n\nThe pattern involves adding an incrementing multiple of 3 to each input. For the 7th step, the input is 20, and the output is calculated as 20 + 39 = 59.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Input Pattern:**\n   - The input sequence starts at 2 and increases by 3 each time.\n   - The sequence is: 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20, ...\n\n2. **Determine the Step Number (k):**\n   - The nth term of an arithmetic sequence can be found using the formula: a\u2099 = a\u2081 + (n-1)d\n   - Here, a\u2081 = 2, d = 3.\n   - For input = 20: 20 = 2 + (k-1)\u00d73 \u2192 18 = (k-1)\u00d73 \u2192 k-1=6 \u2192 k=7.\n\n3. **Calculate the Output:**\n   - The output increment is 3\u00d7(2k - 1).\n   - For k=7: 3\u00d7(14 -1)=3\u00d713=39.\n   - Output = 20 + 39 = 59.\n\n**Answer:** 59\n\nDONE."

Then, calculate the output for the input value 20. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I've got this sequence of transformations here, and I'm supposed to figure out the rule that turns the input into the output. Let's see what we have:\n\nInput \u2192 Output\n2 \u2192 5\n5 \u2192 14\n8 \u2192 23\n11 \u2192 32\n14 \u2192 41\n\nOkay, so the input numbers are 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, and the corresponding outputs are 5, 14, 23, 32, 41. Hmm, I need to find a pattern or a rule that connects each input to its output.\n\nFirst, maybe I should look at the differences between the inputs and outputs. Let's list them out:\n\n- For input 2: 2 \u2192 5. So, 2 becomes 5.\n- Input 5 \u2192 14. So, 5 becomes 14.\n- Input 8 \u2192 23. So, 8 becomes 23.\n- Input 11 \u2192 32. So, 11 becomes 32.\n- Input 14 \u2192 41. So, 14 becomes 41.\n\nLet me see if there's a mathematical relationship between the input and output. Maybe the output is a function of the input. Let's denote the input as 'n' and the output as 'f(n)'.\n\nSo, f(2) = 5\nf(5) = 14\nf(8) = 23\nf(11) = 32\nf(14) = 41\n\nI wonder if f(n) is a linear function, like f(n) = an + b. Let's test that.\n\nFor n=2: 2a + b = 5\nFor n=5: 5a + b = 14\nFor n=8: 8a + b = 23\nFor n=11: 11a + b = 32\nFor n=14: 14a + b = 41\n\nIf it's linear, then the differences between consecutive outputs should be consistent. Let's check the differences:\n\nFrom 5 to 14: 14 - 5 = 9\nFrom 14 to 23: 23 - 14 = 9\nFrom 23 to 32: 32 - 23 = 9\nFrom 32 to 41: 41 - 32 = 9\n\nOh, so the difference between each output is 9. That suggests that the function f(n) is linear with a common difference of 9.\n\nIf the function is linear, then the slope (a) would be the common difference divided by the common difference in n. But wait, what's the common difference in n?\n\nLooking at the inputs: 2, 5, 8, 11, 14. The difference between each input is 3. So, the inputs are increasing by 3 each time.\n\nSo, if the inputs are increasing by 3, and the outputs are increasing by 9, then the function f(n) must be adding 9 for every 3 added to n. That means the slope a is 9/3 = 3.\n\nSo, if f(n) = 3n + b.\n\nNow, let's find b using one of the equations.\n\nUsing n=2: 3(2) + b = 5 \u2192 6 + b = 5 \u2192 b = 5 - 6 = -1.\n\nSo, the function is f(n) = 3n - 1.\n\nLet me test this with the other numbers to make sure.\n\nFor n=5: 3(5) - 1 = 15 - 1 = 14. That's correct.\nFor n=8: 3(8) - 1 = 24 - 1 = 23. Correct.\nFor n=11: 3(11) - 1 = 33 - 1 = 32. Correct.\nFor n=14: 3(14) - 1 = 42 - 1 = 41. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the rule is f(n) = 3n - 1.\n\nNow, the problem asks for the output when the input is 20. So, f(20) = 3(20) - 1 = 60 - 1 = 59.\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n3 times 20 is 60, minus 1 is 59. Yep, that seems right.\n\nSo, the answer is 59.\n</think>\n\nThe rule transforming the input into the output is f(n) = 3n - 1. Applying this to the input value 20:\n\n20 * 3 - 1 = 60 - 1 = 59.\n\n**Answer:** 59\n\nDONE."
