  "question": "Let U be the universal set of all students in a university. Define the following sets:\nA = the set of students taking Mathematics\nB = the set of students taking Physics\nC = the set of students taking Chemistry\n\nExpress in set notation and then describe in words what the following set represents: (A \u2229 B) - C",
  "answer": "The set (A \u2229 B) - C can be written as:\n\n(A \u2229 B) - C = (A \u2229 B) \u2229 C^c\n\nWhere C^c represents the complement of set C.\n\nStep 1: First, find A \u2229 B\nA \u2229 B = {students taking both Mathematics and Physics}\n\nStep 2: Then, subtract set C from this intersection\n(A \u2229 B) - C = {students in A \u2229 B who are not in C}\n\nTherefore, (A \u2229 B) - C represents the set of students who are taking both Mathematics and Physics but are not taking Chemistry.\n\nIn words: \"The set of all students who are enrolled in both Mathematics and Physics courses but are not enrolled in Chemistry.\""
