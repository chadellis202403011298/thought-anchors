Let me start by recalling what each of these symbols represents.\n\nFirst, U is the universal set, which means it includes all possible students in the university. So, U is like the biggest possible set containing everyone.\n\nNow, A is the set of students taking Mathematics. That's straightforward. So, A consists of all students who are enrolled in Math classes.\n\nSimilarly, B is the set of students taking Physics. So, B has all the students who are in Physics classes.\n\nC is the set of students taking Chemistry. Got it. So, C includes everyone in Chemistry.\n\nThe problem is asking for the set (A \u2229 B) - C. Hmm, let me break this down. \n\nI remember that the intersection of two sets, A \u2229 B, means all the students who are in both A and B. So, these are students who are taking both Mathematics and Physics.\n\nNow, we have to subtract set C from this intersection. That means we need to take all the students in A \u2229 B and remove those who are also in C.\n\nSo, in set notation, (A \u2229 B) - C would include all students who are in both Mathematics and Physics but not in Chemistry.\n\nLet me visualize this. Imagine a Venn diagram where A, B, and C are overlapping circles. The intersection of A and B is the overlapping area between Math and Physics. From this overlapping area, we're excluding the part that also overlaps with Chemistry. So, the resulting set would be the area that's common to both Math and Physics but not in Chemistry.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the set (A \u2229 B) - C consists of students who are taking both Mathematics and Physics but are not taking Chemistry.\n\nJust to make sure I'm not making a mistake, let me go through it again. A \u2229 B is Math and Physics students. Subtracting C means removing Chemistry students from that group. So, the final set should be Math and Physics students who are not in Chemistry.\n\nYes, that seems right. I don't think I'm missing anything here. It's like filtering the intersection of Math and Physics to exclude those who are also in Chemistry.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the set (A \u2229 B) - C is the set of students who are taking both Mathematics and Physics but not taking Chemistry.\n</think>\n\nTo solve (A \u2229 B) - C, we first find the intersection of sets A and B, which includes students taking both Mathematics and Physics. Then, we subtract set C, removing those students who are also taking Chemistry.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Find A \u2229 B:** This set contains students enrolled in both Mathematics and Physics.\n2. **Subtract C from A \u2229 B:** Remove all students who are also in Chemistry, leaving only those in Mathematics and Physics but not in Chemistry.\n\n**Set Notation:**\n\\[\n(A \\cap B) - C = \\{ x \\in U \\mid x \\in A \\cap B \\text{ and } x \\notin C \\}\n\\]\n\n**Description:**\nThis set includes all students who are taking both Mathematics and Physics but are not taking Chemistry.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe set \\((A \\cap B) - C\\) consists of students taking both Mathematics and Physics but not Chemistry.\n\nDONE."

Let me try to wrap my head around it step by step. \n\nFirst, the problem defines the universal set U as all the students in the university. That makes sense\u2014U is like the big set containing everyone. Then, there are three specific sets: A, B, and C. \n\nSet A is the students taking Mathematics. Okay, so A is a subset of U where every student in A is enrolled in Math. Similarly, set B is for students taking Physics, so B is another subset of U with Physics students. Set C is for Chemistry students, so C is a subset of U with Chem students. Got it.\n\nNow, the question is asking me to express the set (A \u2229 B) - C in set notation and then describe what it represents. Hmm, let's break that down. \n\nFirst, what is A \u2229 B? Intersection means the students who are in both A and B. So, that's students who are taking both Mathematics and Physics. Got that. So, A \u2229 B is the set of students taking both subjects.\n\nNow, the problem is asking for (A \u2229 B) - C. The minus sign here is set difference. So, this would be all the students who are in A \u2229 B but not in C. In other words, students taking both Math and Physics who are not taking Chemistry.\n\nLet me think about how to write this in set notation. The intersection is straightforward, but the set difference might trip me up. So, (A \u2229 B) - C would be all elements that are in A \u2229 B but not in C. So, in symbols, that would be (A \u2229 B) minus C, which in set notation is written as (A \u2229 B) \\ C, using the backslash for set difference.\n\nOkay, so now I need to describe what this set represents in words. It's the set of students who are taking both Mathematics and Physics but are not taking Chemistry. So, they are in both A and B but not in C.\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The universal set is all students, so when I take the intersection of A and B, I'm only considering those students who are in both sets. Then, subtracting C means I exclude any students who are in C. So, the final set is a subset of both A and B, but not in C.\n\nIs there another way to think about this? Maybe visualize it with a Venn diagram. U is the big circle. A, B, and C are overlapping circles inside U. A \u2229 B would be the overlapping area between A and B, which is also not in C. So, if I take that overlapping area and remove the part that overlaps with C, I'm left with students taking both Math and Physics but not Chemistry.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, in set notation, (A \u2229 B) - C is the correct way to express it, and in words, it's students taking both Mathematics and Physics but not Chemistry.\n</think>\n\nThe set (A \u2229 B) - C is expressed in set notation as (A \u2229 B) \\ C. This represents the set of students who are enrolled in both Mathematics and Physics but are not enrolled in Chemistry.\n\nDONE."

Let me read it again carefully.\n\nWe have the universal set U, which is all students in a university. Then, there are three sets defined:\n\n- A is the set of students taking Mathematics.\n- B is the set of students taking Physics.\n- C is the set of students taking Chemistry.\n\nAnd the question is asking me to express the set (A \u2229 B) - C in set notation and then describe what this set represents in words.\n\nOkay, let me break this down. First, I need to remember what each of these set operations means.\n\nI know that the intersection of two sets, A \u2229 B, consists of all elements that are in both A and B. So, that would be students who are taking both Mathematics and Physics.\n\nThen, the minus sign in set operations usually denotes the difference between sets. So, (A \u2229 B) - C would mean all elements that are in the intersection of A and B but not in C. In other words, students who are taking both Mathematics and Physics but not taking Chemistry.\n\nLet me make sure I'm not mixing up anything. Sometimes, the minus sign can be confused with symmetric difference or other operations, but in this context, it's standard set difference. So, it's not A \u2229 B minus all of C, but specifically the part of A \u2229 B that's not in C.\n\nSo, to write this in set notation, I think it would be:\n\n(A \u2229 B) - C = {x | x \u2208 A \u2229 B and x \u2209 C}\n\nAlternatively, using curly braces for clarity, it's the set of all elements x such that x is in both A and B and x is not in C.\n\nLet me think if there's another way to write this. Sometimes, set difference can be expressed using a horizontal line through the element, but in notation, it's usually with the minus sign.\n\nSo, I think (A \u2229 B) - C is correct.\n\nNow, to describe this set in words: It's the set of students who are taking both Mathematics and Physics but not taking Chemistry. So, they are in both A and B, but they are excluded from C.\n\nI don't see any mistakes in this reasoning. It's straightforward once you break down each operation step by step. Intersection first, then the difference with set C.\n\nSo, the final set notation is (A \u2229 B) - C, and the description is students taking both Mathematics and Physics but not Chemistry.\n</think>\n\nThe set (A \u2229 B) - C can be expressed in set notation as (A \u2229 B) - C. In words, this represents the set of students who are taking both Mathematics and Physics but not taking Chemistry.\n\nDONE."

So it should be (A \u2229 B) - C.\n\nTo double-check, if I have a Venn diagram, A and B overlapping, and C being another circle. The intersection A \u2229 B is the overlapping part of A and B. Then subtracting C would mean excluding the part where this overlapping region also overlaps with C.
