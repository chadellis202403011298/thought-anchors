  "question": "A small town has a strict rule: every person's house must be painted either white, blue, or green. One day, a new resident arrives and paints her house red. Surprisingly, no one in the town objects or asks her to repaint it. Why not?",
  "answer": "The solution requires reframing our understanding of the situation:\n\n1. First, we need to question our assumptions about the rule itself. We automatically assume that the rule prohibits red houses.\n\n2. However, the key insight is to realize that the rule only states that houses must be painted white, blue, or green. It doesn't explicitly forbid other colors.\n\n3. The new resident didn't paint a house that was supposed to be white, blue, or green. She painted something else: a house that wasn't covered by the rule.\n\n4. The most logical explanation is that the rule applies only to certain types of houses (perhaps family homes), while the new resident's building is of a different type (perhaps a business with living quarters, a historical building with special status, or temporary housing).\n\n5. By reframing our understanding of what constitutes a 'house' under the town's regulations, we can see that there is no contradiction or rule violation.\n\nThis is a classic example of creative reframing in lateral thinking, where the solution comes from challenging our initial interpretation of the problem statement rather than working within its apparent constraints."
