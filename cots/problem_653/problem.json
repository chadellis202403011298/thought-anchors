  "question": "A small marketing team is brainstorming ideas for a new eco-friendly product launch using a mind map. They start with 'Eco-Product Launch' as the central node and create five main branches: 'Target Audience', 'Marketing Channels', 'Product Features', 'Budget', and 'Timeline'. Each team member is responsible for one branch and must create exactly three sub-branches with specific ideas. However, they realize that effective mind mapping requires connections between related ideas across different branches. If each sub-branch needs to connect to at least one sub-branch from a different main branch, what is the minimum total number of cross-connections needed across the entire mind map?",
  "answer": "To solve this problem, I need to analyze the structure of the mind map and determine the minimum number of cross-connections needed.\n\nGiven information:\n- Central node: 'Eco-Product Launch'\n- 5 main branches: 'Target Audience', 'Marketing Channels', 'Product Features', 'Budget', and 'Timeline'\n- Each main branch has 3 sub-branches\n- Each sub-branch must connect to at least one sub-branch from a different main branch\n\nStep 1: Calculate the total number of sub-branches.\n5 main branches \u00d7 3 sub-branches per main branch = 15 total sub-branches\n\nStep 2: Determine what constitutes the minimum number of connections.\nFor the minimum case, each sub-branch will connect to exactly one sub-branch from a different main branch. However, if sub-branch A connects to sub-branch B, this counts as a single connection, not two separate connections.\n\nStep 3: Create an efficient connection strategy.\nTo minimize the number of connections, we can arrange the sub-branches in 5 groups of 3 (matching our 5 main branches). If we visualize these groups in a circular arrangement, we can connect each sub-branch to one in the adjacent group.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the minimum connections needed.\nWith this efficient arrangement, we would need 15 connections (one for each sub-branch). However, since each connection links two sub-branches, we would be double-counting. Therefore, the minimum number of unique connections is 15 \u00f7 2 = 7.5, which rounds up to 8 connections.\n\nActually, we need to be more precise. With 15 sub-branches, if each makes exactly one connection, we get 15 total connection endpoints. Since each actual connection has 2 endpoints, we need 15 \u00f7 2 = 7.5 connections. Since we can't have a partial connection, we need at least 8 connections.\n\nTherefore, the minimum total number of cross-connections needed is 8."
