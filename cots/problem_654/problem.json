  "question": "A small town implemented a new traffic light at a busy intersection in January. After six months, the town's safety committee reported that accidents at that intersection decreased by 30% compared to the previous year. The mayor declares the traffic light a success and claims it caused the reduction in accidents. However, a skeptical council member points out that the town also reduced the speed limit on the approaching roads in March and launched a public safety campaign about intersection safety in April. Based on this information, what is the flaw in the mayor's causal reasoning, and what would be a more appropriate conclusion about the traffic light's effect?",
  "answer": "The mayor's causal reasoning contains the classic flaw of ignoring potential confounding variables. The mayor attributes the 30% reduction in accidents solely to the installation of the traffic light, establishing a direct causal link between these two events.\n\nHowever, there are at least two other interventions that could have influenced the accident rate:\n1. The reduced speed limit implemented in March\n2. The public safety campaign launched in April\n\nThese are confounding variables that could partially or entirely explain the observed reduction in accidents. Without controlling for these variables, it's impossible to determine how much of the 30% reduction can be attributed to the traffic light alone.\n\nA more appropriate conclusion would be: \"While accident rates have decreased by 30% since several safety measures were implemented, including the new traffic light, the reduced speed limit, and the safety campaign, we cannot determine the specific contribution of the traffic light alone. Further analysis that controls for these other factors would be needed to establish the causal effect of the traffic light on accident reduction.\"\n\nTo properly establish causation, the town could conduct a more rigorous analysis such as:\n- Comparing with similar intersections that did not receive any interventions\n- Analyzing accident trends before and after each specific intervention\n- Collecting data on driver behavior at the intersection\n- Using statistical methods like regression analysis to control for the timing of the different interventions"
