  "question": "A cube has each face painted with a different color: red, blue, green, yellow, orange, and purple. The cube is photographed from a particular angle, showing exactly three faces: the red face is on the left, the blue face is on the right, and the yellow face is on top. If the cube is rotated 90 degrees clockwise around the vertical axis (the axis passing through the centers of the top and bottom faces), which three colors will be visible, and in what positions (left, right, top)?",
  "answer": "To solve this problem, I need to track the position of each colored face as the cube rotates.\n\nInitial state:\n- Left face: Red\n- Right face: Blue\n- Top face: Yellow\n- (The bottom face is opposite to the top face, so it must be the color opposite to yellow.)\n- (The front and back faces aren't visible, but they must be the remaining two colors.)\n\nWhen the cube rotates 90 degrees clockwise around the vertical axis:\n\n1. The top face (Yellow) remains at the top since we're rotating around the vertical axis.\n2. The left face (Red) moves to become the back face (no longer visible).\n3. The right face (Blue) moves to become the front face.\n4. The face that was originally at the back (not visible initially) now becomes the right face.\n5. The face that was originally at the front (not visible initially) now becomes the left face.\n\nSince we don't explicitly know which colors are on the front, back, and bottom faces initially, we need to determine them through elimination:\n\nThe colors we have are: red, blue, green, yellow, orange, and purple.\nWe know yellow is on top, red is on the left, and blue is on the right initially.\n\nThis leaves green, orange, and purple for the front, back, and bottom faces.\n\nAfter the rotation:\n- The top face remains Yellow.\n- The front face becomes Blue (previously the right face).\n- The left face becomes whatever was on the front initially (either green, orange, or purple).\n- The right face becomes whatever was on the back initially (either green, orange, or purple).\n\nWithout additional information, we can't determine exactly which of green, orange, or purple will be on the left and right. However, we can definitively say:\n\nAfter the 90-degree clockwise rotation around the vertical axis, the visible faces will be:\n- Left: Either green, orange, or purple (whichever was initially on the front)\n- Right: Either green, orange, or purple (whichever was initially on the back)\n- Top: Yellow (unchanged)\n\nBased on the original question, the answer is that Yellow remains on top, Blue moves to the front (no longer on the right), and the left face becomes one of the initially hidden colors (green, orange, or purple) that was on the front face before rotation."
