  "question": "A team of designers is working on a new water bottle for hikers and has three prototype options: A, B, and C. They conduct user testing with 30 hikers who try all three prototypes and provide feedback. The results show that 15 hikers prefer prototype A, 10 prefer prototype B, and 5 prefer prototype C. However, when asked about specific features, the team discovers that 25 hikers love the cap design of prototype C, 20 prefer the grip texture of prototype B, and 18 like the insulation technology of prototype A. Given this feedback, what would be the most effective next step in the prototyping process to create a successful final product?",
  "answer": "The most effective next step would be to create a hybrid prototype that combines the most popular features from each original prototype.\n\nAnalyzing the data:\n1. While prototype A received the most overall preferences (15 hikers), the cap design of prototype C was actually the most popular individual feature (25 hikers).  \n2. The grip texture of prototype B was the second most popular feature (20 hikers).  \n3. The insulation technology of prototype A was appreciated by 18 hikers.\n\nThis indicates a disconnect between overall preference and feature preference. Users might be selecting their overall favorite based on one standout feature while compromising on others.\n\nThe logical next step is to create a new iteration (prototype D) that combines:\n- The cap design from prototype C (preferred by 25/30 hikers)\n- The grip texture from prototype B (preferred by 20/30 hikers)\n- The insulation technology from prototype A (preferred by 18/30 hikers)\n\nThis approach embodies the essence of iterative prototyping: gathering user feedback, identifying the most successful elements, and incorporating them into improved versions. By combining the strongest features from each prototype, the team can create a product that better meets user needs than any of the original prototypes individually."
