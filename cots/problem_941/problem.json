  "question": "A small tech company has 20 employees in its engineering department. 12 of these engineers know Python, 15 know JavaScript, and 10 know both Python and JavaScript. If you randomly select one engineer from this department, what is the probability that they know JavaScript given that they know Python?",
  "answer": "To solve this problem, we need to find the conditional probability P(JavaScript | Python), which is the probability that a randomly selected engineer knows JavaScript given that they know Python.\n\nThe conditional probability formula is: P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B)\n\nIn our case:\n- P(Python) = probability of knowing Python = 12/20 = 0.6\n- P(JavaScript and Python) = probability of knowing both = 10/20 = 0.5\n\nUsing the conditional probability formula:\nP(JavaScript | Python) = P(JavaScript and Python) / P(Python)\nP(JavaScript | Python) = 0.5 / 0.6 = 5/6 \u2248 0.833 or about 83.3%\n\nAlternatively, we can think about this more directly: Among the 12 engineers who know Python, 10 of them also know JavaScript. So the probability is 10/12 = 5/6 \u2248 0.833 or about 83.3%.\n\nTherefore, the probability that a randomly selected engineer knows JavaScript given that they know Python is 5/6 or approximately 83.3%."
