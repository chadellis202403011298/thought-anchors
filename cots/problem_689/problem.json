  "question": "Consider a 2D shape that looks like the letter 'F'. If this shape is rotated 90 degrees clockwise, then 180 degrees counterclockwise, what would it look like compared to its original position? Use the following orientation for the original 'F': the vertical line is on the left, with two horizontal lines extending to the right - one at the top and one in the middle.",
  "answer": "To solve this problem, we need to track the orientation of the 'F' shape through each rotation:\n\nStep 1: Start with the original 'F' shape. The vertical line is on the left, with horizontal lines extending to the right at the top and middle.\n\nStep 2: Rotate 90 degrees clockwise. After this rotation, the vertical line will be at the top, with the horizontal lines extending downward - one on the left and one in the middle.\n\nStep 3: Rotate 180 degrees counterclockwise (which is equivalent to rotating 180 degrees in either direction). This flips the shape upside down from its position in Step 2.\n\nAfter this 180-degree rotation, the vertical line will now be at the bottom, with the horizontal lines extending upward - one on the right and one in the middle.\n\nComparing this final position to the original, we can see that the 'F' shape has effectively been rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise from its original position. The vertical line that was originally on the left is now at the bottom, and the horizontal lines that extended to the right now extend upward."
