  "question": "A small community library has been experiencing declining visitor numbers. The library has a limited budget of $500 to address this issue. Using divergent thinking, list at least 5 substantially different approaches the library could take to increase visitor numbers with this budget. Then, evaluate which approach would likely be most effective and explain your reasoning.",
  "answer": "Using divergent thinking to generate multiple solutions:\n\n1. Community Events Approach: Use the $500 to host a series of small community events like book clubs, children's story time, or local author readings. This creates regular activities that draw people in repeatedly.\n\n2. Space Redesign Approach: Use the budget to purchase comfortable seating, plants, and coffee station supplies to transform a section of the library into a cozy reading/working space that feels like a caf\u00e9 without the expense.\n\n3. Digital Presence Approach: Invest the budget in developing an engaging social media presence, creating a user-friendly website with digital resources, and implementing an email newsletter highlighting new books and events.\n\n4. Partnership Approach: Use the budget for networking events or partnership materials to develop collaborations with local schools, community centers, and businesses who could direct people to the library or co-sponsor programs.\n\n5. Specialized Collection Approach: Invest the $500 in a unique, specialized collection not available elsewhere locally (e.g., board games, craft supplies for checkout, or tools) to attract new audience segments.\n\nEvaluation of Most Effective Approach:\nThe Community Events Approach would likely be most effective because:\n\n1. It provides ongoing reasons for people to visit rather than a one-time improvement\n2. It builds community connections and word-of-mouth marketing\n3. Each event creates an opportunity for publicity\n4. Regular attendees are likely to also become regular book borrowers\n5. The approach is sustainable - once materials for events are purchased, many events can be run with volunteer support\n6. The approach directly addresses the human connection element that online resources cannot replace\n\nThis solution best addresses the core need of libraries in the digital age: providing compelling reasons for physical visits beyond just borrowing books."
