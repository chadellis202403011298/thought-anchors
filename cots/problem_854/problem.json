  "question": "A woman needs to transport a fox, a chicken, and a bag of grain across a river. She has a small boat that can only carry her and one other item at a time. If left unattended together, the fox will eat the chicken, and the chicken will eat the grain. How can she transport all three items safely to the other side of the river?",
  "answer": "This problem requires thinking beyond the obvious sequential crossings.\n\nStep 1: The woman takes the chicken across the river first (leaving the fox and grain behind).\n\nStep 2: She returns to the starting side alone.\n\nStep 3: She takes the fox across the river (now the fox and chicken are on the far side).\n\nStep 4: She brings the chicken back with her to the starting side (to prevent the fox from eating it).\n\nStep 5: She takes the grain across the river (leaving the chicken behind, but now the fox and grain are on the far side).\n\nStep 6: She returns alone to the starting side.\n\nStep 7: Finally, she takes the chicken across the river again.\n\nNow all three items (fox, chicken, and grain) are safely on the far side of the river. The key insight is recognizing that items can be brought back from the far side, which creates more possibilities than simply taking each item across once."
