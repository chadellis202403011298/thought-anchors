Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's make sure I understand the problem correctly. We have a universe of discourse which consists of the positive integers {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. Okay, so we're dealing with numbers from 1 to 5. Good.\n\nNow, there are two predicates defined here: P(x) is 'x is even', and Q(x) is 'x is prime'. So, P(x) is true for even numbers, and Q(x) is true for prime numbers. Got it.\n\nThe statements I need to evaluate are:\n\na) \u2203x(P(x) \u2227 Q(x))\nb) \u2200x(P(x) \u2192 \u00acQ(x))\nc) \u2200x(Q(x) \u2192 \u00acP(x))\nd) \u2203x(\u00acP(x) \u2227 \u00acQ(x))\n\nAlright, let's take them one by one.\n\nStarting with statement a: \u2203x(P(x) \u2227 Q(x)). So, this is an existential quantifier saying there exists an x in our universe such that both P(x) and Q(x) are true. In other words, there's a number in {1,2,3,4,5} that is both even and prime.\n\nHmm, let's think about the numbers from 1 to 5. The even numbers in this set are 2, 4. Now, which of these are prime? Well, 2 is prime, right? 2 is the only even prime number. 4 is even but not prime because it can be divided by 2. So, 2 is both even and prime. Therefore, there exists such an x, which is 2. So, statement a) is true.\n\nMoving on to statement b: \u2200x(P(x) \u2192 \u00acQ(x)). This is a universal quantifier saying that for all x in the universe, if x is even, then x is not prime. In logical terms, this is saying that no even number is prime. But wait, I remember that 2 is both even and prime. So, if we take x=2, P(2) is true because 2 is even, and Q(2) is also true because 2 is prime. So, P(2) \u2192 \u00acQ(2) would be false because the implication is only false when the antecedent is true and the consequent is false. Here, both are true, making the implication true? Wait, no, wait. Let me recall: In logic, P \u2192 Q is only false when P is true and Q is false. So, if P is true and Q is true, P \u2192 Q is true. So, in this case, for x=2, P(x) is true, Q(x) is true, so P(x) \u2192 \u00acQ(x) would be true? Wait, no. Wait, P(x) \u2192 \u00acQ(x) is the same as saying \"if P(x), then not Q(x)\". So, for x=2, since P(2) is true and Q(2) is true, the implication would be \"if it's even, then it's not prime\". But 2 is even and prime, so the implication is false because the conclusion doesn't hold. Therefore, since there exists an x (specifically x=2) where P(x) is true and Q(x) is also true, the implication P(x) \u2192 \u00acQ(x) is false for that x. Therefore, the universal statement \u2200x(P(x) \u2192 \u00acQ(x)) is false because it's not true for all x. So, statement b) is false.\n\nNow, statement c: \u2200x(Q(x) \u2192 \u00acP(x)). This is a universal statement saying that for all x, if x is prime, then x is not even. So, in other words, no prime number is even. But wait, again, 2 is a prime number and it's even. So, let's test this. For x=2, Q(2) is true because 2 is prime, and P(2) is also true because 2 is even. So, Q(2) \u2192 \u00acP(2) would be \"if prime, then not even\". But since 2 is both prime and even, the implication is false because the conclusion doesn't hold. Therefore, since there's at least one x (x=2) where Q(x) is true and P(x) is also true, the universal statement \u2200x(Q(x) \u2192 \u00acP(x)) is false. So, statement c) is false.\n\nFinally, statement d: \u2203x(\u00acP(x) \u2227 \u00acQ(x)). This is an existential quantifier saying there exists an x in the universe such that x is neither even nor prime. So, we need to find a number in {1,2,3,4,5} that is not even and not prime.\n\nLet's list the numbers:\n\n1: Is 1 even? No. Is 1 prime? No, because prime numbers have exactly two distinct positive divisors, and 1 only has one. So, 1 is neither even nor prime.\n\nSo, x=1 satisfies \u00acP(x) \u2227 \u00acQ(x). Therefore, there exists such an x, making statement d) true.\n\nWait, let me double-check. The numbers from 1 to 5 are 1,2,3,4,5.\n\n- 1: Not even, not prime.\n- 2: Even, prime.\n- 3: Odd, prime.\n- 4: Even, not prime.\n- 5: Odd, prime.\n\nSo, only 1 is neither even nor prime. Therefore, yes, \u2203x(\u00acP(x) \u2227 \u00acQ(x)) is true because x=1 works.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\na) True\n\nb) False\n\nc) False\n\nd) True\n\nI think that's it. Let me just make sure I didn't mix up any of the implications.\n\nFor statement b), \u2200x(P(x) \u2192 \u00acQ(x)), we have x=2 making it false, so the statement is false.\n\nFor statement c), \u2200x(Q(x) \u2192 \u00acP(x)), x=2 makes it false, so the statement is false.\n\nStatements a) and d) are true because we have x=2 and x=1 respectively satisfying the conditions.\n</think>\n\na) True\n\nb) False\n\nc) False\n\nd) True\n\nDONE."

Let me break it down step by step because I'm still getting the hang of this.\n\nFirst, let me understand the universe of discourse. It's the set of positive integers {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. Okay, so we're dealing with numbers 1 through 5. Got it.\n\nNow, the predicates:\n\n- P(x) is 'x is even'. So, P(x) is true if x is an even number in this set.\n- Q(x) is 'x is prime'. So, Q(x) is true if x is a prime number in this set.\n\nLet me list out which numbers are even and which are prime in this universe.\n\nEven numbers: 2, 4. So, P(x) is true for x=2 and x=4.\nPrime numbers: 2, 3, 5. So, Q(x) is true for x=2, 3, 5.\n\nAlright, now let's look at each statement one by one.\n\na) \u2203x(P(x) \u2227 Q(x))\n\nThis is an existence statement. It's saying there exists an x in our universe such that both P(x) and Q(x) are true. In other words, is there a number that is both even and prime?\n\nFrom what I recall, 2 is the only even prime number. So, x=2 should satisfy both P(x) and Q(x). Let me verify:\n\n- P(2) = true (since 2 is even)\n- Q(2) = true (since 2 is prime)\n\nSo, P(2) \u2227 Q(2) is true. Therefore, \u2203x(P(x) \u2227 Q(x)) is true.\n\nb) \u2200x(P(x) \u2192 \u00acQ(x))\n\nThis is a universal statement. It says that for all x in our universe, if x is even, then x is not prime. In logical terms, this is saying that no even number is prime. Wait a minute, isn't 2 both even and prime? So, if x=2, then P(2) is true, but Q(2) is also true. That means P(2) \u2192 \u00acQ(2) is false because the antecedent is true, and the consequent is false.\n\nSince the statement is \u2200x, if there's at least one x that makes the implication false, then the entire statement is false. So, because 2 is even and prime, this statement is false.\n\nc) \u2200x(Q(x) \u2192 \u00acP(x))\n\nThis is another universal statement. It claims that for all x, if x is prime, then x is not even. In other words, no prime number is even. Wait, but 2 is prime and even. So, when x=2, Q(2) is true, but P(2) is also true. Therefore, Q(2) \u2192 \u00acP(2) is false because the antecedent is true, and the consequent is false.\n\nSince there's at least one x (specifically x=2) that makes this implication false, the entire statement \u2200x(Q(x) \u2192 \u00acP(x)) is false.\n\nd) \u2203x(\u00acP(x) \u2227 \u00acQ(x))\n\nThis is an existence statement. It says there exists an x in our universe such that x is neither even nor prime. So, we need to find a number between 1 and 5 that is neither even nor prime.\n\nLet's list out the numbers and see:\n\n- 1: Is 1 even? No. Is 1 prime? No. So, \u00acP(1) is true, \u00acQ(1) is true. Therefore, \u00acP(1) \u2227 \u00acQ(1) is true.\n- 2: Already discussed, it's even and prime.\n- 3: Prime, not even.\n- 4: Even, not prime.\n- 5: Prime, not even.\n\nSo, x=1 fits the bill here because it's neither even nor prime. Therefore, \u2203x(\u00acP(x) \u2227 \u00acQ(x)) is true.\n\nWait, just to double-check, is 1 considered neither even nor prime? Yes, 1 is a unit, not a prime, and it's not even. So, yes, 1 is the number that makes this statement true.\n\nOkay, so to recap:\n\na) True because 2 is both even and prime.\n\nb) False because 2 is even and prime, making the implication false.\n\nc) False because 2 is prime and even, making the implication false.\n\nd) True because 1 is neither even nor prime.\n\nI think that's all. Let me make sure I didn't miss anything. For statement b, I thought about whether any even number is prime, and since 2 is, the statement fails. For statement c, same thing but the other way around, and since 2 is prime and even, it fails. For statement a, 2 is the only even prime, so it works. For statement d, 1 is the only number that doesn't fit into either category, so it works.\n\nYeah, I think that's solid.\nDONE.\n</think>\n\nAlright, let's go through each statement one by one based on the analysis.\n\na) **\u2203x(P(x) \u2227 Q(x))**  \n- **True**: 2 is both even and prime.\n\nb) **\u2200x(P(x) \u2192 \u00acQ(x))**  \n- **False**: 2 is even and prime, making the implication false.\n\nc) **\u2200x(Q(x) \u2192 \u00acP(x))**  \n- **False**: 2 is prime and even, making the implication false.\n\nd) **\u2203x(\u00acP(x) \u2227 \u00acQ(x))**  \n- **True**: 1 is neither even nor prime.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\na) True  \nb) False  \nc) False  \nd) True  \n\nDONE."

The universe of discourse is the set of positive integers {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. The predicates P(x) and Q(x) are defined as follows: P(x) means \"x is even,\" and Q(x) means \"x is prime.\" Let me take each part step by step.\n\nStarting with part a: \u2203x(P(x) \u2227 Q(x)). This is an existential quantifier, meaning there exists some x in the universe such that both P(x) and Q(x) are true. So, I need to find if there's a number in {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} that is both even and prime.\n\nFirst, let's list the even numbers in the set. The numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. The even ones are 2 and 4. Now, which of these are prime? 2 is a prime number because its only divisors are 1 and itself. 4, on the other hand, is not prime because it can be divided by 1, 2, and 4. So, 2 is both even and prime. Therefore, there exists such an x, which is 2. So, part a should be true.\n\nMoving on to part b: \u2200x(P(x) \u2192 \u00acQ(x)). This is a universal quantifier, meaning for all x in the set, if x is even, then x is not prime. So, I need to check if every even number in the set is not prime.\n\nLooking back at the even numbers: 2 and 4. We already know 2 is prime, so P(2) is true, but Q(2) is also true, which would make the implication P(x) \u2192 \u00acQ(x) false for x=2. Since the implication is false for x=2, the entire statement \u2200x(P(x) \u2192 \u00acQ(x)) is false. Therefore, part b is false.\n\nNow, part c: \u2200x(Q(x) \u2192 \u00acP(x)). This translates to for all x, if x is prime, then x is not even. So, I need to check if every prime number in the set is odd.\n\nThe prime numbers in {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} are 2, 3, and 5. Let's evaluate each:\n\n- For x=2: Q(2) is true (prime), and P(2) is true (even). So, Q(2) \u2192 \u00acP(2) would be true \u2192 false, which is false. Therefore, the implication is false for x=2, making the entire statement false. So, part c is false.\n\nLastly, part d: \u2203x(\u00acP(x) \u2227 \u00acQ(x)). This is an existential quantifier, meaning there exists an x such that x is neither even nor prime. So, I need to find a number in the set that is not even and not prime.\n\nLooking at the numbers: 1 is neither even nor prime. 3 is prime, so it's out. 5 is prime as well. 2 and 4 are even. So, the number 1 fits the criteria. Therefore, such an x exists (x=1), making part d true.\n\nTo recap:\n\na) True because 2 is even and prime.\n\nb) False because 2 is even and prime, making the implication false.\n\nc) False because 2 is prime and even, making the implication false.\n\nd) True because 1 is neither even nor prime.\n\nI think that's all. I should double-check to make sure I didn't miss any numbers or misapply the logic.\n\nDouble-checking part a: 2 is prime and even. Yes.\n\nPart b: The implication fails for 2, so the statement is false.\n\nPart c: Similarly, the implication fails for 2, so it's false.\n\nPart d: 1 is neither, so it's true.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\nDONE.\n</think>\n\na) True  \nb) False  \nc) False  \nd) True  \n\nDONE."

Let me see if I can figure this out step by step. The universe of discourse is the positive integers from 1 to 5, so that's {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. Cool, that's manageable. \n\nFirst, let's break down what each predicate means. P(x) is \"x is even,\" and Q(x) is \"x is prime.\" So, we're dealing with even numbers and prime numbers within this set. \n\nNow, the question asks me to evaluate four different statements: a, b, c, and d. Each of these is a logical statement involving P(x) and Q(x). I need to determine whether each is true or false.\n\nStarting with part a: \u2203x(P(x) \u2227 Q(x)). This reads as \"There exists an x such that x is even and x is prime.\" In other words, is there a number between 1 and 5 that is both even and prime?\n\nLet me list out the numbers and see. \n\n1: Hmm, 1 is neither prime nor composite. So, it's not even, so P(x) is false here.\n2: 2 is even, right? So P(2) is true. And 2 is also a prime number. So Q(2) is true. Therefore, P(2) \u2227 Q(2) is true. So, there exists such an x, specifically x=2. That makes part a) true.\n\nMoving on to part b: \u2200x(P(x) \u2192 \u00acQ(x)). This translates to \"For all x, if x is even, then x is not prime.\" So, does every even number in 1-5 not being prime?\n\nLet's check each even number. \n\n2: Even, and prime. So, P(2) is true, but Q(2) is also true. Therefore, P(2) \u2192 \u00acQ(2) would be false because the implication would be \"If true, then false,\" which is not the case. So, the statement is false because there's at least one x (which is 2) where P(x) is true, but Q(x) is also true, making the implication false. Hence, part b) is false.\n\nNext is part c: \u2200x(Q(x) \u2192 \u00acP(x)). This means \"For all x, if x is prime, then x is not even.\" So, does every prime number in 1-5 not being even?\n\nLooking at primes in the set: 2, 3, 5.\n\n2: Prime, but also even. So, Q(2) is true, but P(2) is also true. Therefore, Q(2) \u2192 \u00acP(2) would be \"If true, then false,\" which is false. Hence, the statement is false because 2 is a prime that's even, making the implication false. So, part c) is false.\n\nLastly, part d: \u2203x(\u00acP(x) \u2227 \u00acQ(x)). This is \"There exists an x such that x is not even and x is not prime.\" So, is there a number in 1-5 that's neither even nor prime?\n\nLet's see. \n\n1: Not even, not prime. So, \u00acP(1) is true, \u00acQ(1) is true. Therefore, \u00acP(1) \u2227 \u00acQ(1) is true. So, such an x exists (x=1). Hence, part d) is true.\n\nLet me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. \n\na) True because 2 is both even and prime.\nb) False because 2 is even and prime.\nc) False because 2 is prime and even.\nd) True because 1 is neither even nor prime.\n\nYep, that seems right. I think I've covered all the points.\nDONE.\n</think>\n\na) True  \nb) False  \nc) False  \nd) True  \n\nDONE."

Let me take it step by step because I want to make sure I understand everything correctly.\n\nFirst, let's understand the universe of discourse. It's the positive integers from 1 to 5, inclusive. So, the numbers we're dealing with are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.\n\nNext, there are two predicates defined here: P(x) and Q(x). P(x) is the predicate 'x is even,' and Q(x) is the predicate 'x is prime.' Okay, so for each number in our universe, I need to determine whether it is even and whether it is prime.\n\nLet me list out the numbers and check these predicates for each one:\n\n1. **Number 1**:\n   - P(1): Is 1 even? No, because even numbers are divisible by 2, and 1 divided by 2 is not an integer. So, P(1) is false.\n   - Q(1): Is 1 a prime number? Hmm, I recall that a prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. Since 1 only has one divisor, which is itself, some mathematicians don't consider 1 as a prime number. So, Q(1) is false.\n\n2. **Number 2**:\n   - P(2): Is 2 even? Yes, because 2 divided by 2 is 1, which is an integer. So, P(2) is true.\n   - Q(2): Is 2 a prime number? Yes, because its only divisors are 1 and 2. So, Q(2) is true.\n\n3. **Number 3**:\n   - P(3): Is 3 even? No, similar to 1, it's not divisible by 2 without a remainder. So, P(3) is false.\n   - Q(3): Is 3 a prime number? Yes, since it's only divisible by 1 and 3. So, Q(3) is true.\n\n4. **Number 4**:\n   - P(4): Is 4 even? Yes, because 4 divided by 2 is 2. So, P(4) is true.\n   - Q(4): Is 4 a prime number? No, because it's divisible by 1, 2, and 4. So, Q(4) is false.\n\n5. **Number 5**:\n   - P(5): Is 5 even? No, same reasoning as 1 and 3. So, P(5) is false.\n   - Q(5): Is 5 a prime number? Yes, as its only divisors are 1 and 5. So, Q(5) is true.\n\nAlright, so now I have the truth values for P(x) and Q(x) for each number from 1 to 5. Let me summarize this:\n\n- 1: P(false), Q(false)\n- 2: P(true), Q(true)\n- 3: P(false), Q(true)\n- 4: P(true), Q(false)\n- 5: P(false), Q(true)\n\nNow, let's tackle each statement one by one.\n\n**a) \u2203x(P(x) \u2227 Q(x))**\n\nThis is an existential quantifier, meaning \"there exists an x such that P(x) and Q(x) are both true.\" So, I need to check if there's any number in our universe where both P(x) is true (even) and Q(x) is true (prime).\n\nLooking at the list above:\n\n- Number 2: P=true, Q=true \u2192 satisfies both conditions.\n- Number 3: P=false, Q=true \u2192 doesn't satisfy P.\n- Number 4: P=true, Q=false \u2192 doesn't satisfy Q.\n- Number 5: P=false, Q=true \u2192 doesn't satisfy P.\n\nSo, since number 2 satisfies both P and Q, the statement \u2203x(P(x) \u2227 Q(x)) is true.\n\n**b) \u2200x(P(x) \u2192 \u00acQ(x))**\n\nThis is a universal quantifier, meaning \"for all x, if P(x) is true, then Q(x) is false.\" In logical terms, this is equivalent to saying that whenever a number is even, it is not prime.\n\nLet me analyze each number:\n\n- Number 1: P(false) \u2192 regardless of Q, the implication is true.\n- Number 2: P(true) \u2192 Q(false). So, is 2 even? Yes. Is 2 prime? Yes. Wait, that's a problem. If P(x) is true, then Q(x) must be false. But here, when P(x) is true (for 2), Q(x) is actually true. That means the implication fails for x=2. Therefore, the statement \u2200x(P(x) \u2192 \u00acQ(x)) is false.\n\n**c) \u2200x(Q(x) \u2192 \u00acP(x))**\n\nThis is another universal quantifier, meaning \"for all x, if Q(x) is true, then P(x) is false.\" In other words, all prime numbers in this universe are not even.\n\nLooking at our list:\n\n- Number 1: Q(false) \u2192 implication is true.\n- Number 2: Q(true) \u2192 P(false). Is 2 prime? Yes. Is 2 even? Yes. So, the implication here is false because Q is true, but P is also true. So, the statement fails for x=2.\n- Number 3: Q(true) \u2192 P(false). 3 is prime, and 3 is not even. So, this implication holds.\n- Number 4: Q(false) \u2192 implication holds.\n- Number 5: Q(true) \u2192 P(false). 5 is prime and not even. So, implication holds.\n\nBut since it fails for x=2, the entire statement \u2200x(Q(x) \u2192 \u00acP(x)) is false.\n\n**d) \u2203x(\u00acP(x) \u2227 \u00acQ(x))**\n\nThis is another existential quantifier, meaning \"there exists an x such that P(x) is false and Q(x) is false.\" In other words, there is a number that is neither even nor prime.\n\nLooking at our list:\n\n- Number 1: \u00acP(true) \u2227 \u00acQ(true). Is 1 even? No, so \u00acP is true. Is 1 prime? No, so \u00acQ is true. Therefore, number 1 satisfies both \u00acP and \u00acQ.\n- Number 2: \u00acP(false) \u2227 \u00acQ(false). Doesn't satisfy.\n- Number 3: \u00acP(true) \u2227 \u00acQ(false). Doesn't satisfy because \u00acQ is false.\n- Number 4: \u00acP(false) \u2227 \u00acQ(true). Doesn't satisfy.\n- Number 5: \u00acP(true) \u2227 \u00acQ(false). Doesn't satisfy because \u00acQ is false.\n\nSo, number 1 satisfies both \u00acP and \u00acQ, making the statement \u2203x(\u00acP(x) \u2227 \u00acQ(x)) true.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that 1 is not considered prime, so \u00acQ(1) is true. And 1 is not even, so \u00acP(1) is true. Therefore, yes, 1 is the number that is neither even nor prime. Therefore, this statement is true.\n\nWait, but I remember that 1 is sometimes excluded from primes, but in this case, since the predicate Q(x) is defined as 'x is prime,' and 1 is not prime, \u00acQ(1) is true. So, yes, 1 qualifies.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\na) True\n\nb) False\n\nc) False\n\nd) True\n\nLet me just double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFor a), number 2 is even and prime, so that's correct.\n\nFor b), since 2 is even and prime, the implication fails, so b) is false.\n\nFor c), again, 2 is prime and even, so the implication fails, making c) false.\n\nFor d), number 1 is neither even nor prime, so it satisfies \u00acP and \u00acQ, making d) true.\n\nAlright, I think that's all correct.\nDONE.\n</think>\n\nAlright, let's break down each statement step by step based on the given universe and predicates.\n\n**a) \u2203x(P(x) \u2227 Q(x))**\n\n- **Analysis**: We need to check if there exists an x in {1,2,3,4,5} such that x is even and prime.\n- **Result**: Number 2 is even (P(2) = true) and prime (Q(2) = true). Therefore, the statement is true.\n\n**b) \u2200x(P(x) \u2192 \u00acQ(x))**\n\n- **Analysis**: For every x, if x is even, then x is not prime.\n- **Result**: Number 2 is even (P(2) = true) and prime (Q(2) = true).

Let me try to figure it out step by step. \n\nFirst, the universe of discourse is the positive integers {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. So, we're dealing with numbers 1 through 5. Got that. \n\nNow, P(x) is the predicate 'x is even', and Q(x) is the predicate 'x is prime'. I need to evaluate four different statements: a, b, c, and d. Each one involves some combination of P(x) and Q(x), and I have to determine if each statement is true or false. \n\nLet's start with statement a: \u2203x(P(x) \u2227 Q(x)). This reads as \"There exists an x such that x is even and x is prime.\" So, in other words, is there a number between 1 and 5 that is both even and prime? \n\nWell, let's list out the even numbers in this range. The even numbers are 2, 4. Now, which of these are prime? 2 is a prime number because it's only divisible by 1 and itself. 4, on the other hand, is not prime because it can be divided by 1, 2, and 4. So, 2 is both even and prime. Therefore, there exists such an x, which is 2. So statement a is true.\n\nMoving on to statement b: \u2200x(P(x) \u2192 \u00acQ(x)). This translates to \"For all x, if x is even, then x is not prime.\" In logical terms, this is saying that no even number in our universe is prime. Is that true? \n\nLooking back at statement a, we saw that 2 is even and prime. So, if we apply this to statement b, since 2 is even (P(2) is true) and also prime (Q(2) is true), the implication P(x) \u2192 \u00acQ(x) would be false for x=2. Because if P(x) is true, \u00acQ(x) has to be true for the implication to hold. But since Q(2) is true, \u00acQ(2) is false, making the implication false. Therefore, statement b is false because there exists an x (specifically x=2) where the implication fails. So b is false.\n\nNow, statement c: \u2200x(Q(x) \u2192 \u00acP(x)). This means \"For all x, if x is prime, then x is not even.\" So, is it true that no prime number in our universe is even? \n\nLooking at our numbers again, the prime numbers in {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} are 2, 3, and 5. Among these, 2 is even, but 3 and 5 are odd. So, for x=2, Q(2) is true because 2 is prime, and P(2) is also true because 2 is even. Therefore, Q(2) \u2192 \u00acP(2) would be false because Q(2) is true and \u00acP(2) is false. Hence, the implication fails for x=2, making statement c false. \n\nAlternatively, even if we consider other primes like 3 and 5, they are not even, so the implication holds for them, but since it fails for x=2, the entire statement c is false. \n\nFinally, statement d: \u2203x(\u00acP(x) \u2227 \u00acQ(x)). This translates to \"There exists an x such that x is not even and x is not prime.\" So, is there a number in our universe that is neither even nor prime? \n\nLet's check each number:\n\n1: Not even (\u00acP(1)) and not prime (\u00acQ(1)). So, 1 satisfies both conditions.\n\n2: Even (P(2)) and prime (Q(2)). So, \u00acP(2) is false and \u00acQ(2) is false. Doesn't satisfy.\n\n3: Not even (\u00acP(3)) and prime (Q(3)). So, \u00acP(3) is true, but \u00acQ(3) is false. Doesn't satisfy.\n\n4: Even (P(4)) and not prime (\u00acQ(4)). So, \u00acP(4) is false and \u00acQ(4) is true. Doesn't satisfy.\n\n5: Not even (\u00acP(5)) and not prime (\u00acQ(5)). So, 5 satisfies both conditions.\n\nWait, both 1 and 5 satisfy \u00acP(x) \u2227 \u00acQ(x). So, there definitely exists such x. Therefore, statement d is true.\n\nLet me just recap:\n\na) True because 2 is both even and prime.\n\nb) False because 2 is even and prime, making the implication false.\n\nc) False because 2 is prime and even, making the implication false.\n\nd) True because 1 and 5 are neither even nor prime.\n\nI think that's all. Let me make sure I didn't miss anything. For statement c, it's about primes being non-even. Since 2 is prime and even, the statement fails. For statement b, it's about even numbers not being prime, but 2 is both, so it fails. Statements a and d are about existence, and since we found 2 and 1 and 5, respectively, they are true. Yep, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\na) True\n\nb) False\n\nc) False\n\nd) True\n\nDONE."

The universe of discourse is the set of positive integers from 1 to 5. That means we're only considering numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. \n\nFirst, let me note down the predicates given:\n\n- P(x): x is even.\n- Q(x): x is prime.\n\nI need to evaluate four statements: a, b, c, and d. Each of these is a logical statement involving P(x) and Q(x). Let me take them one by one.\n\nStarting with part a: \u2203x(P(x) \u2227 Q(x)). This reads as \"There exists an x such that x is even and x is prime.\" So, I'm looking for a number between 1 and 5 that is both even and prime. \n\nLet me list the even numbers in the universe: 2, 4. Now, which of these are prime? \n\n- 2 is a prime number because its only divisors are 1 and itself.\n- 4 is not a prime number because it can be divided by 1, 2, and 4.\n\nSo, 2 is both even and prime. That means there exists such an x (specifically, x=2). Therefore, statement a is true.\n\nMoving on to part b: \u2200x(P(x) \u2192 \u00acQ(x)). This is a universal statement: For all x, if x is even, then x is not prime. Let me parse this. For each number from 1 to 5, if it's even, then it's not prime.\n\nLet's check each even number:\n\n- 2: Even and prime. So, P(2) is true, but Q(2) is also true. Therefore, the implication P(2) \u2192 \u00acQ(2) would be False, because we have True \u2192 False. \n\nSince there exists at least one x (specifically x=2) where the implication is false, the universal statement \u2200x(P(x) \u2192 \u00acQ(x)) is false.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me double-check that. The implication P(x) \u2192 \u00acQ(x) is only false when P(x) is true and Q(x) is true. So, for x=2, P(x) is true, and Q(x) is also true, making the implication false. Therefore, since the statement is \u2200x(...), which requires the implication to hold for all x, but it fails for x=2, the entire statement is false. So, yes, part b is false.\n\nNow, part c: \u2200x(Q(x) \u2192 \u00acP(x)). This translates to \"For all x, if x is prime, then x is not even.\" So, for every prime number in our universe, it should not be even.\n\nLet's list the prime numbers in our universe: 2, 3, 5.\n\n- 2: Even and prime. So, Q(2) is true, P(2) is true. Therefore, the implication Q(2) \u2192 \u00acP(2) is False, since True \u2192 False is False.\n- 3: Odd and prime. So, Q(3) is true, P(3) is false. Therefore, the implication Q(3) \u2192 \u00acP(3) is True, because True \u2192 True is True.\n- 5: Odd and prime. Similar to 3, Q(5) is true, P(5) is false. So, implication is True.\n\nSo, for x=2, the implication fails, making the universal statement \u2200x(...) false. Therefore, part c is false.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The statement says that for all x, if x is prime, then it's not even. But 2 is a prime and even, so this directly contradicts the statement. Hence, the statement is false.\n\nFinally, part d: \u2203x(\u00acP(x) \u2227 \u00acQ(x)). This reads as \"There exists an x such that x is not even and x is not prime.\" So, I'm looking for a number between 1 and 5 that is neither even nor prime.\n\nLet me list the numbers and check their properties:\n\n- 1: Not even, not prime. So, \u00acP(1) is true, \u00acQ(1) is true. Therefore, 1 satisfies \u00acP(x) \u2227 \u00acQ(x).\n- 2: Even and prime.\n- 3: Not even, prime.\n- 4: Even, not prime.\n- 5: Not even, prime.\n\nSo, x=1 is the number that is neither even nor prime. Therefore, such an x exists, making statement d true.\n\nTo recap:\n\na) True, because 2 is even and prime.\nb) False, because 2 is even and prime, making the implication false.\nc) False, because 2 is prime and even, making the implication false.\nd) True, because 1 is neither even nor prime.\n\nI think that covers all parts. I should make sure I didn't miss any numbers or misclassify any as prime or even. Let me double-check:\n\nPrimes between 1-5: 2,3,5. Correct.\n\nEvens between 1-5: 2,4. Correct.\n\nNumber 1: Neither prime nor composite, so neither P nor Q holds. So, \u00acP(1) and \u00acQ(1) are both true.

Let me first understand what's being asked. The problem is about determining whether four different statements are true or false in a universe of discourse that includes the positive integers {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. We have two predicates here: P(x), which means \"x is even,\" and Q(x), which means \"x is prime.\" \n\nThere are four statements to evaluate: a, b, c, and d. I need to go through each one systematically. Let me start by recalling what each logical connective means because I think that will help me analyze each statement.\n\nFirst, some background:\n- P(x) is \"x is even.\" So, in our universe, the even numbers are 2, 4. So P(x) is true for x=2 and x=4, and false otherwise (for 1, 3, 5).\n- Q(x) is \"x is prime.\" In our universe, primes are 2, 3, 5. So Q(x) is true for x=2, 3, 5, and false otherwise (for 1, 4).\n\nNow, let's go through each statement one by one.\n\n**a) \u2203x(P(x) \u2227 Q(x))**\n\nThis is an existential quantifier: \"There exists an x such that P(x) and Q(x) are both true.\" In other words, there is at least one number in our set that is both even and prime.\n\nFrom what I know, 2 is the only even prime number. Let's check: 2 is in our universe, it's even, and it's prime. So P(2) is true, Q(2) is true. Therefore, P(2) \u2227 Q(2) is true. Since there exists such an x (specifically x=2), the statement \u2203x(P(x) \u2227 Q(x)) is true.\n\nSo, statement a is true.\n\n**b) \u2200x(P(x) \u2192 \u00acQ(x))**\n\nThis is a universal quantifier: \"For all x, if P(x) is true, then Q(x) is false.\" In other words, every even number in our set is not prime.\n\nLet me think. P(x) is true for x=2 and x=4. So let's check Q(x) for these x's.\n\nFor x=2: P(2) is true, and Q(2) is true. So P(2) \u2192 \u00acQ(2) would mean \"If x is even, then x is not prime.\" But in this case, P(2) is true, but \u00acQ(2) is false because Q(2) is true. So the implication P(2) \u2192 \u00acQ(2) is false because a true statement leading to a false statement makes the implication false.\n\nSimilarly, for x=4: P(4) is true, and Q(4) is false. So P(4) \u2192 \u00acQ(4) becomes \"If x is even, then x is not prime.\" Here, P(4) is true, and \u00acQ(4) is true because Q(4) is false. So the implication holds as true.\n\nSo, for x=2, the implication is false, and for x=4, it's true. Since the statement is a universal quantifier (for all x), if there's even one x where the implication is false, the entire statement is false. Since x=2 makes it false, statement b is false.\n\n**c) \u2200x(Q(x) \u2192 \u00acP(x))**\n\nThis is another universal quantifier: \"For all x, if Q(x) is true, then P(x) is false.\" In other words, every prime number in our set is not even.\n\nLet's check each prime number in our universe: 2, 3, 5.\n\nFor x=2: Q(2) is true, and P(2) is true. So Q(2) \u2192 \u00acP(2) would mean \"If x is prime, then x is not even.\" Here, Q(2) is true, but P(2) is true, so \u00acP(2) is false. Therefore, the implication is false because a true statement leading to a false statement makes the implication false.\n\nFor x=3: Q(3) is true, and P(3) is false. So Q(3) \u2192 \u00acP(3) becomes \"If x is prime, then x is not even.\" Here, Q(3) is true, and \u00acP(3) is true because P(3) is false. So the implication holds as true.\n\nFor x=5: Q(5) is true, and P(5) is false. So Q(5) \u2192 \u00acP(5) is \"If x is prime, then x is not even,\" which is true because P(5) is false.\n\nSo, the implication is false for x=2 and true for x=3 and x=5. Since the statement is a universal quantifier, if there's any x where the implication is false, the entire statement is false. Since x=2 makes it false, statement c is false.\n\n**d) \u2203x(\u00acP(x) \u2227 \u00acQ(x))**\n\nThis is an existential quantifier: \"There exists an x such that \u00acP(x) is true and \u00acQ(x) is true.\" In other words, there is at least one number in our set that is neither even nor prime.\n\nLet's see. Our universe is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.\n\nCheck each number:\n\n- x=1: \u00acP(1) is true because 1 is not even, and \u00acQ(1) is true because 1 is not prime. So both are true. Therefore, x=1 satisfies \u00acP(x) \u2227 \u00acQ(x). So \u2203x(\u00acP(x) \u2227 \u00acQ(x)) is true because x=1 works.\n\nTherefore, statement d is true.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\na) True\n\nb) False\n\nc) False\n\nd) True\n\nWait, let me double-check each statement to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor statement a, 2 is even and prime, so yes, that's correct.\n\nFor statement b, since 2 is even and prime, the implication fails, making the entire statement false.\n\nFor statement c, since 2 is prime and even, the implication fails, making the entire statement false.\n\nFor statement d, 1 is neither even nor prime, so it works, making the statement true.\n\nI think that's correct.\nDONE.\n</think>\n\na) True\n\nb) False\n\nc) False\n\nd) True\n\nThe solution is:\n\na) True\n\nb) False\n\nc) False\n\nd) True\n\nDONE."

So, we have a universe of discourse which is the set of positive integers {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. We have two predicates: P(x), which means \"x is even,\" and Q(x), which means \"x is prime.\" There are four statements to evaluate, labeled a) through d). Let me go through each one carefully.\n\nStarting with part a): \u2203x(P(x) \u2227 Q(x)). This is an existential quantifier, meaning \"there exists an x such that both P(x) and Q(x) are true.\" So, I need to find if there's any number in {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} that is both even and prime.\n\nFirst, let's list out the even numbers in this set. The numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. The even numbers here are 2 and 4. Now, among these, which are prime? Well, 2 is a prime number because its only divisors are 1 and itself. 4, on the other hand, is not prime because it can be divided by 1, 2, and 4. So, 2 is both even and prime. That means the statement \u2203x(P(x) \u2227 Q(x)) is true because we have x=2 that satisfies both conditions.\n\nMoving on to part b): \u2200x(P(x) \u2192 \u00acQ(x)). This is a universal quantifier, meaning \"for all x, if x is even, then x is not prime.\" So, I need to check if every even number in our set is not prime.\n\nLooking back at the even numbers: 2 and 4. We already know that 2 is prime, which directly contradicts the statement. If 2 is even, then according to the statement, it should not be prime. But 2 is prime, so the implication P(x) \u2192 \u00acQ(x) is false for x=2. Therefore, the universal statement \u2200x(P(x) \u2192 \u00acQ(x)) is false because there's at least one x (specifically x=2) where the implication fails.\n\nNext is part c): \u2200x(Q(x) \u2192 \u00acP(x)). This means \"for all x, if x is prime, then x is not even.\" So, I need to verify that every prime number in our set is odd.\n\nOur prime numbers in {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} are 2, 3, and 5. Checking each:\n\n- 2 is even, but it's prime. So, if x=2, Q(x) is true, but P(x) is also true, which violates the implication because Q(x) \u2192 \u00acP(x) would require that if x is prime, it's not even. But 2 is both prime and even, making the implication false for x=2. Therefore, the universal statement \u2200x(Q(x) \u2192 \u00acP(x)) is false because of x=2.\n\nLastly, part d): \u2203x(\u00acP(x) \u2227 \u00acQ(x)). This is an existential quantifier again, meaning \"there exists an x such that x is not even and x is not prime.\" So, we need to find a number in our set that is neither even nor prime.\n\nLooking at the numbers:\n\n- 1: It's not even (so \u00acP(x) is true), and it's not prime (so \u00acQ(x) is true). Therefore, 1 satisfies both conditions. Hence, the statement \u2203x(\u00acP(x) \u2227 \u00acQ(x)) is true because x=1 works.\n\nTo recap:\n\na) True because 2 is both even and prime.\n\nb) False because 2 is even and prime.\n\nc) False because 2 is prime and even.\n\nd) True because 1 is neither even nor prime.\n\nDONE.\n</think>\n\na) True\n\nb) False\n\nc) False\n\nd) True\n\nDONE."

Let me try to break it down step by step. The universe of discourse is the set of positive integers from 1 to 5, so that's {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. \n\nFirst, let's understand the predicates:\n\n- P(x) is \"x is even.\"\n- Q(x) is \"x is prime.\"\n\nI need to evaluate four statements (a to d) and determine if each is true or false. Let's take them one by one.\n\nStarting with statement a: \u2203x(P(x) \u2227 Q(x)). This reads as \"There exists an x such that x is even and x is prime.\" So, I need to see if there's any number between 1 and 5 that is both even and prime.\n\nLet me list out the numbers:\n\n1: Not prime (by definition, primes are greater than 1)\n2: Prime and even\n3: Prime but odd\n4: Even but not prime\n5: Prime and odd\n\nSo, 2 is both even and prime. That means statement a is true because such an x exists (x=2).\n\nMoving on to statement b: \u2200x(P(x) \u2192 \u00acQ(x)). This translates to \"For all x, if x is even, then x is not prime.\" I need to check if every even number in the set is not prime.\n\nLooking at the numbers again:\n\n2: Even and prime. So, if x=2, P(x) is true, but Q(x) is also true. Therefore, P(x) \u2192 \u00acQ(x) would be false because the implication is only true if whenever P(x) is true, Q(x) is false. Since for x=2, both are true, the implication fails. Therefore, statement b is false.\n\nNext is statement c: \u2200x(Q(x) \u2192 \u00acP(x)). This means \"For all x, if x is prime, then x is not even.\" Let's check each prime number in the set.\n\nPrimes in {1,2,3,4,5} are 2, 3, and 5.\n\n- 2: Prime and even. So, Q(x) is true, but P(x) is also true. Therefore, Q(x) \u2192 \u00acP(x) is false because the implication is only true if whenever Q(x) is true, P(x) is false. Since for x=2, P(x) is true, the implication fails. Hence, statement c is false.\n\nLastly, statement d: \u2203x(\u00acP(x) \u2227 \u00acQ(x)). This reads \"There exists an x such that x is not even and x is not prime.\" Let's see if such a number exists in our set.\n\nLooking at the numbers:\n\n1: Not even (\u00acP(x)) and not prime (\u00acQ(x)). So, x=1 satisfies both conditions. Therefore, statement d is true because such an x exists.\n\nTo recap:\n\na) True (2 is even and prime)\nb) False (2 is even and prime)\nc) False (2 is prime and even)\nd) True (1 is neither even nor prime)\n\nI think that covers all the statements. Let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nFor statement a, 2 is definitely both even and prime. No issues there.\n\nFor statement b, since 2 is a counterexample, the universal statement is false.\n\nFor statement c, again, 2 is a counterexample because it's prime and even.\n\nFor statement d, 1 is not even and not prime, so it's a valid example. \n\nYeah, that seems correct.\nDONE.\n</think>\n\na) True  \nb) False  \nc) False  \nd) True  \n\nDONE."
