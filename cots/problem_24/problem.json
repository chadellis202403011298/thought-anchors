  "question": "A local health department wants to estimate the proportion of adults in a city who have received a particular vaccine. They decide to survey 400 randomly selected adults from the city, which has a population of 50,000 adults. The survey finds that 280 of the sampled adults have received the vaccine. If we want to construct a 95% confidence interval for the true proportion of vaccinated adults in the city, which of the following sampling methods would be most appropriate, and what is the margin of error for this estimate (rounded to three decimal places)?",
  "answer": "The most appropriate sampling method for this scenario is Simple Random Sampling, where each adult in the city has an equal probability of being selected for the survey.\n\nTo calculate the margin of error for the 95% confidence interval, we use the formula:\n\nMargin of Error = z* \u00d7 \u221a[p\u0302(1-p\u0302)/n]\n\nWhere:\n- z* is the critical value for the desired confidence level (for 95% confidence, z* = 1.96)\n- p\u0302 is the sample proportion (280/400 = 0.7)\n- n is the sample size (400)\n\nCalculation:\nMargin of Error = 1.96 \u00d7 \u221a[(0.7 \u00d7 0.3)/400]\nMargin of Error = 1.96 \u00d7 \u221a[0.21/400]\nMargin of Error = 1.96 \u00d7 \u221a0.000525\nMargin of Error = 1.96 \u00d7 0.0229\nMargin of Error = 0.0449 \u2248 0.045\n\nTherefore, the margin of error is 0.045 or 4.5%.\n\nWith Simple Random Sampling and a margin of error of 0.045, we can construct a 95% confidence interval for the true proportion as 0.7 \u00b1 0.045, or (0.655, 0.745). This means we are 95% confident that the true proportion of vaccinated adults in the city is between 65.5% and 74.5%."
