  "question": "A researcher is analyzing temperature readings collected over several days. The sequence below shows hourly temperatures (in \u00b0C) recorded during a 24-hour period:\n\n22, 21, 20, 19, 18, 17, 18, 20, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 32, 31, 30, 28, 26, 25, 24, 23, 22, 43, 21\n\nBy examining the pattern of temperature changes throughout the day, identify the anomalous reading that doesn't fit the expected pattern. Explain why this reading is an anomaly.",
  "answer": "The anomalous reading in the sequence is 43\u00b0C, which appears as the 23rd value in the sequence.\n\nStep 1: Identify the expected pattern.\nLooking at the sequence 22, 21, 20, 19, 18, 17, 18, 20, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 32, 31, 30, 28, 26, 25, 24, 23, 22, 43, 21, we can see it follows a natural daily temperature cycle:\n- Temperatures decrease during the night (values 22 down to 17)\n- Increase during the morning and reach peak in the afternoon (values 18 up to 32)\n- Then gradually decrease again as evening approaches (values 31 down to 22)\n- The final value of 21 continues this downward trend\n\nStep 2: Identify the anomaly.\nThe value 43 breaks this pattern drastically. It appears between 22 and 21, which are part of the gradual evening cooling pattern. A sudden jump from 22\u00b0C to 43\u00b0C and then back down to 21\u00b0C is not consistent with natural temperature fluctuations over a short period.\n\nStep 3: Confirm the anomaly.\nThe magnitude of the deviation (a 21\u00b0C jump from the previous reading) is much larger than any other change in the sequence. The largest non-anomalous change is only 3\u00b0C between consecutive readings. Additionally, 43\u00b0C would be an unusually high temperature in the context of the other readings, which peak at 32\u00b0C.\n\nTherefore, 43\u00b0C is clearly an anomalous reading, likely caused by a measurement error, sensor malfunction, or data recording issue."
