  "question": "A researcher is studying the effect of a new fertilizer on plant growth. She sets up an experiment with two groups of identical plants: a control group using standard fertilizer and an experimental group using the new fertilizer. After 30 days, she measures the height (in cm) of each plant. The results are as follows:\n\nControl group: 15, 17, 14, 16, 15, 18, 16, 15\nExperimental group: 18, 20, 17, 19, 21, 18, 20, 19\n\nBased on this data, answer the following questions:\n1. What is the mean (average) height for each group?\n2. What is the range (difference between maximum and minimum values) for each group?\n3. Can the researcher reasonably conclude that the new fertilizer is more effective? Why or why not?",
  "answer": "Let's analyze this data step by step:\n\n1. Mean (average) height calculation:\n   - Control group: (15 + 17 + 14 + 16 + 15 + 18 + 16 + 15) \u00f7 8 = 126 \u00f7 8 = 15.75 cm\n   - Experimental group: (18 + 20 + 17 + 19 + 21 + 18 + 20 + 19) \u00f7 8 = 152 \u00f7 8 = 19 cm\n\n2. Range calculation:\n   - Control group: Maximum (18 cm) - Minimum (14 cm) = 4 cm\n   - Experimental group: Maximum (21 cm) - Minimum (17 cm) = 4 cm\n\n3. Conclusion about effectiveness:\n   Yes, the researcher can reasonably conclude that the new fertilizer appears more effective because:\n   \n   - The experimental group has a higher mean height (19 cm) compared to the control group (15.75 cm), showing an average increase of 3.25 cm.\n   - Every single plant in the experimental group grew taller than the average height of the control group.\n   - The range is the same for both groups (4 cm), suggesting similar consistency in results.\n   - The data shows a clear pattern with no overlapping values between groups (the smallest plant in the experimental group at 17 cm is taller than all but one plant in the control group).\n   \n   However, to strengthen this conclusion, the researcher should ideally conduct a statistical test (like a t-test) to confirm the statistical significance of this difference and repeat the experiment to verify consistent results."
