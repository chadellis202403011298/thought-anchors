Express your answer in terms of the given symbols.",
  "answer": "To solve this problem, I need to determine what each symbol represents by analyzing the given equations.\n\nStep 1: Start with the equation \u25c6 + \u25c6 = \u2b50\nThis means that \u25c6 + \u25c6 = \u2b50, or 2\u25c6 = \u2b50, which means \u25c6 = \u2b50/2.\n\nStep 2: Use the first equation \u2b50 + \u25c6 = \u25b2\nSubstituting what we know about \u25c6: \u2b50 + (\u2b50/2) = \u25b2\nSimplifying: (2\u2b50)/2 + (\u2b50/2) = \u25b2\nFurther simplifying: (2\u2b50 + \u2b50)/2 = \u25b2\nTherefore: (3\u2b50)/2 = \u25b2, which means \u25b2 = (3\u2b50)/2\n\nStep 3: Use the third equation \u25b2 - \u25c6 = \u2666\nSubstituting what we know: (3\u2b50)/2 - (\u2b50/2) = \u2666\nSimplifying: ((3\u2b50) - \u2b50)/2 = \u2666\nFurther simplifying: (2\u2b50)/2 = \u2666\nTherefore: \u2666 = \u2b50\n\nStep 4: Find \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6\nWe know that \u25c6 = \u2b50/2\nSo: \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = \u2b50 \u00d7 (\u2b50/2) = (\u2b50\u00b2)/2\n\nStep 5: Express the answer in terms of the given symbols\nSince we don't have a direct symbol for (\u2b50\u00b2)/2, I need to use our existing relationships.\n\nWe know that:\n- \u2666 = \u2b50\n- \u25c6 = \u2b50/2\n- \u25b2 = (3\u2b50)/2\n\nLooking at these relationships, we can write \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 as \u2b50 \u00d7 (\u2b50/2) = (\u2b50\u00b2)/2 = \u2b50 \u00d7 \u2666/2 = \u2666 \u00d7 \u2666/2\n\nThe simplest expression is: \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = \u2666 \u00d7 (\u25c6/\u2b50) \u00d7 \u2b50 = \u2666 \u00d7 \u25c6\n\nTherefore, \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = \u2666 \u00d7 \u25c6"
