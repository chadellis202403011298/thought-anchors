End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: In a symbolic substitution system, the following equations are true:\n\n\u2b50 + \u25c6 = \u25b2\n\u25c6 + \u25c6 = \u2b50\n\u25b2 - \u25c6 = \u2666\n\u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = ?\n\nIf each symbol represents a consistent value throughout the system, what does \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 equal? Express your answer in terms of the given symbols. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I've got this symbolic substitution system with four symbols: \u2b50, \u25c6, \u25b2, and \u2666. The equations given are:\n\n1. \u2b50 + \u25c6 = \u25b2\n2. \u25c6 + \u25c6 = \u2b50\n3. \u25b2 - \u25c6 = \u2666\n4. \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = ?\n\nI need to find out what \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 equals, expressing the answer in terms of the given symbols. Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at equation 1: \u2b50 + \u25c6 = \u25b2. That means the sum of \u2b50 and \u25c6 gives \u25b2. So, maybe I can express \u25b2 in terms of \u2b50 and \u25c6. Let me write that down:\n\n\u25b2 = \u2b50 + \u25c6\n\nCool, so \u25b2 is just \u2b50 plus \u25c6. Now, moving on to equation 2: \u25c6 + \u25c6 = \u2b50. That simplifies to 2\u25c6 = \u2b50. So, \u2b50 is twice the value of \u25c6. Got it. Let's note that:\n\n\u2b50 = 2 \u00d7 \u25c6\n\nAlright, so now I have \u2b50 in terms of \u25c6. Maybe I can substitute this into the first equation to find \u25b2 in terms of \u25c6 as well. Let's try that.\n\nFrom equation 1: \u25b2 = \u2b50 + \u25c6\n\nSubstituting \u2b50 from equation 2: \u25b2 = (2 \u00d7 \u25c6) + \u25c6\n\nSo, \u25b2 = 3 \u00d7 \u25c6\n\nOkay, so \u25b2 is three times \u25c6. That's helpful. Now, moving on to equation 3: \u25b2 - \u25c6 = \u2666. We already know that \u25b2 is 3 \u00d7 \u25c6, so let's substitute that in.\n\n\u25b2 - \u25c6 = (3 \u00d7 \u25c6) - \u25c6 = 2 \u00d7 \u25c6 = \u2666\n\nSo, \u2666 equals 2 \u00d7 \u25c6. That gives us another relationship: \u2666 = 2 \u00d7 \u25c6\n\nNow, summarizing what we have so far:\n\n- \u2b50 = 2 \u00d7 \u25c6\n- \u25b2 = 3 \u00d7 \u25c6\n- \u2666 = 2 \u00d7 \u25c6\n\nInteresting, so both \u2b50 and \u2666 are equal to 2 \u00d7 \u25c6. That means \u2b50 = \u2666. That's a useful piece of information.\n\nNow, the question is asking for \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6. Let's compute that:\n\n\u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = (2 \u00d7 \u25c6) \u00d7 \u25c6 = 2 \u00d7 \u25c6 \u00d7 \u25c6 = 2 \u00d7 (\u25c6 \u00d7 \u25c6)\n\nHmm, so that's 2 times the square of \u25c6. But I need to express the answer in terms of the given symbols, not in terms of \u25c6 squared. Maybe I can find a way to express \u25c6 squared in terms of the other symbols.\n\nLooking back at what we have:\n\nFrom equation 2, we know that 2\u25c6 = \u2b50. So, if I solve for \u25c6, I get:\n\n\u25c6 = \u2b50 / 2\n\nSo, \u25c6 = (1/2) \u00d7 \u2b50\n\nSimilarly, from equation 3, we have \u2666 = 2 \u00d7 \u25c6, so:\n\n\u25c6 = \u2666 / 2\n\nSo, both expressions for \u25c6 are the same, which is consistent.\n\nWait, but I need to find a way to express \u25c6 squared in terms of other symbols. Let me think.\n\nFrom equation 2: 2\u25c6 = \u2b50 \u21d2 \u25c6 = \u2b50 / 2\n\nSo, \u25c6 squared is (\u2b50 / 2)^2 = \u2b50\u00b2 / 4\n\nTherefore, 2 \u00d7 (\u25c6 \u00d7 \u25c6) = 2 \u00d7 (\u2b50\u00b2 / 4) = (2 / 4) \u00d7 \u2b50\u00b2 = (1/2) \u00d7 \u2b50\u00b2\n\nSo, \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = (1/2) \u00d7 \u2b50\u00b2\n\nBut the question asks to express the answer in terms of the given symbols, which are \u2b50, \u25c6, \u25b2, and \u2666. So, I need to see if I can write (1/2) \u00d7 \u2b50\u00b2 using these symbols without introducing fractions or squares.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express it using \u25b2 or \u2666 since I have relationships between them.\n\nFrom earlier, we know that \u25b2 = 3 \u00d7 \u25c6 and \u2666 = 2 \u00d7 \u25c6. So, perhaps I can express \u2b50 in terms of \u25b2 or \u2666.\n\nWait, but \u2b50 = 2 \u00d7 \u25c6, and \u25b2 = 3 \u00d7 \u25c6, so the ratio of \u2b50 to \u25b2 is 2/3. That might not help directly.\n\nAlternatively, since \u2666 = 2 \u00d7 \u25c6, then \u25c6 = \u2666 / 2. So, substituting back into \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6:\n\n\u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = \u2b50 \u00d7 (\u2666 / 2) = (\u2b50 \u00d7 \u2666) / 2\n\nHmm, that's another way to express it, but it still has both \u2b50 and \u2666, which might not be helpful.\n\nAlternatively, since \u25b2 = 3 \u00d7 \u25c6, then \u25c6 = \u25b2 / 3. So:\n\n\u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = \u2b50 \u00d7 (\u25b2 / 3) = (\u2b50 \u00d7 \u25b2) / 3\n\nAgain, not sure if that's useful, but it's another expression.\n\nWait, maybe I can find a relationship that allows me to express \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 in terms of known quantities.\n\nFrom earlier, I have:\n\n- \u2b50 = 2 \u00d7 \u25c6\n- \u25b2 = 3 \u00d7 \u25c6\n- \u2666 = 2 \u00d7 \u25c6\n\nSo, all three symbols \u2b50, \u25b2, and \u2666 are proportional to \u25c6. Specifically, they are multiples of \u25c6. So, perhaps I can find a way to express the product \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 in terms of these multiples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that \u2b50 = 2 \u00d7 \u25c6 and \u25b2 = 3 \u00d7 \u25c6 to express \u25c6 in terms of \u2b50 and \u25b2, and then substitute back into the product.\n\nFrom \u2b50 = 2 \u00d7 \u25c6, we have \u25c6 = \u2b50 / 2\n\nFrom \u25b2 = 3 \u00d7 \u25c6, we have \u25c6 = \u25b2 / 3\n\nSo, both expressions must be equal: \u2b50 / 2 = \u25b2 / 3 \u21d2 3 \u00d7 \u2b50 = 2 \u00d7 \u25b2 \u21d2 3\u2b50 = 2\u25b2\n\nSo, 3\u2b50 = 2\u25b2 \u21d2 \u25b2 = (3/2) \u00d7 \u2b50\n\nWait, but earlier I had \u25b2 = 3 \u00d7 \u25c6, and now I have \u25b2 = (3/2) \u00d7 \u2b50. Let me check if that's consistent.\n\nFrom \u2b50 = 2 \u00d7 \u25c6, then \u25b2 = 3 \u00d7 \u25c6 = 3 \u00d7 (\u2b50 / 2) = (3/2) \u00d7 \u2b50. Yes, that's consistent. So, \u25b2 = (3/2) \u00d7 \u2b50\n\nSimilarly, since \u2666 = 2 \u00d7 \u25c6, and \u25c6 = \u2b50 / 2, then \u2666 = 2 \u00d7 (\u2b50 / 2) = \u2b50\n\nSo, \u2666 = \u2b50\n\nThat's interesting, so \u2666 is equal to \u2b50.\n\nWait, that's a key point. So, \u2666 = \u2b50\n\nTherefore, if I have \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6, and I know that \u2666 = \u2b50, perhaps I can substitute that.\n\nBut I'm not sure yet. Let's think differently.\n\nWe need to find \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6. From earlier, we have:\n\n\u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = (2 \u00d7 \u25c6) \u00d7 \u25c6 = 2 \u00d7 \u25c6\u00b2\n\nWe also have from equation 2 that 2\u25c6 = \u2b50, so \u25c6 = \u2b50 / 2\n\nTherefore, \u25c6\u00b2 = (\u2b50\u00b2) / 4\n\nThus, \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = 2 \u00d7 (\u2b50\u00b2 / 4) = (2 / 4) \u00d7 \u2b50\u00b2 = (1/2) \u00d7 \u2b50\u00b2\n\nBut the problem is that we need to express the answer in terms of the given symbols, not in terms of \u2b50 squared.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can express it using \u25b2 or \u2666.\n\nFrom earlier, we have:\n\n- \u25b2 = 3 \u00d7 \u25c6 \u21d2 \u25c6 = \u25b2 / 3\n- \u2b50 = 2 \u00d7 \u25c6 \u21d2 \u2b50 = 2 \u00d7 (\u25b2 / 3) = (2/3) \u00d7 \u25b2\n\nSo, \u2b50 = (2/3) \u00d7 \u25b2\n\nTherefore, \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = (2/3 \u00d7 \u25b2) \u00d7 (\u25b2 / 3) = (2/3) \u00d7 (\u25b2 \u00d7 \u25b2) / 3 = (2/9) \u00d7 \u25b2\u00b2\n\nBut again, this introduces a square, which might not be what we need.\n\nAlternatively, since \u2666 = \u2b50, and we have \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6, but we know that \u2666 = \u2b50, so perhaps:\n\n\u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = (\u2666) \u00d7 \u25c6\n\nBut we also know that \u2666 = 2 \u00d7 \u25c6, so:\n\n\u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = (2 \u00d7 \u25c6) \u00d7 \u25c6 = 2 \u00d7 \u25c6\u00b2\n\nBut that's the same as before.\n\nWait, maybe we can find a way to express \u25c6\u00b2 in terms of the other symbols.\n\nFrom equation 2: 2\u25c6 = \u2b50 \u21d2 \u25c6 = \u2b50 / 2\n\nFrom equation 1: \u25b2 = \u2b50 + \u25c6 = \u2b50 + (\u2b50 / 2) = (3/2) \u00d7 \u2b50\n\nFrom equation 3: \u25b2 - \u25c6 = \u2666 \u21d2 (3/2 \u00d7 \u2b50) - (\u2b50 / 2) = \u2666 \u21d2 (3/2 - 1/2) \u00d7 \u2b50 = \u2666 \u21d2 (2/2) \u00d7 \u2b50 = \u2666 \u21d2 \u2b50 = \u2666\n\nSo, again, we have \u2b50 = \u2666\n\nTherefore, since \u2b50 = \u2666, and from equation 2, 2\u25c6 = \u2b50 \u21d2 2\u25c6 = \u2666\n\nSo, 2\u25c6 = \u2666 \u21d2 \u25c6 = \u2666 / 2\n\nSo, now, let's go back to \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6.\n\n\u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = \u2b50 \u00d7 (\u2666 / 2) = (\u2b50 \u00d7 \u2666) / 2\n\nBut since \u2b50 = \u2666, then:\n\n\u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = (\u2b50 \u00d7 \u2b50) / 2 = \u2b50\u00b2 / 2\n\nBut again, we have a square term. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, since \u25b2 = (3/2) \u00d7 \u2b50, and \u2b50 = \u2666, then \u25b2 = (3/2) \u00d7 \u2666\n\nBut I'm not sure if that helps.\n\nWait, perhaps we can find a way to express \u2b50\u00b2 in terms of \u25b2.\n\nFrom \u25b2 = (3/2) \u00d7 \u2b50, we can write \u2b50 = (2/3) \u00d7 \u25b2\n\nTherefore, \u2b50\u00b2 = (2/3 \u00d7 \u25b2)\u00b2 = (4/9) \u00d7 \u25b2\u00b2\n\nSo, \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = (4/9) \u00d7 \u25b2\u00b2 / 2 = (2/9) \u00d7 \u25b2\u00b2\n\nBut again, introducing a square.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a relationship between the symbols that allows me to express the product without squares.\n\nWait, let's think differently. Maybe we can solve for all variables in terms of one variable and then compute the product.\n\nLet me assign a variable to \u25c6, say, let\u2019s let \u25c6 = x\n\nThen, from equation 2: 2x = \u2b50 \u21d2 \u2b50 = 2x\n\nFrom equation 1: \u25b2 = \u2b50 + \u25c6 = 2x + x = 3x\n\nFrom equation 3: \u25b2 - \u25c6 = 3x - x = 2x = \u2666 \u21d2 \u2666 = 2x\n\nSo, in terms of x:\n\n- \u25c6 = x\n- \u2b50 = 2x\n- \u25b2 = 3x\n- \u2666 = 2x\n\nTherefore, \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = 2x \u00d7 x = 2x\u00b2\n\nBut we need to express this in terms of the given symbols, not in terms of x.\n\nBut since all symbols are expressed in terms of x, perhaps we can express x in terms of another symbol.\n\nFrom \u2b50 = 2x, so x = \u2b50 / 2\n\nSimilarly, from \u25b2 = 3x, so x = \u25b2 / 3\n\nAnd from \u2666 = 2x, so x = \u2666 / 2\n\nSo, all expressions for x are consistent.\n\nTherefore, \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = 2x\u00b2 = 2*(x)\u00b2\n\nBut we need to express x\u00b2 in terms of the symbols.\n\nFrom x = \u2b50 / 2, so x\u00b2 = (\u2b50\u00b2) / 4\n\nThus, \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = 2*(\u2b50\u00b2 / 4) = (2/4)*\u2b50\u00b2 = (1/2)*\u2b50\u00b2\n\nBut again, this brings us back to \u2b50 squared, which we can't avoid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can express x\u00b2 in terms of other symbols.\n\nFrom \u25b2 = 3x, so x = \u25b2 / 3\n\nThus, x\u00b2 = (\u25b2\u00b2) / 9\n\nSo, \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = 2*(\u25b2\u00b2 / 9) = (2/9)*\u25b2\u00b2\n\nBut still, we have a square.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find a way to express the product without squares.\n\nWait, maybe we can use the fact that \u2b50 = \u2666, as we established earlier.\n\nSince \u2b50 = \u2666, then \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = \u2666 \u00d7 \u25c6\n\nBut from equation 3, we have \u2666 = 2\u00d7\u25c6, so:\n\n\u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = (2\u00d7\u25c6) \u00d7 \u25c6 = 2\u00d7\u25c6\u00b2\n\nBut that's the same as before.\n\nAlternatively, since \u2b50 = 2\u00d7\u25c6, and \u25b2 = 3\u00d7\u25c6, perhaps we can express the product in terms of \u25b2.\n\nFrom \u2b50 = 2\u00d7\u25c6, so \u25c6 = \u2b50 / 2\n\nThus, \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = \u2b50 \u00d7 (\u2b50 / 2) = (\u2b50\u00b2) / 2\n\nAgain, same result.\n\nAlternatively, from \u25b2 = 3\u00d7\u25c6, so \u25c6 = \u25b2 / 3\n\nThus, \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = \u2b50 \u00d7 (\u25b2 / 3) = (\u2b50 \u00d7 \u25b2) / 3\n\nBut I don't know if that helps.\n\nWait, maybe I can express the product in terms of both \u25b2 and \u2666.\n\nSince \u2b50 = \u2666, and we have expressions in terms of \u25b2, perhaps:\n\n\u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = \u2666 \u00d7 \u25c6\n\nBut from equation 3, \u2666 = 2\u00d7\u25c6, so:\n\n\u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = (2\u00d7\u25c6) \u00d7 \u25c6 = 2\u00d7\u25c6\u00b2\n\nBut again, same as before.\n\nAlternatively, from equation 2: 2\u25c6 = \u2b50 \u21d2 2\u25c6 = \u2b50 \u21d2 \u2b50 = 2\u25c6\n\nFrom equation 1: \u25b2 = \u2b50 + \u25c6 = 2\u25c6 + \u25c6 = 3\u25c6\n\nFrom equation 3: \u25b2 - \u25c6 = 2\u25c6 \u21d2 3\u25c6 - \u25c6 = 2\u25c6 \u21d2 2\u25c6 = 2\u25c6 \u21d2 consistent.\n\nSo, in terms of \u25c6, we have:\n\n- \u2b50 = 2\u25c6\n- \u25b2 = 3\u25c6\n- \u2666 = 2\u25c6\n\nTherefore, \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = 2\u25c6 \u00d7 \u25c6 = 2\u25c6\u00b2\n\nBut we need to express this in terms of the given symbols without using \u25c6.\n\nSince we have:\n\n- \u2b50 = 2\u25c6\n- \u25b2 = 3\u25c6\n- \u2666 = 2\u25c6\n\nSo, perhaps we can find a relationship that allows us to express \u25c6\u00b2 in terms of other symbols.\n\nFrom \u2b50 = 2\u25c6, we have \u25c6 = \u2b50 / 2\n\nThus, \u25c6\u00b2 = (\u2b50\u00b2) / 4\n\nSo, \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = 2 \u00d7 (\u2b50\u00b2 / 4) = (2 / 4) \u00d7 \u2b50\u00b2 = (1/2) \u00d7 \u2b50\u00b2\n\nBut again, we're stuck with \u2b50 squared.\n\nAlternatively, from \u25b2 = 3\u25c6, we have \u25c6 = \u25b2 / 3\n\nThus, \u25c6\u00b2 = (\u25b2\u00b2) / 9\n\nSo, \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = 2 \u00d7 (\u25b2\u00b2 / 9) = (2/9) \u00d7 \u25b2\u00b2\n\nStill, we have a square term.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find a way to express the product using both \u25b2 and \u2666.\n\nSince we have:\n\n- \u2b50 = 2\u25c6\n- \u25b2 = 3\u25c6\n- \u2666 = 2\u25c6\n\nSo, all three symbols are multiples of \u25c6.

End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: In a symbolic substitution system, the following equations are true:\n\n\u2b50 + \u25c6 = \u25b2\n\u25c6 + \u25c6 = \u2b50\n\u25b2 - \u25c6 = \u2666\n\u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = ?\n\nIf each symbol represents a consistent value throughout the system, what does \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 equal? Express your answer in terms of the given symbols. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I've got this problem here with some symbols and equations. It's a substitution system, which I think means each symbol stands for a number or value. The goal is to find out what \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 equals, expressed in terms of the given symbols. Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, let me write down the equations to have a clear view:\n\n1. \u2b50 + \u25c6 = \u25b2\n2. \u25c6 + \u25c6 = \u2b50\n3. \u25b2 - \u25c6 = \u2666\n4. \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = ?\n\nOkay, so we have four equations here with four symbols: \u2b50, \u25c6, \u25b2, and \u2666. That probably means each symbol can be represented by a unique value, and we can solve for them step by step.\n\nStarting with equation 2: \u25c6 + \u25c6 = \u2b50. That simplifies to 2\u25c6 = \u2b50. So, \u2b50 is twice the value of \u25c6. Let me write that down:\n\n- Equation 2: 2\u25c6 = \u2b50 \u21d2 \u2b50 = 2\u25c6\n\nNow, equation 1: \u2b50 + \u25c6 = \u25b2. Since we know \u2b50 is 2\u25c6, we can substitute that in:\n\n- Equation 1: 2\u25c6 + \u25c6 = \u25b2 \u21d2 3\u25c6 = \u25b2\n\nSo, \u25b2 is three times the value of \u25c6. Got that:\n\n- \u25b2 = 3\u25c6\n\nMoving on to equation 3: \u25b2 - \u25c6 = \u2666. We already know \u25b2 is 3\u25c6, so substituting that in:\n\n- Equation 3: 3\u25c6 - \u25c6 = \u2666 \u21d2 2\u25c6 = \u2666\n\nSo, \u2666 is twice the value of \u25c6. That's straightforward:\n\n- \u2666 = 2\u25c6\n\nNow, let's recap what we have so far:\n\n- \u2b50 = 2\u25c6\n- \u25b2 = 3\u25c6\n- \u2666 = 2\u25c6\n\nSo, all the symbols are expressed in terms of \u25c6. That's helpful because it means we can express everything in terms of one variable, which is \u25c6.\n\nNow, the question is asking for \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6. Let's write that out:\n\n- \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = ?\n\nBut we already know that \u2b50 is equal to 2\u25c6. So substituting that in:\n\n- \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = 2\u25c6 \u00d7 \u25c6\n\nHmm, 2\u25c6 multiplied by \u25c6. Since \u25c6 is a symbol representing a value, let's assume it's a number. So, multiplying 2 times \u25c6 by \u25c6 would be 2 \u00d7 (\u25c6 \u00d7 \u25c6). Wait, but we need to express this in terms of the given symbols, not necessarily numbers. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, since we have expressions for all symbols in terms of \u25c6, maybe we can represent everything in terms of \u25c6 and then compute the product.\n\nBut let's see. Since we have:\n\n- \u2b50 = 2\u25c6\n- \u25b2 = 3\u25c6\n- \u2666 = 2\u25c6\n\nWe can see that all other symbols are directly related to \u25c6. So, when we compute \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6, which is 2\u25c6 \u00d7 \u25c6, that equals 2\u25c6\u00b2. But we need to express the answer in terms of the given symbols, not necessarily numerical values.\n\nWait a minute, maybe we can find the value of \u25c6 first. If we can express everything in terms of \u25c6, and if we have enough equations, perhaps we can find the numerical value of \u25c6.\n\nLet me see if we can do that. We have:\n\n- \u2b50 = 2\u25c6\n- \u25b2 = 3\u25c6\n- \u2666 = 2\u25c6\n\nBut we need another equation to solve for \u25c6. However, we only have four equations, and we've already used all four. So, perhaps we don't need to find the numerical value of \u25c6 to compute \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6.\n\nWait, let's see. The question is asking for \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6, which is 2\u25c6 \u00d7 \u25c6, which is 2\u25c6\u00b2. But we need to express this in terms of the given symbols. So, maybe we can write it as 2\u25c6 \u00d7 \u25c6, but that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, since we have other symbols, maybe we can express \u25c6 in terms of \u25b2 or \u2666. Let's see.\n\nFrom equation 3, we have \u2666 = 2\u25c6. So, if we can express \u25c6 in terms of \u2666, that might help.\n\nFrom \u2666 = 2\u25c6, we can rearrange to get \u25c6 = \u2666 / 2.\n\nSimilarly, from equation 1, \u25b2 = 3\u25c6, so \u25c6 = \u25b2 / 3.\n\nSo, we have two expressions for \u25c6:\n\n- \u25c6 = \u2666 / 2\n- \u25c6 = \u25b2 / 3\n\nSince both are equal to \u25c6, we can set them equal to each other:\n\n- \u2666 / 2 = \u25b2 / 3\n\nCross-multiplying gives:\n\n- 3\u2666 = 2\u25b2\n\nSo, 3\u2666 = 2\u25b2. That's another relationship between \u25b2 and \u2666.\n\nBut do we have enough information to find the actual numerical values? Let's see.\n\nWe have:\n\n1. \u2b50 = 2\u25c6\n2. \u25b2 = 3\u25c6\n3. \u2666 = 2\u25c6\n4. 3\u2666 = 2\u25b2\n\nFrom equation 4: 3\u2666 = 2\u25b2, and from equation 3: \u2666 = 2\u25c6, so substituting into equation 4:\n\n- 3(2\u25c6) = 2\u25b2 \u21d2 6\u25c6 = 2\u25b2 \u21d2 \u25b2 = 3\u25c6\n\nWait, that's consistent with equation 2, which says \u25b2 = 3\u25c6. So, it's not giving us new information. Hmm.\n\nSo, perhaps we can't find the exact numerical value of \u25c6 because we don't have enough independent equations. Therefore, we might have to express the answer in terms of \u25c6.\n\nBut let's double-check. Let's see if we can express everything in terms of one symbol.\n\nWe have:\n\n- \u2b50 = 2\u25c6\n- \u25b2 = 3\u25c6\n- \u2666 = 2\u25c6\n\nSo, all symbols are expressed in terms of \u25c6. Therefore, when we compute \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6, it's 2\u25c6 \u00d7 \u25c6, which is 2\u25c6\u00b2. But we need to express this in terms of the given symbols, not necessarily in terms of \u25c6.\n\nWait, maybe we can express \u25c6 in terms of another symbol. Let's see.\n\nFrom equation 3: \u2666 = 2\u25c6 \u21d2 \u25c6 = \u2666 / 2\n\nSo, substituting into \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6:\n\n- \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = 2\u25c6 \u00d7 \u25c6 = 2\u25c6 \u00d7 (\u2666 / 2) = (2\u25c6 \u00d7 \u2666) / 2 = \u25c6 \u00d7 \u2666\n\nBut that doesn't seem helpful because we still have \u25c6 and \u2666 in the expression.\n\nAlternatively, since we have \u25b2 = 3\u25c6, we can write \u25c6 = \u25b2 / 3\n\nSo, substituting into \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6:\n\n- \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = 2\u25c6 \u00d7 \u25c6 = 2\u25c6 \u00d7 (\u25b2 / 3) = (2\u25c6 \u00d7 \u25b2) / 3\n\nAgain, we still have \u25c6 and \u25b2 in the expression.\n\nHmm, maybe we need to find a relationship between the symbols to eliminate \u25c6. Let's see.\n\nFrom equation 4: 3\u2666 = 2\u25b2 \u21d2 3\u2666 = 2\u25b2\n\nWe also have from equation 3: \u2666 = 2\u25c6\n\nSo, substituting into equation 4:\n\n- 3(2\u25c6) = 2\u25b2 \u21d2 6\u25c6 = 2\u25b2 \u21d2 \u25b2 = 3\u25c6\n\nWhich is consistent with equation 2. So, it's not giving us new information.\n\nTherefore, it seems that we can't determine the exact numerical value of \u25c6 because we have dependent equations. So, we have to express the answer in terms of \u25c6.\n\nWait, but the question says \"Express your answer in terms of the given symbols.\" So, maybe we can express it as 2\u25c6 \u00d7 \u25c6, but that's redundant because it's just 2\u25c6\u00b2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can express it in terms of other symbols. Let's see.\n\nFrom equation 3: \u2666 = 2\u25c6 \u21d2 \u25c6 = \u2666 / 2\n\nSo, substituting into \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6:\n\n- \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = 2\u25c6 \u00d7 \u25c6 = 2\u25c6 \u00d7 (\u2666 / 2) = (2\u25c6 \u00d7 \u2666) / 2 = \u25c6 \u00d7 \u2666\n\nBut that's the same as before. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, from equation 1: \u25b2 = 3\u25c6 \u21d2 \u25c6 = \u25b2 / 3\n\nSo, substituting into \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6:\n\n- \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = 2\u25c6 \u00d7 \u25c6 = 2\u25c6 \u00d7 (\u25b2 / 3) = (2\u25c6 \u00d7 \u25b2) / 3\n\nStill, we have both \u25c6 and \u25b2.\n\nWait, maybe we can express \u25c6 in terms of both \u2666 and \u25b2, and then find a relationship.\n\nFrom \u2666 = 2\u25c6 and \u25b2 = 3\u25c6, we have:\n\n- From \u2666 = 2\u25c6 \u21d2 \u25c6 = \u2666 / 2\n- From \u25b2 = 3\u25c6 \u21d2 \u25c6 = \u25b2 / 3\n\nSo, setting them equal:\n\n- \u2666 / 2 = \u25b2 / 3 \u21d2 3\u2666 = 2\u25b2\n\nWhich is equation 4. So, again, it's consistent but not giving us new info.\n\nTherefore, it seems that we can't eliminate \u25c6 from the equation. So, the answer has to be expressed in terms of \u25c6, which is 2\u25c6 \u00d7 \u25c6 = 2\u25c6\u00b2.\n\nBut the question says \"Express your answer in terms of the given symbols.\" So, perhaps that's acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can write it as 2\u25c6 \u00d7 \u25c6, but that's redundant.\n\nWait, but maybe we can express it in terms of other symbols. Let's see.\n\nFrom equation 1: \u25b2 = 3\u25c6 \u21d2 \u25c6 = \u25b2 / 3\n\nFrom equation 3: \u2666 = 2\u25c6 \u21d2 \u2666 = 2(\u25b2 / 3) = (2/3)\u25b2\n\nSo, \u2666 = (2/3)\u25b2\n\nFrom equation 4: 3\u2666 = 2\u25b2 \u21d2 3*(2/3)\u25b2 = 2\u25b2 \u21d2 2\u25b2 = 2\u25b2, which is consistent.\n\nSo, again, we can't get rid of \u25c6.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 2\u25c6 \u00d7 \u25c6, which is 2\u25c6\u00b2. But since the question says to express it in terms of the given symbols, perhaps we can leave it as that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can write it as 2\u25c6 \u00d7 \u25c6 = 2\u25c6\u00b2, but that's not using other symbols.\n\nWait, maybe we can express \u25c6 in terms of another symbol. Let's see.\n\nFrom equation 2: \u2b50 = 2\u25c6 \u21d2 \u25c6 = \u2b50 / 2\n\nSo, substituting into \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6:\n\n- \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = \u2b50 \u00d7 (\u2b50 / 2) = (\u2b50\u00b2) / 2\n\nSo, that's another way to express it in terms of \u2b50. So, \u2b50\u00b2 / 2.\n\nBut is that acceptable? The question says \"in terms of the given symbols,\" which includes \u2b50, \u25c6, \u25b2, and \u2666. So, expressing it in terms of \u2b50 is fine.\n\nAlternatively, we can write it as (\u2b50\u00b2)/2.\n\nBut let me check if that makes sense. Since \u2b50 = 2\u25c6, then \u2b50\u00b2 / 2 = (2\u25c6)\u00b2 / 2 = 4\u25c6\u00b2 / 2 = 2\u25c6\u00b2, which matches our earlier result.\n\nSo, both expressions are equivalent. So, we can write it as either 2\u25c6\u00b2 or (\u2b50\u00b2)/2.\n\nI think the latter is better because it uses the given symbols, specifically \u2b50, and doesn't introduce a new symbol like \u25c6\u00b2 or something.\n\nSo, perhaps the answer is (\u2b50\u00b2)/2.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The question is asking for \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6, and we've expressed it as 2\u25c6\u00b2 or (\u2b50\u00b2)/2. Both are correct, but since the question says \"in terms of the given symbols,\" using \u2b50 is better.\n\nSo, (\u2b50\u00b2)/2 is the answer.\n\nBut let me make sure. Let's see:\n\n- From equation 2: \u2b50 = 2\u25c6 \u21d2 \u25c6 = \u2b50 / 2\n- Therefore, \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = \u2b50 \u00d7 (\u2b50 / 2) = \u2b50\u00b2 / 2\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, we can also express it as 2\u25c6\u00b2, but using \u2b50 is more direct since it's a given symbol.\n\nSo, the final answer is (\u2b50\u00b2)/2.\n\nBut wait, let me check if that's the simplest form.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can write it as (\u2b50 \u00d7 \u2b50)/2, but that's the same as (\u2b50\u00b2)/2.\n\nSo, I think (\u2b50\u00b2)/2 is the best way to express it in terms of the given symbols.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (\u2b50\u00b2)/2.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the system of equations, we start by expressing each symbol in terms of \u25c6:\n\n1. From \u25c6 + \u25c6 = \u2b50, we get \u2b50 = 2\u25c6.\n2. From \u2b50 + \u25c6 = \u25b2, substituting \u2b50 gives 3\u25c6 = \u25b2.\n3. From \u25b2 - \u25c6 = \u2666, substituting \u25b2 gives 2\u25c6 = \u2666.\n4. Finally, \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = 2\u25c6 \u00d7 \u25c6 = 2\u25c6\u00b2. Expressing this in terms of \u2b50, since \u2b50 = 2\u25c6, we get (\u2b50\u00b2)/2.\n\nAnswer: \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = (\u2b50\u00b2)/2\n\nDONE."

End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: In a symbolic substitution system, the following equations are true:\n\n\u2b50 + \u25c6 = \u25b2\n\u25c6 + \u25c6 = \u2b50\n\u25b2 - \u25c6 = \u2666\n\u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = ?\n\nIf each symbol represents a consistent value throughout the system, what does \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 equal? Express your answer in terms of the given symbols. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I've got this symbolic substitution system with four symbols: \u2b50, \u25c6, \u25b2, and \u2666. The equations given are:\n\n1. \u2b50 + \u25c6 = \u25b2\n2. \u25c6 + \u25c6 = \u2b50\n3. \u25b2 - \u25c6 = \u2666\n\nAnd I need to find what \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 equals. Okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's list out the equations again for clarity:\n\n1. \u2b50 + \u25c6 = \u25b2\n2. \u25c6 + \u25c6 = \u2b50\n3. \u25b2 - \u25c6 = \u2666\n\nSo, we have three equations with four variables. That might seem tricky because usually, you need as many equations as variables to solve them uniquely. But maybe these symbols represent numbers or something that can be related through substitution.\n\nLooking at equation 2: \u25c6 + \u25c6 = \u2b50. That simplifies to 2 \u00d7 \u25c6 = \u2b50. So, \u2b50 is twice the value of \u25c6. That's helpful because now I can express \u2b50 in terms of \u25c6.\n\nSo, from equation 2:\n\u2b50 = 2 \u00d7 \u25c6\n\nNow, let's plug this into equation 1: \u2b50 + \u25c6 = \u25b2. Substituting \u2b50 with 2 \u00d7 \u25c6, we get:\n2 \u00d7 \u25c6 + \u25c6 = \u25b2\n\nSimplifying that:\n3 \u00d7 \u25c6 = \u25b2\n\nSo now, \u25b2 is three times \u25c6. That's good to know.\n\nNow, equation 3 says \u25b2 - \u25c6 = \u2666. Since we know \u25b2 is 3 \u00d7 \u25c6, substituting that in:\n3 \u00d7 \u25c6 - \u25c6 = \u2666\n\nSimplify:\n2 \u00d7 \u25c6 = \u2666\n\nSo, \u2666 is twice \u25c6. Interesting, so \u2666 is also related to \u25c6.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n- \u2b50 = 2 \u00d7 \u25c6\n- \u25b2 = 3 \u00d7 \u25c6\n- \u2666 = 2 \u00d7 \u25c6\n\nWait a minute, both \u2b50 and \u2666 are twice \u25c6. So, does that mean \u2b50 equals \u2666? Let's check:\n\nFrom above:\n\u2b50 = 2 \u00d7 \u25c6\n\u2666 = 2 \u00d7 \u25c6\n\nYes, that means \u2b50 and \u2666 are equal. So, \u2b50 = \u2666.\n\nBut let's make sure that's consistent with all equations.\n\nFrom equation 1: \u2b50 + \u25c6 = \u25b2\nWe know \u2b50 = 2 \u00d7 \u25c6 and \u25b2 = 3 \u00d7 \u25c6, so:\n2 \u00d7 \u25c6 + \u25c6 = 3 \u00d7 \u25c6\nWhich is 3 \u00d7 \u25c6 = 3 \u00d7 \u25c6. That checks out.\n\nEquation 2: \u25c6 + \u25c6 = \u2b50\nWhich is 2 \u00d7 \u25c6 = 2 \u00d7 \u25c6. That also checks out.\n\nEquation 3: \u25b2 - \u25c6 = \u2666\nWhich is 3 \u00d7 \u25c6 - \u25c6 = 2 \u00d7 \u25c6. That's 2 \u00d7 \u25c6 = 2 \u00d7 \u25c6. Yep, that works too.\n\nSo, all equations are consistent with these relationships.\n\nNow, the question is asking for \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6. Let's compute that.\n\nWe know that \u2b50 = 2 \u00d7 \u25c6, so:\n\n\u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = (2 \u00d7 \u25c6) \u00d7 \u25c6\n\nMultiplying those together:\n= 2 \u00d7 \u25c6 \u00d7 \u25c6\n= 2 \u00d7 (\u25c6 \u00d7 \u25c6)\n= 2 \u00d7 \u25c6\u00b2\n\nSo, \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 equals 2 \u00d7 (\u25c6 squared). But the problem says to express the answer in terms of the given symbols. Since we don't have a symbol for \u25c6 squared, I guess we can leave it as 2 \u00d7 \u25c6\u00b2 or perhaps find a way to express it using the other symbols.\n\nWait, but from earlier, we have \u2b50 = 2 \u00d7 \u25c6 and \u25b2 = 3 \u00d7 \u25c6. Maybe we can express \u25c6 in terms of \u2b50 or \u25b2.\n\nFrom \u2b50 = 2 \u00d7 \u25c6, we can solve for \u25c6:\n\u25c6 = \u2b50 / 2\n\nSimilarly, from \u25b2 = 3 \u00d7 \u25c6, we can also express \u25c6 as:\n\u25c6 = \u25b2 / 3\n\nSince both expressions equal \u25c6, we can set them equal to each other:\n\u2b50 / 2 = \u25b2 / 3\n\nCross-multiplying:\n3 \u00d7 \u2b50 = 2 \u00d7 \u25b2\n\nSo, 3 \u00d7 \u2b50 = 2 \u00d7 \u25b2\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps directly, but let's see.\n\nWe need to find \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6. We have:\n\u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = 2 \u00d7 \u25c6\u00b2\n\nBut perhaps we can express \u25c6\u00b2 in terms of other symbols. Let's think.\n\nFrom \u25c6 = \u2b50 / 2, then:\n\u25c6\u00b2 = (\u2b50 / 2)\u00b2 = \u2b50\u00b2 / 4\n\nSo, substituting back:\n\u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = 2 \u00d7 (\u2b50\u00b2 / 4) = (2 \u00d7 \u2b50\u00b2) / 4 = \u2b50\u00b2 / 2\n\nAlternatively, since we also have \u25b2 = 3 \u00d7 \u25c6, then:\n\u25c6 = \u25b2 / 3\nSo, \u25c6\u00b2 = (\u25b2 / 3)\u00b2 = \u25b2\u00b2 / 9\n\nThen, \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = 2 \u00d7 (\u25b2\u00b2 / 9) = (2 \u00d7 \u25b2\u00b2) / 9\n\nBut I don't know if that's helpful because we don't have a symbol for \u25b2 squared.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can express everything in terms of \u2b50.\n\nFrom \u2b50 = 2 \u00d7 \u25c6, so \u25c6 = \u2b50 / 2\n\nThus, \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = \u2b50 \u00d7 (\u2b50 / 2) = \u2b50\u00b2 / 2\n\nSo, \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 equals half of \u2b50 squared. But the problem asks to express the answer in terms of the given symbols. Since we don't have a symbol for squaring, maybe we can leave it as 2 \u00d7 \u25c6\u00b2 or perhaps find another way.\n\nWait, let's go back to the equations. We have:\n\n- \u2b50 = 2 \u00d7 \u25c6\n- \u25b2 = 3 \u00d7 \u25c6\n- \u2666 = 2 \u00d7 \u25c6\n\nSo, all of \u2b50, \u25b2, and \u2666 are multiples of \u25c6. Maybe we can find a relationship between them without squares.\n\nBut the question is about multiplication, not addition or subtraction. So, perhaps the answer is just 2 \u00d7 \u25c6\u00b2.\n\nBut let's see if we can express it differently. Since \u2b50 = 2 \u00d7 \u25c6, then:\n\n\u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = (2 \u00d7 \u25c6) \u00d7 \u25c6 = 2 \u00d7 \u25c6\u00b2\n\nAlternatively, since \u25b2 = 3 \u00d7 \u25c6, then:\n\n\u25c6 = \u25b2 / 3\n\nSo, substituting into 2 \u00d7 \u25c6\u00b2:\n\n2 \u00d7 (\u25b2 / 3)\u00b2 = 2 \u00d7 (\u25b2\u00b2 / 9) = (2/9) \u00d7 \u25b2\u00b2\n\nBut again, we don't have a symbol for \u25b2 squared.\n\nAlternatively, since \u2b50 = 2 \u00d7 \u25c6 and \u25b2 = 3 \u00d7 \u25c6, maybe we can relate \u2b50 and \u25b2.\n\nFrom \u2b50 = 2 \u00d7 \u25c6 and \u25b2 = 3 \u00d7 \u25c6, we can write:\n\n\u25c6 = \u2b50 / 2\n\u25c6 = \u25b2 / 3\n\nSo, setting them equal:\n\u2b50 / 2 = \u25b2 / 3\nCross-multiplying:\n3 \u00d7 \u2b50 = 2 \u00d7 \u25b2\n\nSo, 3 \u00d7 \u2b50 = 2 \u00d7 \u25b2\n\nBut I don't see how that helps directly with finding \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6.\n\nWait, let's think differently. Maybe we can find the value of each symbol in terms of a variable and then compute the product.\n\nLet's assign a variable to \u25c6, say, let x = \u25c6.\n\nThen, from equation 2: \u2b50 = 2x\n\nFrom equation 1: \u25b2 = \u2b50 + \u25c6 = 2x + x = 3x\n\nFrom equation 3: \u2666 = \u25b2 - \u25c6 = 3x - x = 2x\n\nSo, we have:\n\n- \u25c6 = x\n- \u2b50 = 2x\n- \u25b2 = 3x\n- \u2666 = 2x\n\nSo, all symbols are expressed in terms of x. Now, the question is \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6.\n\nSo, \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = 2x \u00d7 x = 2x\u00b2\n\nBut the problem asks to express the answer in terms of the given symbols. Since x is just a variable, and we don't have a symbol for x\u00b2, perhaps we can express it using the symbols we have.\n\nFrom the above, we have:\n\n- \u2b50 = 2x\n- \u25b2 = 3x\n\nSo, x = \u2b50 / 2\n\nThus, x\u00b2 = (\u2b50 / 2)\u00b2 = \u2b50\u00b2 / 4\n\nTherefore, 2x\u00b2 = 2 \u00d7 (\u2b50\u00b2 / 4) = \u2b50\u00b2 / 2\n\nSo, \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = \u2b50\u00b2 / 2\n\nAlternatively, since \u25b2 = 3x, then x = \u25b2 / 3\n\nSo, x\u00b2 = (\u25b2 / 3)\u00b2 = \u25b2\u00b2 / 9\n\nThus, 2x\u00b2 = 2 \u00d7 (\u25b2\u00b2 / 9) = (2/9) \u00d7 \u25b2\u00b2\n\nBut again, we don't have a symbol for \u25b2 squared.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can relate \u2b50 and \u25b2.\n\nFrom earlier, 3 \u00d7 \u2b50 = 2 \u00d7 \u25b2\n\nSo, \u25b2 = (3/2) \u00d7 \u2b50\n\nThus, substituting into 2x\u00b2:\n\n2x\u00b2 = (2/9) \u00d7 \u25b2\u00b2 = (2/9) \u00d7 ( (3/2 \u00d7 \u2b50) )\u00b2\n\nCalculating that:\n\n(3/2 \u00d7 \u2b50)\u00b2 = (9/4) \u00d7 \u2b50\u00b2\n\nSo, 2x\u00b2 = (2/9) \u00d7 (9/4) \u00d7 \u2b50\u00b2 = (2/9) \u00d7 (9/4) \u00d7 \u2b50\u00b2 = (2/4) \u00d7 \u2b50\u00b2 = (1/2) \u00d7 \u2b50\u00b2\n\nWhich confirms that 2x\u00b2 = \u2b50\u00b2 / 2\n\nSo, \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = \u2b50\u00b2 / 2\n\nBut since the problem asks to express the answer in terms of the given symbols, and we don't have a symbol for squaring, perhaps the simplest way is to express it as 2 \u00d7 \u25c6\u00b2, since we know that \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = 2 \u00d7 \u25c6\u00b2 from earlier.\n\nAlternatively, since we have \u2b50 = 2 \u00d7 \u25c6, we can write:\n\n\u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = (2 \u00d7 \u25c6) \u00d7 \u25c6 = 2 \u00d7 \u25c6\u00b2\n\nSo, that's straightforward.\n\nBut let's see if we can write it using other symbols. Since we have \u25b2 = 3 \u00d7 \u25c6, then:\n\n\u25c6 = \u25b2 / 3\n\nSo, \u25c6\u00b2 = (\u25b2 / 3)\u00b2 = \u25b2\u00b2 / 9\n\nThus, 2 \u00d7 \u25c6\u00b2 = 2 \u00d7 (\u25b2\u00b2 / 9) = (2/9) \u00d7 \u25b2\u00b2\n\nBut again, we don't have a symbol for \u25b2 squared.\n\nAlternatively, from \u2b50 = 2 \u00d7 \u25c6, we can express \u25c6 as \u2b50 / 2\n\nSo, 2 \u00d7 \u25c6\u00b2 = 2 \u00d7 (\u2b50 / 2)\u00b2 = 2 \u00d7 (\u2b50\u00b2 / 4) = \u2b50\u00b2 / 2\n\nSo, that's the same as before.\n\nBut perhaps the answer is simply 2 \u00d7 \u25c6\u00b2, since that's directly from the multiplication.\n\nAlternatively, if we can express \u25c6\u00b2 in terms of other symbols, but I think it's not necessary. The problem just wants the expression in terms of the given symbols, so 2 \u00d7 \u25c6\u00b2 is acceptable.\n\nWait, but let me double-check.\n\nFrom the equations:\n\n- \u2b50 = 2 \u00d7 \u25c6\n- \u25b2 = 3 \u00d7 \u25c6\n- \u2666 = 2 \u00d7 \u25c6\n\nSo, all symbols are multiples of \u25c6. Therefore, perhaps we can express everything in terms of \u25c6.\n\nThus, \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = 2 \u00d7 \u25c6 \u00d7 \u25c6 = 2 \u00d7 \u25c6\u00b2\n\nYes, that's straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, since we have \u2b50 = 2 \u00d7 \u25c6, we can write:\n\n\u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = (2 \u00d7 \u25c6) \u00d7 \u25c6 = 2 \u00d7 \u25c6\u00b2\n\nSo, that's the answer.\n\nAlternatively, if we want to express it in terms of other symbols, like \u25b2, since \u25b2 = 3 \u00d7 \u25c6, then:\n\n\u25c6 = \u25b2 / 3\n\nSo, \u25c6\u00b2 = (\u25b2 / 3)\u00b2 = \u25b2\u00b2 / 9\n\nThus, \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = 2 \u00d7 (\u25b2\u00b2 / 9) = (2/9) \u00d7 \u25b2\u00b2\n\nBut I don't know if that's necessary because the problem doesn't specify to use other symbols, just to express the answer in terms of the given symbols. So, 2 \u00d7 \u25c6\u00b2 is fine.\n\nAlternatively, since we have \u2b50 = 2 \u00d7 \u25c6, and we can express \u25c6 in terms of \u2b50, which is \u25c6 = \u2b50 / 2, then:\n\n\u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = \u2b50 \u00d7 (\u2b50 / 2) = \u2b50\u00b2 / 2\n\nSo, that's another way to express it.\n\nBut again, the problem says to express in terms of the given symbols, so using symbols like \u2b50 and \u25c6 is acceptable.\n\nHowever, since we have the relationships, perhaps the answer is simply 2 \u00d7 \u25c6\u00b2 or \u2b50\u00b2 / 2.\n\nBut let me think if there's another way. Maybe using the fact that \u2b50 = 2 \u00d7 \u25c6 and \u25b2 = 3 \u00d7 \u25c6, so we can relate \u2b50 and \u25b2.\n\nFrom earlier, we have 3 \u00d7 \u2b50 = 2 \u00d7 \u25b2\n\nSo, 3 \u00d7 \u2b50 = 2 \u00d7 \u25b2\n\nBut I don't see how that helps directly with finding \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can find the value of each symbol numerically.\n\nSuppose we let \u25c6 = 1.\n\nThen:\n\n- \u2b50 = 2 \u00d7 1 = 2\n- \u25b2 = 3 \u00d7 1 = 3\n- \u2666 = 2 \u00d7 1 = 2\n\nSo, then:\n\n\u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = 2 \u00d7 1 = 2\n\nBut in terms of symbols, that's 2 \u00d7 \u25c6\u00b2, which equals 2 when \u25c6=1.\n\nBut since the problem doesn't specify numerical values, we have to keep it symbolic.\n\nSo, in conclusion, \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 equals 2 \u00d7 \u25c6 squared, or in terms of other symbols, if possible, but it's simplest to express it as 2 \u00d7 \u25c6\u00b2.\n\nAlternatively, since \u2b50 = 2 \u00d7 \u25c6, we can write \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = (2 \u00d7 \u25c6) \u00d7 \u25c6 = 2 \u00d7 \u25c6\u00b2\n\nSo, that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe value of \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 is calculated by substituting the known relationships. Since \u2b50 equals 2 \u00d7 \u25c6, multiplying them gives 2 \u00d7 \u25c6\u00b2.\n\n**Answer:** \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = 2 \u00d7 \u25c6\u00b2\n\nDONE."

End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: In a symbolic substitution system, the following equations are true:\n\n\u2b50 + \u25c6 = \u25b2\n\u25c6 + \u25c6 = \u2b50\n\u25b2 - \u25c6 = \u2666\n\u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = ?\n\nIf each symbol represents a consistent value throughout the system, what does \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 equal? Express your answer in terms of the given symbols. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I've got this symbolic substitution system problem here, and I need to figure out what \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 equals. The problem gives me a few equations:\n\n1. \u2b50 + \u25c6 = \u25b2\n2. \u25c6 + \u25c6 = \u2b50\n3. \u25b2 - \u25c6 = \u2666\n\nAnd I need to find \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's list out the equations again to make sure I have them straight:\n\n1. \u2b50 + \u25c6 = \u25b2\n2. \u25c6 + \u25c6 = \u2b50\n3. \u25b2 - \u25c6 = \u2666\n\nSo, I have three equations here with three variables: \u2b50, \u25c6, and \u25b2. That should be solvable since I have as many equations as variables.\n\nStarting with equation 2: \u25c6 + \u25c6 = \u2b50. That simplifies to 2\u25c6 = \u2b50. So, \u2b50 is twice \u25c6. That's helpful because I can express \u2b50 in terms of \u25c6.\n\nSo, from equation 2, \u2b50 = 2\u25c6.\n\nNow, let's plug that into equation 1: \u2b50 + \u25c6 = \u25b2. If \u2b50 is 2\u25c6, then:\n\n2\u25c6 + \u25c6 = \u25b2  \nWhich simplifies to 3\u25c6 = \u25b2. So, \u25b2 is three times \u25c6.\n\nNow, equation 3 is \u25b2 - \u25c6 = \u2666. We've just found that \u25b2 is 3\u25c6, so substituting that in:\n\n3\u25c6 - \u25c6 = \u2666  \nWhich simplifies to 2\u25c6 = \u2666. So, \u2666 is twice \u25c6.\n\nSo far, we have:\n\n- \u2b50 = 2\u25c6\n- \u25b2 = 3\u25c6\n- \u2666 = 2\u25c6\n\nNow, the question is asking for \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6. Since we know \u2b50 is 2\u25c6, we can substitute that in:\n\n\u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = (2\u25c6) \u00d7 \u25c6  \nWhich is 2\u25c6 \u00d7 \u25c6. Multiplying those together gives 2\u25c6\u00b2.\n\nWait a second, but the question wants the answer expressed in terms of the given symbols, not in terms of \u25c6. So, I need to express 2\u25c6\u00b2 in terms of the other symbols: \u2b50, \u25b2, or \u2666.\n\nLooking back at what we have:\n\n- \u2b50 = 2\u25c6\n- \u25b2 = 3\u25c6\n- \u2666 = 2\u25c6\n\nSo, let's see if we can express \u25c6 in terms of \u2b50 or \u25b2.\n\nFrom \u2b50 = 2\u25c6, we can solve for \u25c6: \u25c6 = \u2b50 / 2.\n\nSimilarly, from \u25b2 = 3\u25c6, solving for \u25c6 gives \u25c6 = \u25b2 / 3.\n\nAnd from \u2666 = 2\u25c6, solving for \u25c6 gives \u25c6 = \u2666 / 2.\n\nSo, now we have:\n\n- \u25c6 = \u2b50 / 2\n- \u25c6 = \u25b2 / 3\n- \u25c6 = \u2666 / 2\n\nSince all three expressions equal \u25c6, they must equal each other. Therefore:\n\n\u2b50 / 2 = \u25b2 / 3  \nAnd  \n\u25b2 / 3 = \u2666 / 2\n\nSo, let's check the first one: \u2b50 / 2 = \u25b2 / 3  \nCross-multiplying gives 3\u2b50 = 2\u25b2.\n\nSimilarly, from \u25b2 / 3 = \u2666 / 2  \nCross-multiplying gives 2\u25b2 = 3\u2666.\n\nSo, 3\u2b50 = 2\u25b2 and 2\u25b2 = 3\u2666.\n\nThis implies that 3\u2b50 = 3\u2666, so \u2b50 = \u2666.\n\nThat's interesting. So, \u2b50 equals \u2666.\n\nWait, let me make sure that makes sense. If \u2b50 = \u2666, then from \u2b50 = 2\u25c6, we have \u2666 = 2\u25c6 as well.\n\nAnd from \u25b2 = 3\u25c6, and since \u2666 = 2\u25c6, then \u25b2 = 3*(\u2666 / 2) = (3/2)\u2666.\n\nBut let's see if that holds with the earlier equations.\n\nFrom equation 3: \u25b2 - \u25c6 = \u2666  \nSubstituting \u25b2 = (3/2)\u2666 and \u25c6 = (1/2)\u2666:\n\n(3/2)\u2666 - (1/2)\u2666 = \u2666  \nWhich simplifies to (2/2)\u2666 = \u2666, so \u2666 = \u2666. That checks out.\n\nNow, going back to \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6, which we found to be 2\u25c6\u00b2. Let's see if we can express \u25c6\u00b2 in terms of the other symbols.\n\nSince we have multiple expressions for \u25c6:\n\n\u25c6 = \u2b50 / 2, so \u25c6\u00b2 = (\u2b50 / 2)\u00b2 = \u2b50\u00b2 / 4.\n\nAlternatively, \u25c6 = \u25b2 / 3, so \u25c6\u00b2 = (\u25b2 / 3)\u00b2 = \u25b2\u00b2 / 9.\n\nAnd \u25c6 = \u2666 / 2, so \u25c6\u00b2 = (\u2666 / 2)\u00b2 = \u2666\u00b2 / 4.\n\nSo, 2\u25c6\u00b2 = 2*(\u2b50\u00b2 / 4) = \u2b50\u00b2 / 2.\n\nAlternatively, 2\u25c6\u00b2 = 2*(\u25b2\u00b2 / 9) = (2/9)\u25b2\u00b2.\n\nAnd 2\u25c6\u00b2 = 2*(\u2666\u00b2 / 4) = \u2666\u00b2 / 2.\n\nHmm, but we need to express 2\u25c6\u00b2 in terms of one symbol, not a combination. Let's see if we can find a relationship between the symbols.\n\nEarlier, we found that 3\u2b50 = 2\u25b2, which means \u25b2 = (3/2)\u2b50.\n\nSimilarly, 2\u25b2 = 3\u2666, so \u2666 = (2/3)\u25b2.\n\nBut since \u25b2 = (3/2)\u2b50, substituting into \u2666 = (2/3)\u25b2 gives:\n\n\u2666 = (2/3)*(3/2)\u2b50 = (2/3)*(3/2)\u2b50 = 1\u2b50 = \u2b50.\n\nSo, as before, \u2b50 = \u2666.\n\nTherefore, we can express 2\u25c6\u00b2 in terms of \u2b50.\n\nSince 2\u25c6\u00b2 = \u2b50\u00b2 / 2.\n\nAlternatively, since \u2b50 = 2\u25c6, 2\u25c6\u00b2 = (2\u25c6)\u00b2 / 2 = 4\u25c6\u00b2 / 2 = 2\u25c6\u00b2, which doesn't help much.\n\nWait, maybe another approach. Let's see:\n\nFrom equation 1: \u2b50 + \u25c6 = \u25b2  \nWe have \u2b50 = 2\u25c6, so \u25b2 = 3\u25c6.\n\nFrom equation 3: \u25b2 - \u25c6 = \u2666  \nSo, 3\u25c6 - \u25c6 = 2\u25c6 = \u2666.\n\nThus, \u2666 = 2\u25c6.\n\nBut we also have \u2b50 = 2\u25c6, so \u2b50 = \u2666.\n\nSo, \u2b50 = \u2666.\n\nTherefore, \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6.\n\nBut we know that \u2b50 = 2\u25c6, so substituting:\n\n\u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = 2\u25c6 \u00d7 \u25c6 = 2\u25c6\u00b2.\n\nBut we need to express this in terms of symbols we have, not in terms of \u25c6.\n\nSince we have \u2b50 = \u2666, and we need to express 2\u25c6\u00b2 in terms of \u2b50 or \u25b2 or \u2666.\n\nFrom earlier, we have:\n\n2\u25c6\u00b2 = (2\u25c6)\u00b2 / 2 = \u2b50\u00b2 / 2.\n\nWait, that's not correct.\n\nWait, no: 2\u25c6\u00b2 is 2 times \u25c6 squared.\n\nBut since \u2b50 = 2\u25c6, then \u25c6 = \u2b50 / 2.\n\nSo, 2\u25c6\u00b2 = 2*(\u2b50 / 2)\u00b2 = 2*(\u2b50\u00b2 / 4) = \u2b50\u00b2 / 2.\n\nSo, 2\u25c6\u00b2 = (1/2)\u2b50\u00b2.\n\nAlternatively, since \u2b50 = \u2666, then 2\u25c6\u00b2 = (1/2)\u2666\u00b2.\n\nBut the problem is asking for \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6, which is 2\u25c6\u00b2, and we've expressed that as (1/2)\u2b50\u00b2 or (1/2)\u2666\u00b2.\n\nBut maybe we can find a better expression.\n\nWait, let's think differently.\n\nFrom equation 1: \u2b50 + \u25c6 = \u25b2  \nAnd we have \u2b50 = 2\u25c6, so \u25b2 = 3\u25c6.\n\nFrom equation 3: \u25b2 - \u25c6 = \u2666  \nSo, 3\u25c6 - \u25c6 = 2\u25c6 = \u2666.\n\nThus, \u2666 = 2\u25c6.\n\nSince \u2b50 = 2\u25c6, then \u2b50 = \u2666.\n\nSo, \u2b50 = \u2666.\n\nNow, let's express everything in terms of \u2b50.\n\nWe have:\n\n- \u2b50 = 2\u25c6\n- \u25b2 = 3\u25c6\n- \u2666 = 2\u25c6 = \u2b50\n\nSo, \u25b2 = 3\u25c6 = (3/2)\u2b50.\n\nTherefore, \u25b2 = (3/2)\u2b50.\n\nNow, let's see if we can find a relationship between \u2b50 and \u25b2.\n\nFrom equation 1: \u2b50 + \u25c6 = \u25b2  \nSubstituting \u25c6 = \u2b50 / 2 and \u25b2 = (3/2)\u2b50:\n\n\u2b50 + (\u2b50 / 2) = (3/2)\u2b50  \nWhich simplifies to (3/2)\u2b50 = (3/2)\u2b50. That checks out.\n\nNow, going back to \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6.\n\nWe have \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = 2\u25c6\u00b2.\n\nBut let's express \u25c6 in terms of \u2b50: \u25c6 = \u2b50 / 2.\n\nSo, \u25c6\u00b2 = (\u2b50 / 2)\u00b2 = \u2b50\u00b2 / 4.\n\nThus, 2\u25c6\u00b2 = 2*(\u2b50\u00b2 / 4) = \u2b50\u00b2 / 2.\n\nSo, \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = \u2b50\u00b2 / 2.\n\nAlternatively, since \u2b50 = \u2666, then \u2b50\u00b2 / 2 = \u2666\u00b2 / 2.\n\nBut the problem asks for the answer in terms of the given symbols, so we can choose either \u2b50 or \u2666.\n\nBut let's check if we can express it as a combination of other symbols.\n\nWe have \u25b2 = (3/2)\u2b50.\n\nSo, \u2b50 = (2/3)\u25b2.\n\nThus, \u2b50\u00b2 = (4/9)\u25b2\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, \u2b50\u00b2 / 2 = (4/9)\u25b2\u00b2 / 2 = (2/9)\u25b2\u00b2.\n\nSo, \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = (2/9)\u25b2\u00b2.\n\nAlternatively, since \u2666 = \u2b50, then \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = \u2666\u00b2 / 2.\n\nBut I think the simplest expression is \u2b50\u00b2 / 2, since it directly relates \u2b50 to itself.\n\nAlternatively, since we have \u25b2 = (3/2)\u2b50, and \u2b50 = (2/3)\u25b2, so:\n\n\u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = (2/3)\u25b2 \u00d7 (1/2)\u25b2 = (2/3)*(1/2)\u25b2\u00b2 = (1/3)\u25b2\u00b2.\n\nWait, that's a different result. Hmm, that suggests a mistake in my earlier steps.\n\nWait, let's recast this.\n\nWe have:\n\n- \u2b50 = 2\u25c6\n- \u25b2 = 3\u25c6\n- \u2666 = 2\u25c6 = \u2b50\n\nSo, in terms of \u25b2:\n\n- \u25c6 = \u25b2 / 3\n- \u2b50 = 2\u25c6 = 2*(\u25b2 / 3) = (2/3)\u25b2\n- \u2666 = \u2b50 = (2/3)\u25b2\n\nSo, now, let's compute \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6:\n\n\u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = (2/3)\u25b2 \u00d7 (\u25b2 / 3) = (2/3)*(1/3)\u25b2\u00b2 = (2/9)\u25b2\u00b2.\n\nSo, that's consistent with earlier.\n\nAlternatively, in terms of \u2666:\n\nSince \u2b50 = \u2666, and \u25c6 = \u2666 / 2.\n\nThus, \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = \u2666 \u00d7 (\u2666 / 2) = \u2666\u00b2 / 2.\n\nBut we also have from earlier that 2\u25c6\u00b2 = \u2b50\u00b2 / 2.\n\nSince \u2b50 = \u2666, then 2\u25c6\u00b2 = \u2666\u00b2 / 2.\n\nBut we also have 2\u25c6\u00b2 = (2/9)\u25b2\u00b2.\n\nSo, (2/9)\u25b2\u00b2 = \u2666\u00b2 / 2.\n\nThus, all these expressions are consistent.\n\nSo, the question is, which expression is the simplest in terms of the given symbols.\n\nGiven the options, I think expressing it in terms of \u2b50 is acceptable, so \u2b50\u00b2 / 2.\n\nAlternatively, it could be expressed as (2/9)\u25b2\u00b2 or \u2666\u00b2 / 2.\n\nBut perhaps the problem expects the answer in terms of the symbols given, not necessarily combining them.\n\nLooking back at the problem statement: \"Express your answer in terms of the given symbols.\"\n\nSo, the symbols are \u2b50, \u25c6, \u25b2, and \u2666.\n\nThus, we can express \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 as (1/2)\u2b50\u00b2, or as (2/9)\u25b2\u00b2, or as (1/2)\u2666\u00b2.\n\nBut to express it in terms of the given symbols, it's acceptable to have a coefficient in front.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to express it without fractions.\n\nWait, let me think again.\n\nFrom the equations:\n\n- \u2b50 = 2\u25c6\n- \u25b2 = 3\u25c6\n- \u2666 = 2\u25c6 = \u2b50\n\nSo, all in terms of \u25c6.\n\nThus, \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = 2\u25c6 \u00d7 \u25c6 = 2\u25c6\u00b2.\n\nBut we can express \u25c6\u00b2 in terms of \u2b50 or \u25b2.\n\nSince \u25c6 = \u2b50 / 2, then \u25c6\u00b2 = \u2b50\u00b2 / 4.\n\nThus, 2\u25c6\u00b2 = 2*(\u2b50\u00b2 / 4) = \u2b50\u00b2 / 2.\n\nAlternatively, since \u25b2 = 3\u25c6, then \u25c6 = \u25b2 / 3, so \u25c6\u00b2 = \u25b2\u00b2 / 9.\n\nThus, 2\u25c6\u00b2 = 2*(\u25b2\u00b2 / 9) = (2/9)\u25b2\u00b2.\n\nSimilarly, since \u2666 = 2\u25c6, then \u25c6 = \u2666 / 2, so \u25c6\u00b2 = \u2666\u00b2 / 4.\n\nThus, 2\u25c6\u00b2 = 2*(\u2666\u00b2 / 4) = \u2666\u00b2 / 2.\n\nSo, the answer can be expressed in three ways:\n\n- \u2b50\u00b2 / 2\n- (2/9)\u25b2\u00b2\n- \u2666\u00b2 / 2\n\nSince the problem says \"in terms of the given symbols,\" any of these should be acceptable.\n\nBut perhaps the most straightforward is to express it in terms of \u2b50, since we know \u2b50 directly relates to \u25c6.\n\nSo, \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = (1/2)\u2b50\u00b2.\n\nAlternatively, since \u2b50 = \u2666, then it's also \u2666\u00b2 / 2.\n\nBut let's check if we can express it without fractions.\n\nWait, from the equations:\n\nWe have 3\u2b50 = 2\u25b2.\n\nSo, 3\u2b50 = 2\u25b2 \u21d2 3\u2b50 = 2\u25b2 \u21d2 \u25b2 = (3/2)\u2b50.\n\nSimilarly, 2\u25b2 = 3\u2666 \u21d2 2\u25b2 = 3\u2666 \u21d2 \u2666 = (2/3)\u25b2.\n\nBut since \u2b50 = 2\u25c6, and \u25b2 = 3\u25c6, then \u25b2 = 3*(\u2b50 / 2) = (3/2)\u2b50.\n\nSo, \u25b2 = (3/2)\u2b50.\n\nThus, if we have \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6, and we know that \u25c6 = \u2b50 / 2, then:\n\n\u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = \u2b50 \u00d7 (\u2b50 / 2) = (\u2b50\u00b2) / 2.\n\nSo, that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, since \u25b2 = (3/2)\u2b50, then \u2b50 = (2/3)\u25b2.\n\nThus, \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = (2/3)\u25b2 \u00d7 (\u25b2 / 3) = (2/9)\u25b2\u00b2.\n\nBut perhaps the simplest is to express it as (1/2)\u2b50\u00b2.\n\nAlternatively, since we know that \u2b50 = \u2666, then:\n\n\u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = \u2666 \u00d7 (\u2666 / 2) = (\u2666\u00b2) / 2.\n\nSo, that's another way.\n\nBut perhaps the problem expects the answer in terms of one symbol, so either \u2b50\u00b2 / 2, (2/9)\u25b2\u00b2, or \u2666\u00b2 / 2.\n\nGiven that, I think the most straightforward is to express it in terms of \u2b50, so \u2b50\u00b2 / 2.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nFrom the equations:\n\n- \u2b50 = 2\u25c6\n- \u25b2 = 3\u25c6\n- \u2666 = 2\u25c6\n\nSo, \u2b50 = 2\u25c6, meaning that \u25c6 = \u2b50 / 2.\n\nThus, \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = \u2b50 \u00d7 (\u2b50 / 2) = \u2b50\u00b2 / 2.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, since \u2b50 = \u2666, then:\n\n\u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = \u2666 \u00d7 (\u2666 / 2) = \u2666\u00b2 / 2.\n\nBut since the problem allows expressing in terms of any given symbols, either would be acceptable.\n\nHowever, to keep it simple, I think \u2b50\u00b2 / 2 is a good answer.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nFrom the equations, we found that \u2b50 = 2\u25c6 and \u25b2 = 3\u25c6, and \u2666 = 2\u25c6.\n\nThus, \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = 2\u25c6 \u00d7 \u25c6 = 2\u25c6\u00b2.\n\nExpressing \u25c6 in terms of \u2b50: \u25c6 = \u2b50 / 2.\n\nTherefore, 2\u25c6\u00b2 = 2*(\u2b50 / 2)\u00b2 = 2*(\u2b50\u00b2 / 4) = \u2b50\u00b2 / 2.\n\nSo, the final answer is \u2b50\u00b2 / 2.\n</think>\n\nThe answer is found by expressing \u2b50 and \u25c6 in terms of each other and substituting into the multiplication. \u2b50 is twice \u25c6, so when multiplied by \u25c6, it results in 2 times \u25c6 squared. Expressing \u25c6 in terms of \u2b50 gives half of \u2b50, leading to the final expression.\n\n\u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = (2\u25c6) \u00d7 \u25c6 = 2\u25c6\u00b2  \nSince \u25c6 = \u2b50 / 2,  \n2\u25c6\u00b2 = 2*(\u2b50 / 2)\u00b2 = 2*(\u2b50\u00b2 / 4) = \u2b50\u00b2 / 2.\n\n**Answer:** \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = \\boxed{\\dfrac{\\text{\u2b50}^2}{2}}  \nDONE."

End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: In a symbolic substitution system, the following equations are true:\n\n\u2b50 + \u25c6 = \u25b2\n\u25c6 + \u25c6 = \u2b50\n\u25b2 - \u25c6 = \u2666\n\u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = ?\n\nIf each symbol represents a consistent value throughout the system, what does \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 equal? Express your answer in terms of the given symbols. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I've got this problem here with some symbols and equations, and I need to figure out what \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 equals. Let me try to break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, let me write down all the given equations to see if I can solve for each symbol in terms of the others. The equations are:\n\n1. \u2b50 + \u25c6 = \u25b2\n2. \u25c6 + \u25c6 = \u2b50\n3. \u25b2 - \u25c6 = \u2666\n4. \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = ?\n\nOkay, so we have four equations with four unknowns: \u2b50, \u25c6, \u25b2, and \u2666. That should be solvable, right? Let me see how to approach this.\n\nStarting with equation 2: \u25c6 + \u25c6 = \u2b50. That simplifies to 2\u25c6 = \u2b50, so I can express \u2b50 in terms of \u25c6. Let me write that down:\n\n\u2b50 = 2\u25c6\n\nThat's helpful because now I can substitute \u2b50 with 2\u25c6 in other equations. Let's move to equation 1: \u2b50 + \u25c6 = \u25b2. Substituting \u2b50 with 2\u25c6, we get:\n\n2\u25c6 + \u25c6 = \u25b2\n3\u25c6 = \u25b2\n\nSo, \u25b2 is equal to 3\u25c6. Got it:\n\n\u25b2 = 3\u25c6\n\nNow, moving to equation 3: \u25b2 - \u25c6 = \u2666. Since I know \u25b2 is 3\u25c6, I can substitute that in:\n\n3\u25c6 - \u25c6 = \u2666\n2\u25c6 = \u2666\n\nSo, \u2666 is also equal to 2\u25c6. Interesting, both \u2b50 and \u2666 are 2\u25c6. That might be useful later.\n\nNow, going back to equation 4: \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = ?. Since I know that \u2b50 = 2\u25c6, I can substitute that in:\n\n2\u25c6 \u00d7 \u25c6 = ?\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n2\u25c6\u00b2 = ?\n\nSo, the product \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 is 2 times the square of \u25c6. But I need to express the answer in terms of the given symbols, so I need to find what each symbol represents in numerical terms or find a relation between them.\n\nWait, let me see if I can find numerical values for each symbol. I have:\n\n- \u2b50 = 2\u25c6\n- \u25b2 = 3\u25c6\n- \u2666 = 2\u25c6\n  \nSo, all symbols are expressed in terms of \u25c6. I wonder if I can find the value of \u25c6. Let's see if I can express everything in terms of one variable or find a relationship that allows me to solve for \u25c6.\n\nBut wait, do I have enough equations? Let me check:\n\nFrom equation 1: \u2b50 + \u25c6 = \u25b2\nWe have \u2b50 = 2\u25c6 and \u25b2 = 3\u25c6, so substituting gives 2\u25c6 + \u25c6 = 3\u25c6, which is 3\u25c6 = 3\u25c6. That's just a true statement, doesn't give me new info.\n\nFrom equation 2: 2\u25c6 = \u2b50 (already used)\nFrom equation 3: 2\u25c6 = \u2666 (already used)\nFrom equation 4: 2\u25c6\u00b2 = ?\n\nSo, I don't have another equation that can help me solve for \u25c6 numerically. It seems like all symbols are expressed in terms of \u25c6, and without another equation, I can't find a numerical value for \u25c6. But the question asks for the product \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 in terms of the given symbols, which is 2\u25c6\u00b2. However, I need to express it using the symbols, not in terms of numbers or another variable.\n\nWait, maybe I can express \u25c6 in terms of another symbol. Let me see if that's possible.\n\nLooking back at the equations:\n\n- \u2b50 = 2\u25c6\n- \u25b2 = 3\u25c6\n- \u2666 = 2\u25c6\n\nIs there a way to express \u25c6 in terms of \u25b2 or \u2666? Let's see.\n\nFrom \u25b2 = 3\u25c6, we can write \u25c6 = \u25b2 / 3.\n\nSimilarly, from \u2666 = 2\u25c6, we can write \u25c6 = \u2666 / 2.\n\nSo, both expressions equal \u25c6. Therefore, \u25b2 / 3 must equal \u2666 / 2. Let me write that:\n\n\u25b2 / 3 = \u2666 / 2\n\nCross-multiplying gives:\n\n2\u25b2 = 3\u2666\n\nSo, 2\u25b2 = 3\u2666. That's a new equation relating \u25b2 and \u2666.\n\nBut I don't have another equation involving \u25b2 and \u2666. Let me check the given equations:\n\nEquation 3: \u25b2 - \u25c6 = \u2666. We've used that already.\n\nSo, now I have 2\u25b2 = 3\u2666, which is a relation between \u25b2 and \u2666. But without another equation, I can't solve for \u25b2 or \u2666 numerically. Therefore, it seems like the system is underdetermined in terms of numerical values, but perhaps we can express the product \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 in terms of existing symbols.\n\nWait, but earlier I found that \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = 2\u25c6\u00b2. Maybe I can express \u25c6\u00b2 in terms of other symbols.\n\nLet me think. If I can express \u25c6 in terms of another symbol, say \u25b2, then I can write \u25c6 = \u25b2 / 3. Therefore, \u25c6\u00b2 = (\u25b2 / 3)\u00b2 = \u25b2\u00b2 / 9.\n\nSo, substituting back into the product:\n\n\u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = 2\u25c6\u00b2 = 2 \u00d7 (\u25b2\u00b2 / 9) = (2/9)\u25b2\u00b2\n\nBut I don't know if that helps because I still have \u25b2 in there. Alternatively, since \u2666 = 2\u25c6, then \u25c6 = \u2666 / 2. So, \u25c6\u00b2 = (\u2666 / 2)\u00b2 = \u2666\u00b2 / 4.\n\nSubstituting back:\n\n\u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = 2\u25c6\u00b2 = 2 \u00d7 (\u2666\u00b2 / 4) = (2/4)\u2666\u00b2 = (1/2)\u2666\u00b2\n\nSo, it's either (2/9)\u25b2\u00b2 or (1/2)\u2666\u00b2. But neither seems to eliminate symbols entirely. Maybe I need a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, since I have \u2b50 = 2\u25c6 and \u25b2 = 3\u25c6, perhaps I can express the product in terms of \u25b2.\n\nFrom \u2b50 = 2\u25c6 and \u25b2 = 3\u25c6, then \u25c6 = \u25b2 / 3.\n\nTherefore, \u2b50 = 2 \u00d7 (\u25b2 / 3) = (2/3)\u25b2\n\nSo, \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = (2/3)\u25b2 \u00d7 (\u25b2 / 3) = (2/3) \u00d7 (1/3) \u00d7 \u25b2\u00b2 = (2/9)\u25b2\u00b2\n\nSo, that's the same as before. Similarly, using \u2666 = 2\u25c6, so \u25c6 = \u2666 / 2.\n\nThen, \u2b50 = 2 \u00d7 (\u2666 / 2) = \u2666\n\nSo, \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = \u2666 \u00d7 (\u2666 / 2) = (\u2666\u00b2) / 2\n\nAgain, same result. So, the product can be expressed in terms of \u25b2 or \u2666, but not in terms of a single symbol without fractions.\n\nWait, but the question asks to express the answer in terms of the given symbols, so maybe (2/9)\u25b2\u00b2 or (1/2)\u2666\u00b2 is acceptable. However, I suspect there's a way to express it without fractions or with integers, perhaps.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe I can find the value of \u25c6 by assuming a value for one of the symbols. Let's say I assume \u25c6 = 1. Then:\n\n- \u2b50 = 2\u00d71 = 2\n- \u25b2 = 3\u00d71 = 3\n- \u2666 = 2\u00d71 = 2\n\nThen, checking equation 3: \u25b2 - \u25c6 = 3 - 1 = 2, which equals \u2666. So, that works.\n\nSo, if \u25c6=1, then:\n\n- \u2b50=2\n- \u25b2=3\n- \u2666=2\n\nThen, \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = 2 \u00d7 1 = 2.\n\nBut the question is to express the answer in terms of the given symbols, not in numbers. So, if \u25c6=1, then \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = 2, which is equal to \u2b50, since \u2b50=2 when \u25c6=1. But that's just restating the same thing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express the product as a combination of other symbols. Let's see.\n\nFrom the earlier equations:\n\n- \u2b50 = 2\u25c6\n- \u25b2 = 3\u25c6\n- \u2666 = 2\u25c6\n\nSo, perhaps I can write the product as:\n\n\u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = 2\u25c6 \u00d7 \u25c6 = 2\u25c6\u00b2\n\nBut I need to express \u25c6\u00b2 in terms of other symbols. Let's see.\n\nFrom \u25b2 = 3\u25c6, so \u25c6 = \u25b2 / 3. Therefore, \u25c6\u00b2 = (\u25b2 / 3)\u00b2 = \u25b2\u00b2 / 9.\n\nSo, \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = 2 \u00d7 (\u25b2\u00b2 / 9) = (2/9)\u25b2\u00b2\n\nAlternatively, from \u2666 = 2\u25c6, so \u25c6 = \u2666 / 2. Then, \u25c6\u00b2 = (\u2666 / 2)\u00b2 = \u2666\u00b2 / 4.\n\nThus, \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = 2 \u00d7 (\u2666\u00b2 / 4) = (2/4)\u2666\u00b2 = (1/2)\u2666\u00b2\n\nSo, depending on which symbol I express it in, it's either (2/9)\u25b2\u00b2 or (1/2)\u2666\u00b2.\n\nBut the question says \"express your answer in terms of the given symbols.\" So, I think either of these forms is acceptable because they express the answer using the given symbols.\n\nHowever, I recall that sometimes in these substitution systems, you can find a numerical value by assigning a value to one symbol and then finding the rest. For example, if I let \u25c6 = 1, then:\n\n- \u2b50 = 2\n- \u25b2 = 3\n- \u2666 = 2\n\nThen, the product \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = 2 \u00d7 1 = 2. But since the question wants the answer in terms of the symbols, not numbers, I can't just say 2. Instead, I need to express it symbolically.\n\nWait, but if I assign \u25c6 = 1, then the product is 2, which is equal to \u2b50. So, \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = \u2b50. But that might not be correct because \u2b50 is 2 and \u25c6 is 1, so 2 \u00d7 1 = 2, which is \u2b50. But in terms of symbols, it's just \u2b50, which is the same as the product. That seems a bit circular.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find another relation. Let me think.\n\nFrom equation 3: \u25b2 - \u25c6 = \u2666. We know \u25b2 = 3\u25c6 and \u2666 = 2\u25c6. So, substituting:\n\n3\u25c6 - \u25c6 = 2\u25c6\n2\u25c6 = 2\u25c6\n\nAgain, just a true statement, doesn't help.\n\nWait, maybe I can use equation 1 and equation 2 together.\n\nFrom equation 1: \u2b50 + \u25c6 = \u25b2\nFrom equation 2: \u2b50 = 2\u25c6\n\nSubstituting into equation 1:\n\n2\u25c6 + \u25c6 = \u25b2\n3\u25c6 = \u25b2\n\nWhich is consistent with what we have.\n\nSo, I think I can't get a numerical value for \u25c6 without more information. Therefore, the product \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 must be expressed in terms of \u25c6, which is 2\u25c6\u00b2, or alternatively in terms of \u25b2 or \u2666 as (2/9)\u25b2\u00b2 or (1/2)\u2666\u00b2.\n\nBut I think the simplest way is to express it as 2\u25c6\u00b2, since that directly comes from the substitution.\n\nAlternatively, if I can express \u25c6\u00b2 in terms of another symbol, but I don't see a direct way without fractions.\n\nWait, another approach: since I have \u25b2 = 3\u25c6 and \u2666 = 2\u25c6, then I can write:\n\nFrom \u25b2 = 3\u25c6, so \u25c6 = \u25b2 / 3\n\nFrom \u2666 = 2\u25c6, so \u25c6 = \u2666 / 2\n\nTherefore, \u25b2 / 3 = \u2666 / 2 \u2192 2\u25b2 = 3\u2666\n\nSo, 2\u25b2 = 3\u2666 \u2192 \u25b2 = (3/2)\u2666\n\nBut I don't know if that helps.\n\nIf I substitute \u25b2 = (3/2)\u2666 into the product:\n\n\u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = 2\u25c6\u00b2\n\nBut I need to express \u25c6 in terms of \u2666:\n\n\u25c6 = \u2666 / 2\n\nSo, \u25c6\u00b2 = (\u2666\u00b2) / 4\n\nThus, \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = 2 \u00d7 (\u2666\u00b2 / 4) = (1/2)\u2666\u00b2\n\nSo, that's the same as before.\n\nAlternatively, using \u25b2:\n\n\u25c6 = \u25b2 / 3\n\nSo, \u25c6\u00b2 = (\u25b2\u00b2) / 9\n\nThus, \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = 2 \u00d7 (\u25b2\u00b2 / 9) = (2/9)\u25b2\u00b2\n\nSo, either way, it's expressed in terms of another symbol with a coefficient.\n\nBut I think the problem expects the answer in terms of the given symbols without fractions, perhaps. Let me check.\n\nWait, maybe I can find another relation. Let me think about the system again.\n\nWe have:\n\n1. \u2b50 + \u25c6 = \u25b2\n2. 2\u25c6 = \u2b50\n3. 2\u25c6 = \u2666\n4. Need to find \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6\n\nFrom equation 1 and 2:\n\nFrom equation 2: \u2b50 = 2\u25c6\n\nSubstitute into equation 1:\n\n2\u25c6 + \u25c6 = \u25b2 \u2192 3\u25c6 = \u25b2\n\nFrom equation 3: 2\u25c6 = \u2666\n\nSo, now we have:\n\n\u25b2 = 3\u25c6\n\n\u2666 = 2\u25c6\n\nTherefore, all symbols are expressed in terms of \u25c6. So, the product is:\n\n\u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = 2\u25c6 \u00d7 \u25c6 = 2\u25c6\u00b2\n\nBut I need to express this in terms of the given symbols without introducing new variables. Since I can't assign a numerical value to \u25c6 without more information, I think the answer has to be in terms of \u25c6 squared, multiplied by 2.\n\nAlternatively, if I can express \u25c6\u00b2 in terms of another symbol. Let's see.\n\nFrom \u25b2 = 3\u25c6, so \u25c6 = \u25b2 / 3\n\nThen, \u25c6\u00b2 = (\u25b2 / 3)\u00b2 = \u25b2\u00b2 / 9\n\nThus, \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = 2 \u00d7 (\u25b2\u00b2 / 9) = (2/9)\u25b2\u00b2\n\nSimilarly, from \u2666 = 2\u25c6, so \u25c6 = \u2666 / 2\n\nThus, \u25c6\u00b2 = (\u2666 / 2)\u00b2 = \u2666\u00b2 / 4\n\nTherefore, \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = 2 \u00d7 (\u2666\u00b2 / 4) = (1/2)\u2666\u00b2\n\nSo, the product can be expressed in terms of \u25b2 or \u2666 with coefficients.\n\nBut the question says \"express your answer in terms of the given symbols,\" so I think any of these forms is acceptable. However, I suspect that the intended answer is simply 2\u25c6\u00b2 because that's the most direct substitution from the given equations.\n\nAlternatively, if I can express \u25c6\u00b2 in terms of another symbol without fractions, but I don't see a way. Therefore, I think the answer is either 2\u25c6\u00b2, (2/9)\u25b2\u00b2, or (1/2)\u2666\u00b2.\n\nBut to make it as simple as possible, and given that the problem might expect the answer in terms of the given symbols without fractions, I think 2\u25c6\u00b2 is the most straightforward.\n\nHowever, I should check if there's a way to express it without using \u25c6. Let me think.\n\nSince I have:\n\n- \u2b50 = 2\u25c6\n- \u25b2 = 3\u25c6\n- \u2666 = 2\u25c6\n\nI can express \u25c6 in terms of \u25b2 or \u2666, but that introduces fractions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write the product as a combination of other symbols.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nFrom equation 3: \u25b2 - \u25c6 = \u2666\n\nWe have \u25b2 = 3\u25c6 and \u2666 = 2\u25c6, so:\n\n3\u25c6 - \u25c6 = 2\u25c6 \u2192 2\u25c6 = 2\u25c6, which is just an identity.\n\nNot helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find a relation between \u2b50 and \u2666.\n\nFrom \u2b50 = 2\u25c6 and \u2666 = 2\u25c6, so \u2b50 = \u2666.\n\nTherefore, the product \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = \u2666 \u00d7 \u25c6\n\nBut since \u2666 = 2\u25c6, then:\n\n\u2666 \u00d7 \u25c6 = 2\u25c6 \u00d7 \u25c6 = 2\u25c6\u00b2\n\nSo, that's the same as before.\n\nAlternatively, since \u2b50 = \u2666, then:\n\n\u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = \u2666 \u00d7 \u25c6\n\nBut I don't think that helps.\n\nI think I've exhausted all possible substitutions, and the product can only be expressed in terms of \u25c6 squared or another symbol with a coefficient.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 2\u25c6\u00b2, which can also be expressed as (1/2)\u2666\u00b2 or (2/9)\u25b2\u00b2, but the simplest form is 2\u25c6\u00b2.\n\nSo, I think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the system of equations:\n\n1. \u2b50 + \u25c6 = \u25b2  \n2. \u25c6 + \u25c6 = \u2b50  \n3. \u25b2 - \u25c6 = \u2666  \n4. \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = ?\n\nWe start by expressing each symbol in terms of \u25c6:\n\n- From equation 2: \u2b50 = 2\u25c6  \n- From equation 1: \u25b2 = 3\u25c6  \n- From equation 3: \u2666 = 2\u25c6  \n\nSubstituting these into equation 4:\n\n\u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = 2\u25c6 \u00d7 \u25c6 = 2\u25c6\u00b2\n\nThus, the product \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 equals 2\u25c6 squared.\n\n**Answer:** \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = 2\u25c6\u00b2  \nDONE."

End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: In a symbolic substitution system, the following equations are true:\n\n\u2b50 + \u25c6 = \u25b2\n\u25c6 + \u25c6 = \u2b50\n\u25b2 - \u25c6 = \u2666\n\u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = ?\n\nIf each symbol represents a consistent value throughout the system, what does \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 equal? Express your answer in terms of the given symbols. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I have this system of equations with symbols, and I need to figure out what \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 equals. Let me write down the equations first to make it clearer.\n\nThe equations are:\n1. \u2b50 + \u25c6 = \u25b2\n2. \u25c6 + \u25c6 = \u2b50\n3. \u25b2 - \u25c6 = \u2666\n4. \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = ?\n\nHmm, each symbol represents a consistent value, so I need to express everything in terms of one variable or find relationships between them. Let me start by labeling each symbol to make it easier.\n\nLet me assign variables:\n- Let\u2019s say \u2b50 = A\n- \u25c6 = B\n- \u25b2 = C\n- \u2666 = D\n\nSo now, the equations become:\n1. A + B = C\n2. B + B = A\n3. C - B = D\n4. A \u00d7 B = ?\n\nAlright, now I can try to solve for the variables step by step.\n\nStarting with equation 2: B + B = A. That simplifies to 2B = A, so A = 2B. Got that.\n\nNow, equation 1: A + B = C. Since A is 2B, substitute that in: 2B + B = C. So 3B = C. Therefore, C = 3B.\n\nMoving on to equation 3: C - B = D. We know C is 3B, so substitute that in: 3B - B = D. That simplifies to 2B = D.\n\nSo now, I have:\n- A = 2B\n- C = 3B\n- D = 2B\n\nAll in terms of B. Now, I need to find A \u00d7 B, which is 2B \u00d7 B. So 2B \u00d7 B = 2B\u00b2.\n\nBut wait, the question asks for the answer in terms of the given symbols, not in terms of B. So I need to express 2B\u00b2 using the symbols A, B, C, D, etc.\n\nLooking back at the equations:\n- From equation 2: A = 2B\n- From equation 1: C = 3B\n- From equation 3: D = 2B\n\nSo, B is a common term here. Let me see if I can express B in terms of A, C, or D.\n\nFrom A = 2B, we can solve for B: B = A/2.\n\nSimilarly, from D = 2B, B = D/2.\n\nSo both A and D are twice B. That means A = D.\n\nWait, is that correct? Because if A = 2B and D = 2B, then A = D. So A equals D.\n\nSimilarly, C = 3B, which is 1.5 times A (since A = 2B). So C = 1.5A or (3/2)A.\n\nBut maybe I don't need to go that far. Let's get back to the expression A \u00d7 B, which is 2B \u00d7 B = 2B\u00b2.\n\nI need to express 2B\u00b2 in terms of the symbols. Let's see if I can find B\u00b2 in terms of other symbols.\n\nFrom A = 2B, we can write B = A/2.\n\nSo B\u00b2 = (A/2)\u00b2 = A\u00b2/4.\n\nTherefore, 2B\u00b2 = 2 \u00d7 (A\u00b2/4) = A\u00b2/2.\n\nSo A \u00d7 B = 2B\u00b2 = A\u00b2/2.\n\nBut the question asks for the answer in terms of the given symbols, which are \u2b50, \u25c6, \u25b2, and \u2666.\n\nSince A is \u2b50 and B is \u25c6, let me substitute back:\n\nA\u00b2/2 = (\u2b50)\u00b2 / 2.\n\nAlternatively, since we have other symbols, maybe we can express it differently.\n\nFrom equation 3: D = 2B, so B = D/2.\n\nThen B\u00b2 = (D/2)\u00b2 = D\u00b2/4.\n\nSo 2B\u00b2 = 2 \u00d7 (D\u00b2/4) = D\u00b2/2.\n\nThus, A \u00d7 B = D\u00b2/2.\n\nBut earlier, I had A \u00d7 B = A\u00b2/2. So both expressions are correct, depending on which variable we express it in.\n\nAlternatively, since C = 3B and B = C/3, then B\u00b2 = (C/3)\u00b2 = C\u00b2/9.\n\nSo 2B\u00b2 = 2C\u00b2/9 = (2C\u00b2)/9.\n\nTherefore, A \u00d7 B = (2C\u00b2)/9.\n\nBut I need to see if I can find a consistent expression in terms of the symbols given.\n\nWait, let me check if A equals D.\n\nFrom above, A = 2B and D = 2B, so yes, A = D.\n\nSo A = D. Therefore, A \u00d7 B = D \u00d7 B.\n\nBut D = 2B, so D \u00d7 B = 2B \u00d7 B = 2B\u00b2.\n\nBut we already have A \u00d7 B = 2B\u00b2, and since A = D, that means D \u00d7 B = A \u00d7 B.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express B in terms of C.\n\nFrom C = 3B, B = C/3.\n\nSo B\u00b2 = (C/3)\u00b2 = C\u00b2/9.\n\nThus, 2B\u00b2 = 2C\u00b2/9.\n\nSo A \u00d7 B = 2C\u00b2/9.\n\nBut I need to express it in terms of the given symbols, so maybe in terms of C.\n\nAlternatively, since A = D, and D is \u2666, so A is also \u2666. Therefore, A = \u2666.\n\nSo A \u00d7 B = \u2666 \u00d7 B.\n\nBut A = \u2666, so \u2666 \u00d7 B.\n\nAlternatively, since A = \u2666, and A \u00d7 B = \u2666 \u00d7 B.\n\nBut I think the simplest way is to express it in terms of A, which is \u2b50.\n\nFrom above, A \u00d7 B = 2B\u00b2, and since A = 2B, then B = A/2.\n\nSo B\u00b2 = (A/2)\u00b2 = A\u00b2/4.\n\nThus, 2B\u00b2 = 2 \u00d7 (A\u00b2/4) = A\u00b2/2.\n\nTherefore, A \u00d7 B = A\u00b2/2.\n\nSo in terms of symbols, \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = (\u2b50)\u00b2 / 2.\n\nAlternatively, since A = D, maybe we can express it as D\u00b2 / 2.\n\nBut let me check if that's consistent.\n\nFrom D = 2B, and A = 2B, so A = D.\n\nThus, A \u00d7 B = D \u00d7 B.\n\nBut D = 2B, so D \u00d7 B = 2B \u00d7 B = 2B\u00b2.\n\nWhich is the same as A \u00d7 B = 2B\u00b2.\n\nAlternatively, since A = D, D \u00d7 B = A \u00d7 B = 2B\u00b2.\n\nBut I need to see if I can write it in terms of other symbols.\n\nWait, from equation 1: A + B = C.\n\nWe have A = 2B, so 2B + B = 3B = C.\n\nSo C = 3B.\n\nThus, B = C/3.\n\nSo B\u00b2 = (C/3)\u00b2 = C\u00b2/9.\n\nTherefore, 2B\u00b2 = 2C\u00b2/9.\n\nSo A \u00d7 B = 2C\u00b2/9.\n\nBut is that better? Maybe, but the question doesn't specify in terms of which symbol, so perhaps expressing it in terms of A is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, since A = D, and D is \u2666, we can write A \u00d7 B = \u2666 \u00d7 B.\n\nBut B is \u25c6, so \u2666 \u00d7 \u25c6.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can find a relation that allows us to express A \u00d7 B as a multiple of another symbol.\n\nWait, from equation 3: C - B = D.\n\nWe have C = 3B, so 3B - B = 2B = D.\n\nSo D = 2B.\n\nTherefore, B = D/2.\n\nSo A \u00d7 B = (2B) \u00d7 B = 2B\u00b2.\n\nBut B = D/2, so B\u00b2 = (D/2)\u00b2 = D\u00b2/4.\n\nThus, 2B\u00b2 = 2 \u00d7 (D\u00b2/4) = D\u00b2/2.\n\nSo A \u00d7 B = D\u00b2/2.\n\nSince D is \u2666, that would be \u2666 squared divided by 2.\n\nBut the question says to express the answer in terms of the given symbols, so that would be acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, since A = D, and A \u00d7 B = A\u00b2/2, which is also acceptable.\n\nBut let me check if I made any mistakes.\n\nFrom equation 2: B + B = A \u2192 2B = A.\n\nEquation 1: A + B = C \u2192 2B + B = 3B = C.\n\nEquation 3: C - B = D \u2192 3B - B = 2B = D.\n\nSo yes, A = D = 2B.\n\nTherefore, A \u00d7 B = 2B \u00d7 B = 2B\u00b2.\n\nBut we can also express B in terms of A: B = A/2.\n\nThus, B\u00b2 = (A/2)\u00b2 = A\u00b2/4.\n\nSo 2B\u00b2 = 2 \u00d7 (A\u00b2/4) = A\u00b2/2.\n\nTherefore, A \u00d7 B = A\u00b2/2.\n\nSo in terms of symbols, \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = (\u2b50)\u00b2 / 2.\n\nAlternatively, since A = D, it's also D\u00b2 / 2.\n\nBut since the question uses symbols like \u25b2, \u25c6, etc., maybe it's better to express it in terms of \u25b2.\n\nFrom equation 1: C = 3B.\n\nFrom equation 2: A = 2B.\n\nSo B = A/2 = C/3.\n\nThus, A = 2B = 2*(C/3) = (2/3)C.\n\nSo A = (2/3)C.\n\nTherefore, A\u00b2 = (4/9)C\u00b2.\n\nSo A\u00b2/2 = (4/9)C\u00b2 / 2 = (2/9)C\u00b2.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's helpful.\n\nAlternatively, since C = 3B and D = 2B, then C = (3/2)D.\n\nBecause D = 2B, so B = D/2.\n\nThus, C = 3B = 3*(D/2) = (3/2)D.\n\nSo C = (3/2)D.\n\nTherefore, C\u00b2 = (9/4)D\u00b2.\n\nThus, 2C\u00b2/9 = 2*(9/4)D\u00b2 / 9 = (18/4)D\u00b2 /9 = (18/36)D\u00b2 = D\u00b2/2.\n\nSo A \u00d7 B = 2C\u00b2/9 = D\u00b2/2.\n\nTherefore, confirming that A \u00d7 B = D\u00b2/2.\n\nSince D is \u2666, that would be \u2666 squared over two.\n\nBut the question says to express it in terms of the given symbols, so either A\u00b2/2 or D\u00b2/2 is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, since C = 3B and D = 2B, we can write C = (3/2)D.\n\nSo C = (3/2)D.\n\nThus, C\u00b2 = (9/4)D\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, 2C\u00b2/9 = 2*(9/4)D\u00b2 /9 = (18/4)D\u00b2 /9 = (18/36)D\u00b2 = D\u00b2/2.\n\nSo again, A \u00d7 B = D\u00b2/2.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \u2666 squared over two, or D\u00b2/2.\n\nBut the symbols are \u2b50, \u25c6, \u25b2, and \u2666, so I can write it as \u2666\u00b2/2.\n\nAlternatively, in LaTeX, that would be \\frac{\u2666^2}{2}.\n\nBut since the question uses symbols like \u25b2, \u25c6, etc., perhaps it's better to express it in terms of one of those.\n\nAlternatively, since A \u00d7 B = A\u00b2/2, and A is \u2b50, so \u2b50\u00b2/2.\n\nBut maybe the answer is to be expressed as (\u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6) = (\u2b50)\u00b2 / 2.\n\nAlternatively, since A = D, then A \u00d7 B = D \u00d7 B.\n\nBut D is \u2666, so \u2666 \u00d7 B.\n\nBut B is \u25c6, so \u2666 \u00d7 \u25c6.\n\nBut we need a numerical value or an expression in terms of the symbols.\n\nWait, but in the system, all symbols are related through B.\n\nSo the product A \u00d7 B is 2B\u00b2, which is equal to A\u00b2/2 or D\u00b2/2.\n\nBut I think the simplest way is to express it as A\u00b2/2, which is (\u2b50)\u00b2 / 2.\n\nAlternatively, since A = D, and D is \u2666, so (\u2666)\u00b2 / 2.\n\nBut I think in the context of the problem, expressing it in terms of \u2b50 and \u25c6 is acceptable.\n\nSo \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = (\u2b50)\u00b2 / 2.\n\nAlternatively, since A = D, and A \u00d7 B = D \u00d7 B, but I don't think that adds any new information.\n\nSo to sum up, the answer is (\u2b50)\u00b2 / 2, which can be written as (\u2b50 \u00d7 \u2b50) / 2, but in terms of multiplication, it's \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = (\u2b50)\u00b2 / 2.\n\nAlternatively, since A \u00d7 B = A\u00b2/2, and A = \u2b50, that's the simplest expression.\n\nSo I think the answer is (\u2b50)\u00b2 / 2, or in LaTeX, \\frac{\u2b50^2}{2}.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nFrom the equations:\n1. A + B = C\n2. 2B = A\n3. C - B = D\n4. A \u00d7 B = ?\n\nFrom equation 2, A = 2B.\n\nFrom equation 1, C = 3B.\n\nFrom equation 3, D = 2B.\n\nSo A = D.\n\nTherefore, A \u00d7 B = D \u00d7 B.\n\nBut D = 2B, so D \u00d7 B = 2B \u00d7 B = 2B\u00b2.\n\nBut B = A/2, so B\u00b2 = (A/2)\u00b2 = A\u00b2/4.\n\nThus, 2B\u00b2 = 2 \u00d7 (A\u00b2/4) = A\u00b2/2.\n\nTherefore, A \u00d7 B = A\u00b2/2.\n\nSo yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, since D = 2B, and A = D, then A = 2B, so B = A/2.\n\nThus, A \u00d7 B = A \u00d7 (A/2) = A\u00b2/2.\n\nSo either way, it's A\u00b2/2.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \u2b50 squared over two, which is (\u2b50 \u00d7 \u2b50) / 2.\n\nBut in the system, the multiplication is represented as \u00d7, so \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6.\n\nWait, but the question is asking for \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6, which is A \u00d7 B, which is 2B\u00b2, which is A\u00b2/2.\n\nSo the answer is A\u00b2/2, which is (\u2b50)\u00b2 / 2.\n\nAlternatively, since A = D, and D is \u2666, it's \u2666 squared over two.\n\nBut I think the answer is expected to be expressed in terms of the given symbols, so probably (\u2b50 \u00d7 \u2b50) / 2 or (\u2b50)\u00b2 / 2.\n\nBut let me check if I can express it differently.\n\nFrom equation 3: D = 2B.\n\nFrom equation 2: A = 2B.\n\nSo D = A.\n\nThus, A \u00d7 B = D \u00d7 B.\n\nBut D = A, so A \u00d7 B = A \u00d7 B.\n\nThat doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, from equation 1: C = A + B.\n\nFrom equation 2: A = 2B.\n\nSo C = 2B + B = 3B.\n\nFrom equation 3: D = C - B = 3B - B = 2B.\n\nSo D = 2B.\n\nThus, A = D.\n\nTherefore, A \u00d7 B = D \u00d7 B = 2B \u00d7 B = 2B\u00b2.\n\nBut B = A/2, so 2B\u00b2 = 2*(A\u00b2/4) = A\u00b2/2.\n\nSo yes, same result.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (\u2b50)\u00b2 / 2.\n\nAlternatively, since A = D, it's (\u2666)\u00b2 / 2.\n\nBut since the question uses symbols like \u25b2, \u25c6, etc., maybe it's better to express it in terms of \u25b2.\n\nFrom C = 3B, and D = 2B, so C = (3/2)D.\n\nThus, C = (3/2)D.\n\nTherefore, D = (2/3)C.\n\nThus, D\u00b2 = (4/9)C\u00b2.\n\nSo D\u00b2 / 2 = (4/9)C\u00b2 / 2 = (2/9)C\u00b2.\n\nBut A \u00d7 B = D\u00b2 / 2 = (2/9)C\u00b2.\n\nBut C = 3B, so C\u00b2 = 9B\u00b2.\n\nThus, (2/9)C\u00b2 = (2/9)*9B\u00b2 = 2B\u00b2.\n\nWhich brings us back to A \u00d7 B = 2B\u00b2.\n\nSo again, confirming that A \u00d7 B = 2B\u00b2 = A\u00b2/2.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (\u2b50)\u00b2 / 2.\n\nI think that's the simplest way to express it in terms of the given symbols.\n\nSo the final answer is (\u2b50)\u00b2 / 2, which can be written as (\u2b50 \u00d7 \u2b50) / 2 or \\frac{\u2b50^2}{2}.\n\nBut since the question uses \u00d7, it's better to write it as \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = (\u2b50)\u00b2 / 2.\n\nAlternatively, since A = D, it's \u2666 \u00d7 \u25c6 = (\u2666)\u00b2 / 2.\n\nBut I think expressing it in terms of \u2b50 is more direct.\n\nSo the answer is (\u2b50)\u00b2 / 2.\n</think>\n\n\u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = (\u2b50)\u00b2 / 2\n\nDONE."

Express your answer in terms of the given symbols. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I've got this problem here with a bunch of symbols and equations, and I need to figure out what \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 equals. Let me try to break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, let me list out the equations to have them clear:\n\n1. \u2b50 + \u25c6 = \u25b2\n2. \u25c6 + \u25c6 = \u2b50\n3. \u25b2 - \u25c6 = \u2666\n4. \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = ?\n\nOkay, so each symbol represents a consistent value, which probably means they are numbers or maybe variables, but in this context, since it's a substitution system, they must be numbers. So, I need to find what each symbol stands for in terms of numbers or maybe express them in terms of each other.\n\nStarting with equation 2: \u25c6 + \u25c6 = \u2b50. That simplifies to 2 \u25c6 = \u2b50. So, \u2b50 is twice the value of \u25c6. Let me write that down: \u2b50 = 2 \u00d7 \u25c6.\n\nNow, equation 1 says \u2b50 + \u25c6 = \u25b2. Since I know that \u2b50 is 2 \u00d7 \u25c6, I can substitute that into equation 1. So, 2 \u00d7 \u25c6 + \u25c6 = \u25b2. Combining like terms, that gives me 3 \u00d7 \u25c6 = \u25b2. So, \u25b2 = 3 \u00d7 \u25c6.\n\nMoving on to equation 3: \u25b2 - \u25c6 = \u2666. I've already expressed \u25b2 in terms of \u25c6, so substituting that in, I get 3 \u00d7 \u25c6 - \u25c6 = \u2666. Simplifying that, it's 2 \u00d7 \u25c6 = \u2666. So, \u2666 = 2 \u00d7 \u25c6.\n\nNow, equation 4 is \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = ?. But I already know that \u2b50 is 2 \u00d7 \u25c6, so substituting that in, it becomes (2 \u00d7 \u25c6) \u00d7 \u25c6. Multiplying those together, that's 2 \u00d7 (\u25c6 \u00d7 \u25c6) or 2 \u00d7 (\u25c6\u00b2). So, \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 equals 2 \u00d7 \u25c6 squared.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. If \u2b50 is 2 \u00d7 \u25c6, then multiplying that by \u25c6 would indeed give 2 \u00d7 \u25c6 \u00d7 \u25c6, which is 2 \u00d7 (\u25c6 squared). Yeah, that seems right.\n\nLet me recap what I've found:\n\n- From equation 2: \u2b50 = 2 \u00d7 \u25c6\n- From equation 1: \u25b2 = 3 \u00d7 \u25c6\n- From equation 3: \u2666 = 2 \u00d7 \u25c6\n- From equation 4: \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = 2 \u00d7 (\u25c6 squared)\n\nSo, putting it all together, the value of \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 is twice the square of \u25c6. That makes sense because both \u2b50 and \u25b2 are multiples of \u25c6, and \u2666 ends up being another multiple of \u25c6 as well.\n\nI don't see any contradictions in these relationships. Each equation seems to build on the previous one, and the substitutions check out. So, I think I've got the right answer here.\n</think>\n\nThe value of \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 is 2 \u00d7 (\u25c6\u00b2). \n\nDONE."

Express your answer in terms of the given symbols. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this symbolic substitution system with four symbols: \u2b50, \u25c6, \u25b2, and \u2666. The equations given are:\n\n1. \u2b50 + \u25c6 = \u25b2\n2. \u25c6 + \u25c6 = \u2b50\n3. \u25b2 - \u25c6 = \u2666\n4. \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = ?\n\nMy goal is to find what \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 equals, expressed in terms of the symbols. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at equation 2: \u25c6 + \u25c6 = \u2b50. This simplifies to 2\u25c6 = \u2b50. So, I can express \u2b50 in terms of \u25c6. That is, \u2b50 = 2\u25c6. That seems straightforward.\n\nNow, equation 1 says \u2b50 + \u25c6 = \u25b2. Since I know \u2b50 is 2\u25c6, I can substitute that in: 2\u25c6 + \u25c6 = \u25b2. Adding those together gives 3\u25c6 = \u25b2. So, \u25b2 is equal to 3\u25c6.\n\nMoving on to equation 3: \u25b2 - \u25c6 = \u2666. We just found that \u25b2 is 3\u25c6, so substituting that in: 3\u25c6 - \u25c6 = \u2666. Subtracting gives 2\u25c6 = \u2666. So, \u2666 is equal to 2\u25c6 as well.\n\nWait a second, that's interesting. Both \u2b50 and \u2666 are equal to 2\u25c6. So, \u2b50 = \u2666. That might be useful later.\n\nNow, the question is asking for \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6. We know that \u2b50 is 2\u25c6, so substituting that in: 2\u25c6 \u00d7 \u25c6. Multiplying those together gives 2\u25c6\u00b2, which is 2\u25c6 squared.\n\nBut the problem says to express the answer in terms of the given symbols. Since we don't have a symbol for \u25c6 squared, I might need to find a way to express that in terms of other symbols.\n\nLooking back at the equations, we have \u2b50 = 2\u25c6 and \u25b2 = 3\u25c6. Maybe we can express \u25c6 in terms of \u2b50 or \u25b2.\n\nFrom \u2b50 = 2\u25c6, solving for \u25c6 gives \u25c6 = \u2b50 / 2.\n\nSo, substituting that into 2\u25c6\u00b2: 2*(\u2b50 / 2)\u00b2. Let's calculate that.\n\nFirst, square (\u2b50 / 2): (\u2b50 / 2)\u00b2 = \u2b50\u00b2 / 4.\n\nThen multiply by 2: 2*(\u2b50\u00b2 / 4) = (2/4)*\u2b50\u00b2 = (1/2)*\u2b50\u00b2.\n\nSo, \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 equals (1/2)\u2b50\u00b2.\n\nBut wait, is that the simplest form? Let me see if I can express it differently.\n\nAlternatively, since \u25b2 = 3\u25c6 and \u2b50 = 2\u25c6, perhaps we can relate \u2b50 to \u25b2.\n\nFrom \u25b2 = 3\u25c6 and \u2b50 = 2\u25c6, we can solve for \u25c6 in terms of \u25b2: \u25c6 = \u25b2 / 3.\n\nSubstituting that into \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6: \u2b50 \u00d7 (\u25b2 / 3).\n\nBut we know \u2b50 is 2\u25c6, so substituting that: 2\u25c6 \u00d7 (\u25b2 / 3).\n\nBut \u25c6 is \u25b2 / 3, so: 2*(\u25b2 / 3) \u00d7 (\u25b2 / 3) = (2/3)*(\u25b2\u00b2 / 3) = (2/9)\u25b2\u00b2.\n\nHmm, that's another expression, but it's in terms of \u25b2 squared. The question asks to express the answer in terms of the given symbols, which are \u2b50, \u25c6, \u25b2, and \u2666. Since we have expressions connecting these symbols, perhaps either form is acceptable.\n\nBut let's see if there's a way to express it without squaring. Alternatively, maybe using the value of \u2666, which is 2\u25c6. Since \u2b50 = 2\u25c6 and \u2666 = 2\u25c6, then \u2b50 = \u2666.\n\nSo, \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = \u2666 \u00d7 \u25c6. But from equation 3, \u2666 = 2\u25c6, so substituting that: 2\u25c6 \u00d7 \u25c6 = 2\u25c6\u00b2.\n\nWait, that's the same as before. So, regardless of how I approach it, I end up with 2\u25c6 squared or (1/2)\u2b50 squared or (2/9)\u25b2 squared.\n\nBut the problem says to express the answer in terms of the given symbols. So, which form is preferred? The question doesn't specify, but usually, in these systems, using the fewest substitutions is best.\n\nSince we have \u2b50 = 2\u25c6, and we can express \u25c6 in terms of \u2b50, which is \u25c6 = \u2b50 / 2, then \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = \u2b50 \u00d7 (\u2b50 / 2) = (\u2b50\u00b2) / 2.\n\nAlternatively, since we have \u25b2 = 3\u25c6, and \u2b50 = 2\u25c6, so \u2b50 = (2/3)\u25b2. Then, \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = (2/3)\u25b2 \u00d7 (\u25b2 / 3) = (2/9)\u25b2\u00b2.\n\nBut perhaps the simplest in terms of given symbols is to express it as (1/2)\u2b50\u00b2 or 2\u25c6\u00b2.\n\nWait, let me check equation 3 again: \u25b2 - \u25c6 = \u2666. We found that \u25b2 = 3\u25c6 and \u2666 = 2\u25c6. So, indeed, 3\u25c6 - \u25c6 = 2\u25c6, which checks out.\n\nAlso, equation 1: \u2b50 + \u25c6 = \u25b2, which is 2\u25c6 + \u25c6 = 3\u25c6, correct.\n\nEquation 2: \u25c6 + \u25c6 = \u2b50, which is 2\u25c6 = \u2b50, correct.\n\nSo, all equations are consistent.\n\nNow, going back to \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6. We have two expressions:\n\n1. \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = 2\u25c6\u00b2\n2. \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = (1/2)\u2b50\u00b2\n\nWhich one is better? The problem says to express it in terms of the given symbols. Since both forms use the given symbols, but perhaps the first form uses fewer substitutions.\n\nAlternatively, since we have \u2b50 = 2\u25c6, and we can express \u25c6 as (1/2)\u2b50, then \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = \u2b50 \u00d7 (1/2)\u2b50 = (1/2)\u2b50\u00b2.\n\nSimilarly, since \u25b2 = 3\u25c6, and \u2b50 = (2/3)\u25b2, then \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = (2/3)\u25b2 \u00d7 (\u25b2 / 3) = (2/9)\u25b2\u00b2.\n\nBut I think the simplest expression is either 2\u25c6\u00b2 or (1/2)\u2b50\u00b2, as they directly use the given symbols without introducing new operations beyond squaring.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can express it in terms of \u2666, since we know \u2666 = 2\u25c6. So, 2\u25c6\u00b2 = 2*(\u25c6\u00b2) = 2*( (\u2666)\u00b2 / (2\u00b2) ) since \u2666 = 2\u25c6. Wait, that might complicate things more.\n\nAlternatively, since \u2b50 = 2\u25c6, then \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = 2\u25c6 \u00d7 \u25c6 = 2\u25c6\u00b2.\n\nYes, that seems straightforward.\n\nSo, the answer is 2\u25c6\u00b2, or in terms of \u2b50, it's (1/2)\u2b50\u00b2.\n\nBut the question says to express it in terms of the given symbols. So, using the symbols as they are, without introducing fractions or coefficients unless necessary.\n\nWait, but in the given system, we have operations like addition, subtraction, and multiplication. Since we're dealing with multiplication, and we have the symbols, perhaps 2\u25c6\u00b2 is acceptable, as it's in terms of the given symbols.\n\nAlternatively, since we can express \u25c6 in terms of \u2b50, which is \u25c6 = \u2b50 / 2, then \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = \u2b50 \u00d7 (\u2b50 / 2) = (\u2b50\u00b2) / 2.\n\nSo, both forms are correct, but perhaps (1/2)\u2b50\u00b2 is more concise.\n\nHowever, the problem might prefer to have it in terms of the original symbols without fractions. So, 2\u25c6\u00b2 might be better.\n\nBut let me see if there's another way. Since we have \u2b50 = 2\u25c6, and we need to find \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6, which is 2\u25c6 \u00d7 \u25c6 = 2\u25c6\u00b2.\n\nAlternatively, from equation 1: \u2b50 + \u25c6 = \u25b2, and equation 2: 2\u25c6 = \u2b50, so substituting in equation 1: 2\u25c6 + \u25c6 = 3\u25c6 = \u25b2.\n\nFrom equation 3: \u25b2 - \u25c6 = \u2666, so 3\u25c6 - \u25c6 = 2\u25c6 = \u2666.\n\nSo, we have:\n\n- \u2b50 = 2\u25c6\n- \u25b2 = 3\u25c6\n- \u2666 = 2\u25c6\n\nNow, to find \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6, which is 2\u25c6 \u00d7 \u25c6 = 2\u25c6\u00b2.\n\nBut perhaps we can express \u25c6\u00b2 in terms of other symbols. Since \u25b2 = 3\u25c6, then \u25c6 = \u25b2 / 3.\n\nSo, \u25c6\u00b2 = (\u25b2 / 3)\u00b2 = \u25b2\u00b2 / 9.\n\nTherefore, 2\u25c6\u00b2 = 2*(\u25b2\u00b2 / 9) = (2/9)\u25b2\u00b2.\n\nSo, another way to write it is (2/9)\u25b2\u00b2.\n\nBut again, the problem is to express it in terms of the given symbols. So, using the given symbols, 2\u25c6\u00b2 is acceptable, as is (1/2)\u2b50\u00b2 or (2/9)\u25b2\u00b2.\n\nBut perhaps the simplest is 2\u25c6\u00b2.\n\nAlternatively, let's see if we can find a value that's consistent across all symbols.\n\nSince we have:\n\n- \u2b50 = 2\u25c6\n- \u25b2 = 3\u25c6\n- \u2666 = 2\u25c6\n\nSo, all in terms of \u25c6, which suggests that the system is consistent but we don't have a numerical value for \u25c6. Therefore, we can only express the result in terms of the symbols.\n\nThus, the answer is either 2\u25c6\u00b2, (1/2)\u2b50\u00b2, or (2/9)\u25b2\u00b2.\n\nBut the question is asking for \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6, so in terms of the given symbols, the most direct expression is 2\u25c6\u00b2.\n\nAlternatively, since we have \u2b50 = 2\u25c6, we can write it as (1/2)\u2b50\u00b2.\n\nBut let's see which one is more precise.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem expects us to substitute as much as possible. So, since we have \u2b50 = 2\u25c6, then \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = 2\u25c6 \u00d7 \u25c6 = 2\u25c6\u00b2.\n\nBut since we can express \u25c6 in terms of \u2b50, which is \u25c6 = \u2b50 / 2, then substituting back: 2*(\u2b50 / 2)\u00b2 = 2*(\u2b50\u00b2 / 4) = \u2b50\u00b2 / 2.\n\nSo, both expressions are correct, but perhaps the problem expects the answer in terms of the given symbols without fractions, so 2\u25c6\u00b2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is simply 2\u25c6\u00b2.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the equations to make sure I haven't missed anything.\n\nEquation 1: \u2b50 + \u25c6 = \u25b2 \u2192 2\u25c6 + \u25c6 = 3\u25c6 = \u25b2.\n\nEquation 2: \u25c6 + \u25c6 = \u2b50 \u2192 2\u25c6 = \u2b50.\n\nEquation 3: \u25b2 - \u25c6 = \u2666 \u2192 3\u25c6 - \u25c6 = 2\u25c6 = \u2666.\n\nSo, all equations are consistent.\n\nNow, the question is to find \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6. From equation 2, \u2b50 = 2\u25c6, so \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = 2\u25c6 \u00d7 \u25c6 = 2\u25c6\u00b2.\n\nAlternatively, since we have \u25b2 = 3\u25c6, and \u2b50 = 2\u25c6, then \u2b50 = (2/3)\u25b2.\n\nSo, \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = (2/3)\u25b2 \u00d7 \u25c6.\n\nBut \u25c6 = \u25b2 / 3, so substituting: (2/3)\u25b2 \u00d7 (\u25b2 / 3) = (2/9)\u25b2\u00b2.\n\nSo, both expressions are valid, but perhaps the problem expects the answer in terms of the given symbols without fractions, so 2\u25c6\u00b2.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that the problem might accept any of these forms, but perhaps the most straightforward is 2\u25c6\u00b2.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Since we have to express it in terms of the given symbols, and the given symbols are \u2b50, \u25c6, \u25b2, and \u2666. So, 2\u25c6\u00b2 uses only \u25c6, which is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, using other symbols, but 2\u25c6\u00b2 is the most direct.\n\nSo, I think the answer is 2\u25c6\u00b2.\n</think>\n\n\u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = 2\u25c6\u00b2\n\nDONE."

Express your answer in terms of the given symbols. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I've got this problem here with some symbols and equations, and I need to figure out what \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 equals. Let me start by writing down all the given equations to make sure I have everything clear.\n\nThe first equation is:\n\u2b50 + \u25c6 = \u25b2\n\nThe second equation is:\n\u25c6 + \u25c6 = \u2b50\n\nThe third equation is:\n\u25b2 - \u25c6 = \u2666\n\nAnd the fourth equation is:\n\u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = ?\n\nOkay, so I have four equations with four unknowns: \u2b50, \u25c6, \u25b2, and \u2666. Since each symbol represents a consistent value, I should be able to solve for each one step by step.\n\nLet me label the equations for clarity:\n1. \u2b50 + \u25c6 = \u25b2\n2. \u25c6 + \u25c6 = \u2b50\n3. \u25b2 - \u25c6 = \u2666\n4. \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = ?\n\nStarting with equation 2: \u25c6 + \u25c6 = \u2b50. That simplifies to 2 \u00d7 \u25c6 = \u2b50. So, I can express \u2b50 in terms of \u25c6. Let me write that down:\n\u2b50 = 2 \u00d7 \u25c6\n\nNow, equation 1 is \u2b50 + \u25c6 = \u25b2. Since I know that \u2b50 is 2 \u00d7 \u25c6, I can substitute that into equation 1:\n2 \u00d7 \u25c6 + \u25c6 = \u25b2\n\nAdding those together:\n3 \u00d7 \u25c6 = \u25b2\n\nSo, \u25b2 = 3 \u00d7 \u25c6. Got it. Now, equation 3 is \u25b2 - \u25c6 = \u2666. Since \u25b2 is 3 \u00d7 \u25c6, I can substitute that in:\n3 \u00d7 \u25c6 - \u25c6 = \u2666\n\nSubtracting those:\n2 \u00d7 \u25c6 = \u2666\n\nSo, \u2666 is equal to 2 \u00d7 \u25c6. Interesting, so both \u2b50 and \u2666 are equal to 2 \u00d7 \u25c6. Wait, no, let me double-check. \u2b50 is 2 \u00d7 \u25c6, and \u2666 is also 2 \u00d7 \u25c6. So, they are equal? That seems a bit odd, but mathematically, it checks out.\n\nNow, the question is asking for \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6. Since I know \u2b50 = 2 \u00d7 \u25c6, I can substitute that into the expression:\n(2 \u00d7 \u25c6) \u00d7 \u25c6\n\nMultiplying those together:\n2 \u00d7 \u25c6 \u00d7 \u25c6 = 2 \u00d7 (\u25c6 \u00d7 \u25c6)\n\nSo, \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 equals 2 \u00d7 (\u25c6 squared). But I need to express the answer in terms of the given symbols, so I should write it using symbols instead of numbers. Since \u25c6 is a symbol, (\u25c6)^2 is \u25c6 squared, or \u25c6\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = 2 \u00d7 \u25c6\u00b2.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes here. Let's go through the steps again.\n\nFrom equation 2: \u25c6 + \u25c6 = \u2b50 \u2192 2\u25c6 = \u2b50\nFrom equation 1: \u2b50 + \u25c6 = \u25b2 \u2192 2\u25c6 + \u25c6 = 3\u25c6 = \u25b2\nFrom equation 3: \u25b2 - \u25c6 = \u2666 \u2192 3\u25c6 - \u25c6 = 2\u25c6 = \u2666\nSo, \u2b50 = 2\u25c6 and \u2666 = 2\u25c6, which means \u2b50 = \u2666. That's interesting, but mathematically sound.\n\nNow, for \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6:\n\u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = (2\u25c6) \u00d7 \u25c6 = 2\u25c6 \u00d7 \u25c6 = 2\u25c6\u00b2\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the answer is 2\u25c6 squared, or 2\u25c6\u00b2.\n\nI think that's it. All the substitutions check out, and the algebra seems consistent.\n</think>\n\nThe value of \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 is found by substituting the known relationships between the symbols. Since \u2b50 equals 2\u25c6 and \u25c6 is a common factor, the product simplifies to 2 times \u25c6 squared.\n\n**Answer:** \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = 2\u25c6\u00b2\n\nDONE."

Express your answer in terms of the given symbols. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this problem here with some symbols and equations, and I need to figure out what \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 equals. Let me try to break it down step by step. Okay, first, let's list out all the equations given:\n\n1. \u2b50 + \u25c6 = \u25b2\n2. \u25c6 + \u25c6 = \u2b50\n3. \u25b2 - \u25c6 = \u2666\n4. \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = ?\n\nEach symbol represents a consistent value, so I need to find relationships between them. Maybe I can express some symbols in terms of others and substitute them into the equations.\n\nStarting with equation 2: \u25c6 + \u25c6 = \u2b50. That simplifies to 2 \u25c6 = \u2b50, so I can say that \u2b50 is twice the value of \u25c6. Let me write that down:\n\n\u2b50 = 2 \u25c6\n\nOkay, so now I know that \u2b50 is 2 times \u25c6. Let's see if I can use this in equation 1. Equation 1 is \u2b50 + \u25c6 = \u25b2. Substituting \u2b50 with 2 \u25c6, we get:\n\n2 \u25c6 + \u25c6 = \u25b2\n\nThat's 3 \u25c6 = \u25b2. So \u25b2 is three times \u25c6. I'll note that:\n\n\u25b2 = 3 \u25c6\n\nGreat, now I have expressions for both \u2b50 and \u25b2 in terms of \u25c6. Let's move to equation 3: \u25b2 - \u25c6 = \u2666. Since I know \u25b2 is 3 \u25c6, I can substitute that in:\n\n3 \u25c6 - \u25c6 = \u2666\n\nThat simplifies to 2 \u25c6 = \u2666. So \u2666 is also twice \u25c6. Noted:\n\n\u2666 = 2 \u25c6\n\nNow, I have all symbols expressed in terms of \u25c6. Let me recap:\n\n- \u2b50 = 2 \u25c6\n- \u25b2 = 3 \u25c6\n- \u2666 = 2 \u25c6\n\nSo, everything is related to \u25c6. Now, the question is asking for \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6. Let's compute that:\n\n\u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = (2 \u25c6) \u00d7 \u25c6\n\nMultiplying these together gives:\n\n2 \u25c6 \u00d7 \u25c6 = 2 \u25c6\u00b2\n\nHmm, so \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 equals 2 times \u25c6 squared. But the problem asks for the answer in terms of the given symbols, not in terms of numbers or variables. So I need to express this result using the symbols themselves.\n\nSince all symbols are expressed in terms of \u25c6, and I need to express the answer also in terms of the symbols, maybe I can relate it back to one of the symbols. Let's see.\n\nFrom equation 2, we have \u2b50 = 2 \u25c6, which implies that \u25c6 = \u2b50 / 2. Let me substitute this into the expression for \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6:\n\n\u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = 2 \u25c6\u00b2\n\nBut if \u25c6 = \u2b50 / 2, then substituting:\n\n2 (\u2b50 / 2)\u00b2 = 2 (\u2b50\u00b2 / 4) = (2 \u00d7 \u2b50\u00b2) / 4 = \u2b50\u00b2 / 2\n\nWait, that's interesting. So \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 equals \u2b50\u00b2 divided by 2. But is that helpful? Let me think differently.\n\nAlternatively, since I know that \u25b2 = 3 \u25c6, and I have expressions for \u25b2 and \u2666 in terms of \u25c6, maybe I can find a relationship that doesn't involve \u25c6 directly. Let's see.\n\nFrom equation 1: \u2b50 + \u25c6 = \u25b2, and we know that \u2b50 = 2 \u25c6, so:\n\n2 \u25c6 + \u25c6 = 3 \u25c6 = \u25b2\n\nAnd from equation 3: \u25b2 - \u25c6 = \u2666, so:\n\n3 \u25c6 - \u25c6 = 2 \u25c6 = \u2666\n\nSo, we have \u25b2 = 3 \u25c6 and \u2666 = 2 \u25c6. Therefore, both \u25b2 and \u2666 are multiples of \u25c6. Now, let's see if we can express everything in terms of each other.\n\nWait, if I have \u2b50 = 2 \u25c6 and \u25b2 = 3 \u25c6, then maybe I can relate \u2b50 and \u25b2. For example, \u2b50 is two-thirds of \u25b2 because 2 \u25c6 = (2/3) \u00d7 3 \u25c6 = (2/3) \u00d7 \u25b2. So, \u2b50 = (2/3) \u25b2.\n\nSimilarly, since \u2666 = 2 \u25c6, and \u25b2 = 3 \u25c6, then \u2666 = (2/3) \u25b2. So, \u2666 is two-thirds of \u25b2.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that helps directly with finding \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6. Let me try another approach.\n\nI have \u2b50 = 2 \u25c6, so maybe I can express \u25c6 in terms of \u2b50:\n\n\u25c6 = \u2b50 / 2\n\nThen, substituting into \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6:\n\n\u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = \u2b50 \u00d7 (\u2b50 / 2) = (\u2b50\u00b2) / 2\n\nSo, that's the same result as before. But the problem asks for the answer in terms of the given symbols, not in terms of numbers or fractions. So, I need to find an expression using the symbols themselves, not substituting numerical values.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I can express \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 in terms of other symbols. Let's see.\n\nFrom equation 1: \u2b50 + \u25c6 = \u25b2. So, if I solve for \u25c6, I get \u25c6 = \u25b2 - \u2b50.\n\nSubstituting into equation 2: \u25c6 + \u25c6 = \u2b50, which becomes (\u25b2 - \u2b50) + (\u25b2 - \u2b50) = \u2b50.\n\nSimplifying: 2(\u25b2 - \u2b50) = \u2b50 \u21d2 2\u25b2 - 2\u2b50 = \u2b50 \u21d2 2\u25b2 = 3\u2b50 \u21d2 \u25b2 = (3/2)\u2b50\n\nBut earlier, we had \u25b2 = 3 \u25c6, so combining these:\n\n3 \u25c6 = (3/2)\u2b50 \u21d2 3 \u25c6 = (3/2)(2 \u25c6) \u21d2 3 \u25c6 = 3 \u25c6, which is consistent.\n\nHmm, maybe I can relate other symbols. From equation 3: \u25b2 - \u25c6 = \u2666. Since \u25b2 = 3 \u25c6, then:\n\n3 \u25c6 - \u25c6 = 2 \u25c6 = \u2666\n\nSo, \u2666 = 2 \u25c6\n\nNow, let's see if I can express everything in terms of \u2b50.\n\nFrom \u2b50 = 2 \u25c6, we have \u25c6 = \u2b50 / 2.\n\nThen, \u2666 = 2 \u25c6 = 2 (\u2b50 / 2) = \u2b50\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, \u2666 = \u2b50\n\nThat simplifies things. So, \u2666 equals \u2b50.\n\nNow, going back to equation 3: \u25b2 - \u25c6 = \u2666, and since \u2666 = \u2b50, we have:\n\n\u25b2 - \u25c6 = \u2b50\n\nBut from equation 1: \u2b50 + \u25c6 = \u25b2, so:\n\n\u25b2 = \u2b50 + \u25c6\n\nSubstituting into the previous equation:\n\n(\u2b50 + \u25c6) - \u25c6 = \u2b50 \u21d2 \u2b50 = \u2b50\n\nWhich is always true, so it doesn't provide new information.\n\nBut the key point is that \u2666 = \u2b50, which might help in expressing the final result.\n\nSo, we have:\n\n- \u2b50 = 2 \u25c6\n- \u25b2 = 3 \u25c6\n- \u2666 = \u2b50\n\nNow, let's compute \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6:\n\n\u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = (2 \u25c6) \u00d7 \u25c6 = 2 \u25c6\u00b2\n\nBut I need to express this in terms of the given symbols, not in terms of \u25c6. Since I have expressions for other symbols in terms of \u25c6, maybe I can express \u25c6 in terms of \u2b50 or another symbol.\n\nFrom \u2b50 = 2 \u25c6, we have \u25c6 = \u2b50 / 2\n\nSo, substituting into 2 \u25c6\u00b2:\n\n2 (\u2b50 / 2)\u00b2 = 2 (\u2b50\u00b2 / 4) = (2 \u00d7 \u2b50\u00b2) / 4 = \u2b50\u00b2 / 2\n\nSo, \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = \u2b50\u00b2 / 2\n\nAlternatively, since \u2666 = \u2b50, maybe I can express this in terms of \u2666.\n\nSince \u2666 = \u2b50, then \u2b50 = \u2666\n\nSo, substituting into \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6:\n\n\u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = \u2666 \u00d7 \u25c6\n\nBut I still have \u25c6 in there. Let me see if I can express \u25c6 in terms of \u2666.\n\nFrom earlier, we have:\n\nFrom equation 2: 2 \u25c6 = \u2b50 = \u2666, so 2 \u25c6 = \u2666 \u21d2 \u25c6 = \u2666 / 2\n\nSo, substituting into \u2666 \u00d7 \u25c6:\n\n\u2666 \u00d7 (\u2666 / 2) = (\u2666\u00b2) / 2\n\nSo, \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = (\u2666\u00b2) / 2\n\nBut the problem is to express the answer in terms of the given symbols, which are \u2b50, \u25c6, \u25b2, and \u2666. So, both \u2b50\u00b2 / 2 and \u2666\u00b2 / 2 are acceptable, but perhaps the first expression is better because it directly relates to the original symbols.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can find another relationship. Let's think differently.\n\nFrom equation 1: \u2b50 + \u25c6 = \u25b2\n\nFrom equation 2: 2 \u25c6 = \u2b50\n\nSo, substituting into equation 1: 2 \u25c6 + \u25c6 = 3 \u25c6 = \u25b2 \u21d2 \u25b2 = 3 \u25c6\n\nFrom equation 3: \u25b2 - \u25c6 = \u2666 \u21d2 3 \u25c6 - \u25c6 = 2 \u25c6 = \u2666 \u21d2 \u2666 = 2 \u25c6\n\nSo, we have:\n\n- \u2b50 = 2 \u25c6\n- \u25b2 = 3 \u25c6\n- \u2666 = 2 \u25c6\n\nSo, all symbols are multiples of \u25c6. Let's express everything in terms of \u25c6:\n\n- \u2b50 = 2 \u25c6\n- \u25b2 = 3 \u25c6\n- \u2666 = 2 \u25c6\n\nNow, the product \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 is:\n\n\u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = (2 \u25c6) \u00d7 \u25c6 = 2 \u25c6\u00b2\n\nBut I need to express this in terms of the symbols without using numbers or fractions. Since all symbols are related to \u25c6, perhaps I can write 2 \u25c6\u00b2 in terms of other symbols.\n\nFrom equation 2: 2 \u25c6 = \u2b50 \u21d2 \u25c6 = \u2b50 / 2\n\nSo, substituting into 2 \u25c6\u00b2:\n\n2 (\u2b50 / 2)\u00b2 = 2 (\u2b50\u00b2 / 4) = \u2b50\u00b2 / 2\n\nSo, \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = \u2b50\u00b2 / 2\n\nAlternatively, since \u2666 = 2 \u25c6, then \u25c6 = \u2666 / 2\n\nSubstituting into 2 \u25c6\u00b2:\n\n2 (\u2666 / 2)\u00b2 = 2 (\u2666\u00b2 / 4) = \u2666\u00b2 / 2\n\nSo, another way to write it is \u2666\u00b2 / 2\n\nBut the problem asks for the answer in terms of the given symbols, so both expressions are valid. However, the first one, \u2b50\u00b2 / 2, seems more straightforward because it uses the symbols directly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express it in terms of \u25b2, since \u25b2 is 3 \u25c6.\n\nFrom \u25b2 = 3 \u25c6 \u21d2 \u25c6 = \u25b2 / 3\n\nSubstituting into 2 \u25c6\u00b2:\n\n2 (\u25b2 / 3)\u00b2 = 2 (\u25b2\u00b2 / 9) = (2 \u25b2\u00b2) / 9\n\nSo, another expression is (2 \u25b2\u00b2) / 9\n\nBut again, the problem is to express it in terms of the given symbols, and all these expressions are correct, but perhaps the simplest is \u2b50\u00b2 / 2.\n\nWait, let me check if I made any mistakes. Let me recap:\n\nFrom equation 2: 2 \u25c6 = \u2b50 \u21d2 \u2b50 = 2 \u25c6\n\nFrom equation 1: 3 \u25c6 = \u25b2 \u21d2 \u25b2 = 3 \u25c6\n\nFrom equation 3: 2 \u25c6 = \u2666 \u21d2 \u2666 = 2 \u25c6\n\nSo, all symbols are expressed in terms of \u25c6. Now, computing \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6:\n\n\u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = (2 \u25c6) \u00d7 \u25c6 = 2 \u25c6\u00b2\n\nBut to express this in terms of the symbols, I can relate \u25c6 to \u2b50 or to \u2666.\n\nSince \u2b50 = 2 \u25c6 \u21d2 \u25c6 = \u2b50 / 2\n\nSo, substituting:\n\n2 (\u2b50 / 2)\u00b2 = 2 (\u2b50\u00b2 / 4) = \u2b50\u00b2 / 2\n\nAlternatively, since \u2666 = 2 \u25c6 \u21d2 \u25c6 = \u2666 / 2\n\nSo, substituting:\n\n2 (\u2666 / 2)\u00b2 = 2 (\u2666\u00b2 / 4) = \u2666\u00b2 / 2\n\nEither way, the answer is half of the square of one of the symbols.\n\nBut since the problem is to express it in terms of the given symbols, and all symbols are related, both expressions are acceptable. However, the problem may expect an expression in terms of one of the symbols, perhaps the first one, \u2b50\u00b2 / 2.\n\nAlternatively, since we have \u25b2 = 3 \u25c6, we can write:\n\n2 \u25c6\u00b2 = (2/9) \u25b2\u00b2\n\nBut that might not be necessary unless specified.\n\nI think the most straightforward expression is \u2b50\u00b2 / 2 because it directly uses the symbol we're multiplying, which is \u2b50.\n\nSo, after going through all these steps, I conclude that \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 equals half of \u2b50 squared, or in symbols, (\u2b50\u00b2) / 2.\n</think>\n\nTo solve for \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6, we start by expressing all symbols in terms of \u25c6:\n\n- From equation 2: 2 \u25c6 = \u2b50 \u21d2 \u2b50 = 2 \u25c6\n- From equation 1: 3 \u25c6 = \u25b2 \u21d2 \u25b2 = 3 \u25c6\n- From equation 3: 2 \u25c6 = \u2666 \u21d2 \u2666 = 2 \u25c6\n\nThen, compute \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6:\n\n\u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = (2 \u25c6) \u00d7 \u25c6 = 2 \u25c6\u00b2\n\nExpressing \u25c6 in terms of \u2b50:\n\n\u25c6 = \u2b50 / 2\n\nSubstituting back:\n\n2 (\u2b50 / 2)\u00b2 = 2 (\u2b50\u00b2 / 4) = \u2b50\u00b2 / 2\n\nThus, \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 equals half of \u2b50 squared.\n\n**Answer:** \u2b50 \u00d7 \u25c6 = (\u2b50\u00b2) / 2\n\nDONE."
