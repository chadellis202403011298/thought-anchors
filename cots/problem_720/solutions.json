Based on historical data, if today is Sunny, then tomorrow has a 70% chance of being Sunny, a 20% chance of being Cloudy, and a 10% chance of being Rainy. If today is Cloudy, then tomorrow has a 50% chance of being Cloudy, a 30% chance of being Sunny, and a 20% chance of being Rainy. If today is Rainy, then tomorrow has a 40% chance of being Rainy, a 40% chance of being Cloudy, and a 20% chance of being Sunny. If today is Sunny, what is the probability that it will be Rainy exactly 2 days from now? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I've got this weather station problem to solve. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question is about finding the probability that it will be Rainy exactly two days from today, given that today is Sunny. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the transition probabilities between the different weather categories. The problem gives me the probabilities for tomorrow based on today's weather. Specifically:\n\n- **If today is Sunny**:\n  - Tomorrow: 70% Sunny, 20% Cloudy, 10% Rainy.\n  \n- **If today is Cloudy**:\n  - Tomorrow: 50% Cloudy, 30% Sunny, 20% Rainy.\n  \n- **If today is Rainy**:\n  - Tomorrow: 40% Rainy, 40% Cloudy, 20% Sunny.\n\nSo, I'm starting from today, which is Sunny, and I need to find the probability of Rainy exactly two days from now. That means I need to consider the weather conditions for today, tomorrow, and the day after tomorrow. Since today is Sunny, I can use the given probabilities to find tomorrow's weather, and then again, use those probabilities to find the day after tomorrow's weather.\n\nLet me structure this:\n\n1. **Today (Day 0)**: Sunny\n2. **Tomorrow (Day 1)**: Possible weathers and their probabilities\n3. **Day after tomorrow (Day 2)**: Possible weathers and their probabilities, considering Day 1's weather\n\nSince we're dealing with two days from today, I'll have to consider all possible paths that lead to Rainy on Day 2. That is, for each possible weather on Day 1, I'll calculate the probability of transitioning from Day 1 to Day 2, and then sum them up weighted by the probabilities from Day 0 to Day 1.\n\nLet me write down the transitions:\n\n- From Sunny (Day 0) to tomorrow (Day 1):\n  - 70% Sunny\n  - 20% Cloudy\n  - 10% Rainy\n\n- From each of these, to Day 2:\n  - If Day 1 is Sunny:\n    - 70% Sunny\n    - 20% Cloudy\n    - 10% Rainy\n  - If Day 1 is Cloudy:\n    - 30% Sunny\n    - 20% Rainy\n    - 40% Cloudy\n  - If Day 1 is Rainy:\n    - 20% Sunny\n    - 40% Rainy\n    - 40% Cloudy\n\nWait, hold on. Actually, for Day 1, if today is Sunny, tomorrow can be Sunny, Cloudy, or Rainy with the given probabilities. Then, for each of these possibilities, I need to find the probability of Rainy on Day 2.\n\nSo, to compute the total probability, I should consider each possible Day 1 weather and then, for each, the probability of Rainy on Day 2, multiplied by the probability of that Day 1 weather.\n\nLet me formalize this:\n\nLet P(Rainy on Day 2) = P(Rainy on Day 2 | Day 1 is Sunny) * P(Sunny on Day 1) + P(Rainy on Day 2 | Day 1 is Cloudy) * P(Cloudy on Day 1) + P(Rainy on Day 2 | Day 1 is Rainy) * P(Rainy on Day 1)\n\nBut wait, no, actually, since today is Sunny, the Day 1 probabilities are conditional on today being Sunny. So, more accurately:\n\nP(Rainy on Day 2) = P(Rainy on Day 2 | Day 1 is Sunny) * P(Sunny on Day 1) + P(Rainy on Day 2 | Day 1 is Cloudy) * P(Cloudy on Day 1) + P(Rainy on Day 2 | Day 1 is Rainy) * P(Rainy on Day 1)\n\nBut since today is Sunny, the initial probabilities for Day 1 are based on today being Sunny. So:\n\nP(Rainy on Day 2) = P(Rainy on Day 2 | Day 1 is Sunny) * 0.7 + P(Rainy on Day 2 | Day 1 is Cloudy) * 0.2 + P(Rainy on Day 2 | Day 1 is Rainy) * 0.1\n\nWait, hold on. No, that's not quite right. Because from today being Sunny, tomorrow can be Sunny, Cloudy, or Rainy. So, to get the probability for Day 2, I need to consider all possible paths:\n\n1. Today: Sunny\n   - Tomorrow: Sunny (70%)\n     - Day after: Sunny (70%), Cloudy (20%), Rainy (10%)\n   - Tomorrow: Cloudy (20%)\n     - Day after: Cloudy (40%), Sunny (30%), Rainy (20%)\n   - Tomorrow: Rainy (10%)\n     - Day after: Rainy (40%), Cloudy (40%), Sunny (20%)\n\nTherefore, to find the total probability of Rainy on Day 2, I need to consider each possible tomorrow's weather and then the probability of Rainy on Day 2 given that tomorrow's weather.\n\nSo, mathematically:\n\nP(Rainy on Day 2) = P(Rainy on Day 2 | Today is Sunny) = P(Today is Sunny) * [P(Rainy on Day 2 | Tomorrow is Sunny) * P(Tomorrow is Sunny) + P(Rainy on Day 2 | Tomorrow is Cloudy) * P(Tomorrow is Cloudy) + P(Rainy on Day 2 | Tomorrow is Rainy) * P(Tomorrow is Rainy)]\n\nBut since we're given that today is Sunny, it's:\n\nP(Rainy on Day 2) = P(Rainy on Day 2 | Tomorrow is Sunny) * P(Tomorrow is Sunny | Today is Sunny) + P(Rainy on Day 2 | Tomorrow is Cloudy) * P(Tomorrow is Cloudy | Today is Sunny) + P(Rainy on Day 2 | Tomorrow is Rainy) * P(Tomorrow is Rainy | Today is Sunny)\n\nWhich translates to:\n\n= (0.10) * 0.70 + (0.20) * 0.20 + (0.40) * 0.10\n\nWait, let me check. No, that's not correct. Because the transition probabilities are from tomorrow to Day 2, not from today to tomorrow.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the notation. Let me clarify.\n\nGiven that today is Sunny, tomorrow's probabilities are:\n\n- Sunny: 70%\n- Cloudy: 20%\n- Rainy: 10%\n\nThen, for each of these tomorrow's weather, we have the probabilities for Day 2.\n\nSo, P(Rainy on Day 2) is the sum over all possible tomorrow's weather of [P(Tomorrow's weather) * P(Rainy on Day 2 | Tomorrow's weather)]\n\nSo, it's:\n\nP(Rainy on Day 2) = P(Rainy on Day 2 | Tomorrow is Sunny) * P(Tomorrow is Sunny) + P(Rainy on Day 2 | Tomorrow is Cloudy) * P(Tomorrow is Cloudy) + P(Rainy on Day 2 | Tomorrow is Rainy) * P(Tomorrow is Rainy)\n\nGiven that today is Sunny, the P(Tomorrow is Sunny) is 0.7, P(Cloudy) is 0.2, P(Rainy) is 0.1.\n\nNow, we need to find P(Rainy on Day 2 | Tomorrow is Sunny), etc.\n\nLooking back at the problem:\n\nIf today is Sunny, tomorrow has a 70% chance of being Sunny, 20% Cloudy, and 10% Rainy.\n\nSimilarly, if today is Cloudy, tomorrow's probabilities are given, and if today is Rainy, tomorrow's probabilities are given.\n\nBut for Day 2, the transitions are based on tomorrow's weather, not today's.\n\nSo, for each possible tomorrow's weather, we need to know the probability that tomorrow will be that weather, and then the probability that Day 2 will be Rainy given tomorrow's weather.\n\nSo, first, let's define:\n\n- P1(Sunny) = 0.7, P1(Cloudy) = 0.2, P1(Rainy) = 0.1 (tomorrow's probabilities given today is Sunny)\n\n- Then, for each of these, we need the transition probabilities to Day 2.\n\nBut the transition probabilities are given for tomorrow, based on today's weather. Wait, but for Day 2, we need the transition probabilities from tomorrow to Day 2, which are not given directly.\n\nWait, hold on. The problem states:\n\n\"If today is Sunny, then tomorrow has a 70% chance of being Sunny, 20% Cloudy, and 10% Rainy.\"\n\nSimilarly for other days.\n\nBut it doesn't directly give the transition probabilities from tomorrow to Day 2. Hmm, that's an issue. So, perhaps I need to assume that the same transition probabilities apply each day? Or is it that each day's weather is independent of previous days?\n\nWait, the problem says \"based on historical data,\" so I think we can assume that the transition probabilities are the same each day. So, for example, if tomorrow is Sunny, then the day after (Day 2) has the same transition probabilities as if today is Sunny.\n\nWait, but the problem says:\n\n\"If today is Sunny, then tomorrow has a 70% chance of being Sunny...\"\n\nSo, it's giving the transition probabilities from today to tomorrow, but not from tomorrow to Day 2. So, unless it's implied that the same transition probabilities apply each day, which is a common assumption in Markov chains, I think that's what we need to do here.\n\nSo, assuming that the same transition probabilities apply each day, then:\n\nIf tomorrow is Sunny, then Day 2 has 70% Sunny, 20% Cloudy, 10% Rainy.\n\nIf tomorrow is Cloudy, then Day 2 has 30% Sunny, 20% Rainy, 40% Cloudy.\n\nIf tomorrow is Rainy, then Day 2 has 20% Sunny, 40% Rainy, 40% Cloudy.\n\nSo, with that, we can compute P(Rainy on Day 2) given that today is Sunny.\n\nTherefore, P(Rainy on Day 2) = P(Rainy | Day 2, Tomorrow is Sunny) * P(Tomorrow is Sunny) + P(Rainy | Day 2, Tomorrow is Cloudy) * P(Tomorrow is Cloudy) + P(Rainy | Day 2, Tomorrow is Rainy) * P(Tomorrow is Rainy)\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n= (0.10) * 0.70 + (0.20) * 0.20 + (0.40) * 0.10\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst term: 0.10 * 0.70 = 0.07\n\nSecond term: 0.20 * 0.20 = 0.04\n\nThird term: 0.40 * 0.10 = 0.04\n\nAdding them up: 0.07 + 0.04 + 0.04 = 0.15\n\nSo, the probability is 15%.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should represent this as a tree.\n\nToday: Sunny (100%)\n\nTomorrow:\n\n- Sunny: 70%\n  - Day 2: Sunny:70%, Cloudy:20%, Rainy:10%\n- Cloudy:20%\n  - Day 2: Cloudy:40%, Sunny:30%, Rainy:20%\n- Rainy:10%\n  - Day 2: Rainy:40%, Cloudy:40%, Sunny:20%\n\nSo, the total probability of Rainy on Day 2 is the sum of Rainy on Day 2 from each branch.\n\nSo, compute each branch's contribution:\n\n1. Through Sunny tomorrow:\n\n   - P(Today Sunny) = 1.0\n\n   - P(Tomorrow Sunny) = 0.7\n\n   - P(Rainy on Day 2 | Tomorrow Sunny) = 0.10\n\n   So, contribution: 1.0 * 0.7 * 0.10 = 0.07\n\n2. Through Cloudy tomorrow:\n\n   - P(Today Sunny) = 1.0\n\n   - P(Tomorrow Cloudy) = 0.2\n\n   - P(Rainy on Day 2 | Tomorrow Cloudy) = 0.20\n\n   Contribution: 1.0 * 0.2 * 0.20 = 0.04\n\n3. Through Rainy tomorrow:\n\n   - P(Today Sunny) = 1.0\n\n   - P(Tomorrow Rainy) = 0.1\n\n   - P(Rainy on Day 2 | Tomorrow Rainy) = 0.40\n\n   Contribution: 1.0 * 0.1 * 0.40 = 0.04\n\nAdding these up: 0.07 + 0.04 + 0.04 = 0.15\n\nSo, yes, 15% is the correct probability.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is using matrices or transition matrices, but for two steps, this method is sufficient.\n\nSo, the probability that it will be Rainy exactly two days from now is 15%.\n</think>\n\nThe probability that it will be Rainy exactly two days from now is 15%.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Understand the Transition Probabilities:**\n   - From Sunny:\n     - Tomorrow: 70% Sunny, 20% Cloudy, 10% Rainy.\n   - From Cloudy:\n     - Tomorrow: 50% Cloudy, 30% Sunny, 20% Rainy.\n   - From Rainy:\n     - Tomorrow: 40% Rainy, 40% Cloudy, 20% Sunny.\n\n2. **Assume the Same Probabilities for Each Day:**\n   - Since the problem doesn't specify different probabilities for each day, assume the same transition probabilities apply each day.\n\n3. **Calculate the Probability for Each Path Leading to Rainy on Day 2:**\n   - **Path 1:** Today Sunny \u2192 Tomorrow Sunny \u2192 Day 2 Rainy\n     - Probability: 1.0 * 0.7 * 0.1 = 0.07\n   - **Path 2:** Today Sunny \u2192 Tomorrow Cloudy \u2192 Day 2 Rainy\n     - Probability: 1.0 * 0.2 * 0.2 = 0.04\n   - **Path 3:** Today Sunny \u2192 Tomorrow Rainy \u2192 Day 2 Rainy\n     - Probability: 1.0 * 0.1 * 0.4 = 0.04\n\n4. **Sum the Probabilities of All Paths Leading to Rainy on Day 2:**\n   - Total Probability = 0.07 + 0.04 + 0.04 = 0.15\n\n**Final Answer:** The probability that it will be Rainy exactly two days from now is 15%.\n\nDONE."

If today is Rainy, then tomorrow has a 40% chance of being Rainy, a 40% chance of being Cloudy, and a 20% chance of being Sunny. If today is Sunny, what is the probability that it will be Rainy exactly 2 days from now? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I've got this problem about a weather station categorizing days as Sunny, Cloudy, or Rainy. The question is asking for the probability that it will be Rainy exactly two days from today, given that today is Sunny. Hmm, okay. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the transition probabilities between the different weather categories. The problem gives me the probabilities for tomorrow based on today's weather:\n\n- If today is Sunny:\n  - Tomorrow: 70% Sunny, 20% Cloudy, 10% Rainy.\n- If today is Cloudy:\n  - Tomorrow: 30% Sunny, 50% Cloudy, 20% Rainy.\n- If today is Rainy:\n  - Tomorrow: 20% Sunny, 40% Cloudy, 40% Rainy.\n\nWait, so each day's weather depends only on the previous day's weather. That means this is a Markov process, right? No need to consider days beyond the immediate previous day.\n\nThe question is about two days from now. So, to find the probability that it's Rainy two days from now, I need to consider the weather tomorrow and the day after tomorrow.\n\nSince today is Sunny, I'll start with tomorrow. There's a 10% chance it'll be Rainy tomorrow. But that's just the first step. Now, I need to consider what happens the day after tomorrow, given that tomorrow could be Rainy or not.\n\nWait, no, actually, the problem says \"exactly two days from now.\" So, that would be the day after tomorrow. So, I think I need to calculate the probability that two days from today, it's Rainy. So, it's a two-step transition: today to tomorrow, and then tomorrow to two days from today.\n\nBut, since the weather on the day after tomorrow depends on tomorrow's weather, which depends on today's. So, I need to consider all possible paths from today to two days from now, and sum the probabilities where it's Rainy on the second day.\n\nSo, starting from today, which is Sunny. Let's denote the days as Day 0 (today), Day 1 (tomorrow), and Day 2 (two days from now).\n\nGiven that Day 0 is Sunny, I can compute the probabilities for Day 1 and Day 2.\n\nFirst, compute the probability that Day 1 is Rainy, which is 10%. Then, given that Day 1 is Rainy, compute the probability that Day 2 is Rainy. Alternatively, Day 1 could be Cloudy or Sunny, and we need to consider all possibilities.\n\nWait, but actually, since we're only concerned with Day 2 being Rainy, regardless of what Day 1 is, we can compute the total probability by considering all possible paths that lead to Rainy on Day 2.\n\nSo, the total probability P(Rainy on Day 2 | Sunny on Day 0) is equal to the sum over all possible weather conditions on Day 1 of P(Rainy on Day 2 | Weather on Day 1) * P(Weather on Day 1 | Sunny on Day 0).\n\nIn other words:\n\nP(Rainy on Day 2 | Sunny on Day 0) = P(Rainy on Day 2 | Rainy on Day 1) * P(Rainy on Day 1 | Sunny on Day 0) + P(Rainy on Day 2 | Cloudy on Day 1) * P(Cloudy on Day 1 | Sunny on Day 0) + P(Rainy on Day 2 | Sunny on Day 1) * P(Sunny on Day 1 | Sunny on Day 0)\n\nWait, but actually, the formula should be:\n\nP(Rainy on Day 2) = P(Rainy on Day 2 | Rainy on Day 1) * P(Rainy on Day 1) + P(Rainy on Day 2 | Cloudy on Day 1) * P(Cloudy on Day 1) + P(Rainy on Day 2 | Sunny on Day 1) * P(Sunny on Day 1)\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I need to compute each of these terms.\n\nGiven that today is Sunny, let's first find the probabilities for Day 1:\n\n- P(Sunny on Day 1 | Sunny on Day 0) = 70%\n- P(Cloudy on Day 1 | Sunny on Day 0) = 20%\n- P(Rainy on Day 1 | Sunny on Day 0) = 10%\n\nNow, for each possible weather on Day 1, find the probability that Day 2 is Rainy given that weather.\n\nSo, for each case:\n\n1. Day 1 is Rainy (10%):\n   - Given Rainy on Day 1, what's the probability Rainy on Day 2?\n   Looking at the transition from Rainy:\n   - P(Rainy on Day 2 | Rainy on Day 1) = 40%\n\n2. Day 1 is Cloudy (20%):\n   - Given Cloudy on Day 1, what's the probability Rainy on Day 2?\n   From Cloudy, the Rainy probability is 20%.\n\n3. Day 1 is Sunny (70%):\n   - Given Sunny on Day 1, what's the probability Rainy on Day 2?\n   From Sunny, it's 10%.\n\nSo, now, multiply each Day 1 probability with the corresponding Day 2 probability given Day 1, and sum them up.\n\nCalculations:\n\n- P(Rainy on Day 2 | Rainy on Day 1) * P(Rainy on Day 1) = 40% * 10% = 4%\n- P(Rainy on Day 2 | Cloudy on Day 1) * P(Cloudy on Day 1) = 20% * 20% = 4%\n- P(Rainy on Day 2 | Sunny on Day 1) * P(Sunny on Day 1) = 10% * 70% = 7%\n\nNow, add these up: 4% + 4% + 7% = 15%\n\nSo, the probability that it will be Rainy exactly two days from now is 15%.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. So, today is Sunny, so tomorrow has a 10% chance of Rainy. If tomorrow is Rainy, then the next day (two days from now) has a 40% chance. So, 10% * 40% = 4%. If tomorrow is Cloudy (20%), then the next day has a 20% chance, so 20% * 20% = 4%. If tomorrow is Sunny (70%), then the next day has a 10% chance, so 70% * 10% = 7%. Adding them up: 4 + 4 + 7 = 15%. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nI think that's the answer. So, the probability is 15%.\n</think>\n\nThe probability that it will be Rainy exactly two days from now, given that today is Sunny, is calculated by considering all possible transitions from today to tomorrow and then to the day after tomorrow. Breaking it down:\n\n- **Tomorrow's Weather (Day 1):**\n  - Sunny: 70%, Cloudy: 20%, Rainy: 10%.\n\n- **Day 2's Weather (Day 2):**\n  - If Day 1 is Rainy (10%), Day 2 is Rainy with 40% chance.\n  - If Day 1 is Cloudy (20%), Day 2 is Rainy with 20% chance.\n  - If Day 1 is Sunny (70%), Day 2 is Rainy with 10% chance.\n\nCalculating each scenario:\n- Rainy -> Rainy: 10% * 40% = 4%\n- Cloudy -> Rainy: 20% * 20% = 4%\n- Sunny -> Rainy: 70% * 10% = 7%\n\nSumming these probabilities: 4% + 4% + 7% = 15%.\n\n**Answer:** The probability is 15%.

If today is Sunny, what is the probability that it will be Rainy exactly 2 days from now? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out the probability that it will be Rainy exactly two days from today, given that today is Sunny. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, today is Sunny. So, I should look at the probabilities for tomorrow based on today being Sunny. According to the problem, if today is Sunny, tomorrow has a 70% chance of being Sunny, 20% Cloudy, and 10% Rainy. So, tomorrow, the weather could be:\n\n- Sunny with 70% probability\n- Cloudy with 20% probability\n- Rainy with 10% probability\n\nNow, the question is about two days from today, which means I need to consider what happens tomorrow and then the day after tomorrow. Since the weather patterns depend on the previous day, I'll need to use the probabilities for each possible outcome of tomorrow and then compute the probabilities for each possible outcome the day after.\n\nLet me structure this as a tree diagram in my mind. Today is Sunny, so tomorrow has three possible outcomes. For each of those outcomes, I need to determine the probabilities for the day after tomorrow.\n\nLet's denote:\n\n- S: Sunny\n- C: Cloudy\n- R: Rainy\n\nStarting with today being S:\n\n**Day 1: Sunny (70% chance)**\n- **Day 2:**\n  - If Day 2 is S (70% of 70%), then:\n    - Day 3: S with 70% chance\n    - C with 20% chance\n    - R with 10% chance\n  - If Day 2 is C (20% of 70%), then:\n    - Day 3: S with 30% chance\n    - C with 50% chance\n    - R with 20% chance\n  - If Day 2 is R (10% of 70%), then:\n    - Day 3: S with 20% chance\n    - C with 40% chance\n    - R with 40% chance\n\n**Day 1: Cloudy (20% chance)**\n- **Day 2:**\n  - If Day 2 is S (30% of 20%), then:\n    - Day 3: S with 70% chance\n    - C with 20% chance\n    - R with 10% chance\n  - If Day 2 is C (50% of 20%), then:\n    - Day 3: S with 30% chance\n    - C with 50% chance\n    - R with 20% chance\n  - If Day 2 is R (20% of 20%), then:\n    - Day 3: S with 20% chance\n    - C with 40% chance\n    - R with 40% chance\n\n**Day 1: Rainy (10% chance)**\n- **Day 2:**\n  - If Day 2 is S (20% of 10%), then:\n    - Day 3: S with 70% chance\n    - C with 20% chance\n    - R with 10% chance\n  - If Day 2 is C (40% of 10%), then:\n    - Day 3: S with 30% chance\n    - C with 50% chance\n    - R with 20% chance\n  - If Day 2 is R (40% of 10%), then:\n    - Day 3: S with 20% chance\n    - C with 40% chance\n    - R with 40% chance\n\nNow, I need to calculate the total probability of it being Rainy on Day 3 (two days from today). To do this, I'll sum the probabilities of it being Rainy on Day 3 for each possible path.\n\nLet me structure this:\n\n1. **Path 1: S \u2192 S \u2192 R**\n   - Probability: 0.7 (Day 2 is S) * 0.1 (Day 3 is R given Day 2 is S)\n   - So, 0.7 * 0.1 = 0.07\n\n2. **Path 2: S \u2192 C \u2192 R**\n   - Probability: 0.2 (Day 2 is C) * 0.2 (Day 3 is R given Day 2 is C)\n   - So, 0.2 * 0.2 = 0.04\n\n3. **Path 3: S \u2192 R \u2192 R**\n   - Probability: 0.1 (Day 2 is R) * 0.4 (Day 3 is R given Day 2 is R)\n   - So, 0.1 * 0.4 = 0.04\n\nWait, is that all? Let me double-check. I think I might have missed some paths.\n\nActually, from Day 1 (S), Day 2 can be S, C, or R, and each of those leads to Day 3 being S, C, or R. So, for each Day 2 outcome, I need to consider all possible Day 3 outcomes, specifically focusing on R.\n\nSo, let's list all possible paths where Day 3 is R:\n\n1. **S \u2192 S \u2192 R**\n   - Probability: 0.7 * 0.1 = 0.07\n\n2. **S \u2192 C \u2192 R**\n   - Probability: 0.2 * 0.2 = 0.04\n\n3. **S \u2192 R \u2192 R**\n   - Probability: 0.1 * 0.4 = 0.04\n\nAdditionally, there are other paths where Day 2 is R and Day 3 is R, but I think that's already covered.\n\nWait, but I also need to consider that Day 1 is S, and Day 2 can be S, C, or R, each with their own probabilities. So, the total probability is the sum of the probabilities of each path leading to R on Day 3.\n\nSo, adding up the probabilities:\n\n0.07 (Path 1) + 0.04 (Path 2) + 0.04 (Path 3) = 0.15\n\nBut let me verify this because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, I can compute it step by step using conditional probabilities.\n\nLet me define:\n\nP(R on Day 3 | Today is S) = ?\n\nTo compute this, I need to consider all possible weather conditions for Day 2 and Day 3.\n\nSo, P(R on Day 3) = P(S on Day 2) * P(R on Day 3 | S on Day 2) + P(C on Day 2) * P(R on Day 3 | C on Day 2) + P(R on Day 2) * P(R on Day 3 | R on Day 2)\n\nGiven that today is S, P(S on Day 2) = 0.7, P(C on Day 2) = 0.2, P(R on Day 2) = 0.1\n\nNow, P(R on Day 3 | S on Day 2) = 0.1\n\nP(R on Day 3 | C on Day 2) = 0.2\n\nP(R on Day 3 | R on Day 2) = 0.4\n\nTherefore, P(R on Day 3) = (0.7 * 0.1) + (0.2 * 0.2) + (0.1 * 0.4) = 0.07 + 0.04 + 0.04 = 0.15\n\nSo, the probability is 15%.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the numbers because sometimes it's easy to mix up the probabilities.\n\nFrom today being S:\n\n- Day 2: S (70%), C (20%), R (10%)\n\nFrom each of these, the probabilities for Day 3 being R are:\n\n- If Day 2 is S: 10%\n- If Day 2 is C: 20%\n- If Day 2 is R: 40%\n\nSo, the total is:\n\n0.7 * 0.1 = 0.07\n\n0.2 * 0.2 = 0.04\n\n0.1 * 0.4 = 0.04\n\nAdding them up: 0.07 + 0.04 + 0.04 = 0.15\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the probability that it will be Rainy exactly two days from now is 15%.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me consider if there's another approach, maybe using matrices or state transitions.\n\nLet me represent the transition probabilities as a matrix where rows represent the current day's weather, and columns represent the next day's weather.\n\nGiven:\n\n- From S:\n  - S: 0.7\n  - C: 0.2\n  - R: 0.1\n\n- From C:\n  - S: 0.3\n  - C: 0.5\n  - R: 0.2\n\n- From R:\n  - S: 0.2\n  - C: 0.4\n  - R: 0.4\n\nSo, the transition matrix T is:\n\n[ [0.7, 0.2, 0.1],\n  [0.3, 0.5, 0.2],\n  [0.2, 0.4, 0.4] ]\n\nNow, since we start today as S, the initial state vector is [1, 0, 0] (since it's certain to be Sunny today).\n\nTo find the probability distribution for Day 3, we need to compute the state vector after two transitions.\n\nSo, the state vector after Day 2 is S1 = [0.7, 0.2, 0.1]\n\nThen, the state vector after Day 3 (two days from today) is S2 = S1 * T\n\nLet's compute S2:\n\nS2[0] = S1[0] * T[0][0] + S1[1] * T[1][0] + S1[2] * T[2][0]\n= 0.7 * 0.7 + 0.2 * 0.3 + 0.1 * 0.2\n= 0.49 + 0.06 + 0.02\n= 0.57\n\nS2[1] = S1[0] * T[0][1] + S1[1] * T[1][1] + S1[2] * T[2][1]\n= 0.7 * 0.2 + 0.2 * 0.5 + 0.1 * 0.4\n= 0.14 + 0.10 + 0.04\n= 0.28\n\nS2[2] = S1[0] * T[0][2] + S1[1] * T[1][2] + S1[2] * T[2][2]\n= 0.7 * 0.1 + 0.2 * 0.2 + 0.1 * 0.4\n= 0.07 + 0.04 + 0.04\n= 0.15\n\nSo, S2 = [0.57, 0.28, 0.15]\n\nThis means that the probability of Rainy on Day 3 is 15%, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nTherefore, the probability that it will be Rainy exactly two days from now is 15%.\n\nI think this makes sense. I've checked it using two methods: directly calculating each path and using a state transition matrix. Both gave me the same result, so I'm confident it's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe probability that it will be Rainy exactly two days from today, given that today is Sunny, is 15%.\n\n**Answer:** The probability is 15%, so the final answer is \\boxed{0.15} or 15%.\n\nDONE."

Based on historical data, if today is Sunny, then tomorrow has a 70% chance of being Sunny, a 20% chance of being Cloudy, and a 10% chance of being Rainy. If today is Cloudy, then tomorrow has a 50% chance of being Cloudy, a 30% chance of being Sunny, and a 20% chance of being Rainy. If today is Rainy, then tomorrow has a 40% chance of being Rainy, a 40% chance of being Cloudy, and a 20% chance of being Sunny. If today is Sunny, what is the probability that it will be Rainy exactly 2 days from now? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out the probability that it will be Rainy exactly 2 days from today, given that today is Sunny. Hmm, okay. Let me see. \n\nFirst, I know that the weather station categorizes each day as either Sunny, Cloudy, or Rainy. They've provided the probabilities for each day based on the previous day's weather. So, if today is Sunny, tomorrow has a 70% chance of being Sunny, 20% Cloudy, and 10% Rainy. Similarly, they've given the probabilities for the next day based on today's weather and the day after that based on tomorrow's weather. \n\nBut wait, the question is asking about exactly two days from now. So, that means I need to consider the weather on day 1 (today), day 2 (tomorrow), and day 3 (the day after tomorrow). But since the question is about two days from now, I think it's asking for the probability that on day 3, it will be Rainy. \n\nSo, to find the probability that day 3 is Rainy, I need to consider all possible weather outcomes for day 2, given that day 1 is Sunny, and then for each of those outcomes, calculate the probability that day 3 is Rainy. Then, I can sum those probabilities weighted by the chance of each outcome on day 2.\n\nLet me write this down step by step.\n\nDay 1: Sunny (given)\nDay 2: Can be Sunny, Cloudy, or Rainy with probabilities 70%, 20%, and 10% respectively.\nDay 3: Depending on what day 2 is, the probabilities change.\n\nSo, I need to compute the probability for each possible day 2 weather, and then for each of those, multiply by the probability that day 3 is Rainy given day 2's weather.\n\nLet's compute this.\n\nCase 1: Day 2 is Sunny (70% chance)\nGiven that day 2 is Sunny, the probability that day 3 is Rainy is 10%. So, the joint probability for this path is 0.7 * 0.1 = 0.07.\n\nCase 2: Day 2 is Cloudy (20% chance)\nGiven that day 2 is Cloudy, the probability that day 3 is Rainy is 20%. So, the joint probability is 0.2 * 0.2 = 0.04.\n\nCase 3: Day 2 is Rainy (10% chance)\nGiven that day 2 is Rainy, the probability that day 3 is Rainy is 40%. So, the joint probability is 0.1 * 0.4 = 0.04.\n\nNow, to find the total probability that day 3 is Rainy, I need to add up these three cases.\n\nTotal probability = 0.07 + 0.04 + 0.04 = 0.15.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. So, the probability that it will be Rainy exactly two days from now is 15%.\n\nLet me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, today is Sunny. So, day 2 has probabilities: Sunny 70%, Cloudy 20%, Rainy 10%.\n\nFor each of those:\n\n- If day 2 is Sunny (70%), then day 3 has a 10% chance of Rainy. So, 0.7 * 0.1 = 0.07.\n\n- If day 2 is Cloudy (20%), then day 3 has a 20% chance of Rainy. So, 0.2 * 0.2 = 0.04.\n\n- If day 2 is Rainy (10%), then day 3 has a 40% chance of Rainy. So, 0.1 * 0.4 = 0.04.\n\nAdding them up: 0.07 + 0.04 + 0.04 = 0.15, which is 15%.\n\nYes, that seems correct. I don't think I missed anything here. So, the probability is 15%.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the probability that it will be Rainy exactly two days from today, given that today is Sunny, we analyze the possible weather outcomes for the next two days.\n\n1. **Day 1 (Today): Sunny**\n2. **Day 2:**\n   - **Sunny:** 70% probability\n   - **Cloudy:** 20% probability\n   - **Rainy:** 10% probability\n3. **Day 3:**\n   - If Day 2 is Sunny: Rainy probability = 10%\n   - If Day 2 is Cloudy: Rainy probability = 20%\n   - If Day 2 is Rainy: Rainy probability = 40%\n\nCalculate the joint probabilities for each path leading to Rainy on Day 3:\n\n- **Sunny \u2192 Rainy:** 0.7 * 0.1 = 0.07\n- **Cloudy \u2192 Rainy:** 0.2 * 0.2 = 0.04\n- **Rainy \u2192 Rainy:** 0.1 * 0.4 = 0.04\n\nSum these probabilities:\n\n0.07 + 0.04 + 0.04 = 0.15\n\n**Answer:** The probability that it will be Rainy exactly two days from now is 15%.\n\nDONE."

If today is Sunny, what is the probability that it will be Rainy exactly 2 days from now? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this problem about a weather station categorizing days as Sunny, Cloudy, or Rainy. I need to find the probability that it will be Rainy exactly 2 days from now, given that today is Sunny. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I understand that the problem is about probability transitions over days. Each day, the weather can be one of three types, and based on today's weather, there are certain probabilities for tomorrow. Since we're dealing with two days from now, I think I need to consider the possible weather conditions for each of the next two days, but specifically focusing on the scenarios where it rains on the second day after today.\n\nSo, today is Sunny. Let's denote today as Day 0. Then, tomorrow is Day 1, and the day after that is Day 2. We're interested in the probability that Day 2 is Rainy.\n\nTo approach this, I think I need to consider all possible sequences of weather for Days 0, 1, and 2, and then calculate the probability for each sequence where Day 2 is Rainy. Then, sum those probabilities to get the final result.\n\nLet me list out the probabilities given in the problem:\n\n- **If today (Day 0) is Sunny:**\n  - Tomorrow (Day 1): 70% Sunny, 20% Cloudy, 10% Rainy.\n  \n- **If today (Day 0) is Cloudy:**\n  - Tomorrow (Day 1): 30% Sunny, 50% Cloudy, 20% Rainy.\n  \n- **If today (Day 0) is Rainy:**\n  - Tomorrow (Day 1): 20% Sunny, 40% Cloudy, 40% Rainy.\n\nBut since today is Sunny, we only need the first set of probabilities. So, starting from Day 0 being Sunny, let's map out the possibilities for Day 1 and then Day 2.\n\nSo, Day 0: Sunny (100% probability, as given).\n\nDay 1 can be Sunny, Cloudy, or Rainy with probabilities 70%, 20%, and 10%, respectively.\n\nFor each of these Day 1 outcomes, we need to determine the probability distribution for Day 2, and then see the probability that Day 2 is Rainy.\n\nLet me structure this:\n\n1. **Case 1:** Day 1 is Sunny (70% probability)\n   - From the given data, if Day 1 is Sunny, then Day 2 has:\n     - 70% Sunny\n     - 20% Cloudy\n     - 10% Rainy\n   - So, the probability that Day 2 is Rainy given Day 1 is Sunny is 10%.\n\n2. **Case 2:** Day 1 is Cloudy (20% probability)\n   - If Day 1 is Cloudy, then Day 2 has:\n     - 30% Sunny\n     - 50% Cloudy\n     - 20% Rainy\n   - Therefore, the probability that Day 2 is Rainy given Day 1 is Cloudy is 20%.\n\n3. **Case 3:** Day 1 is Rainy (10% probability)\n   - If Day 1 is Rainy, then Day 2 has:\n     - 20% Sunny\n     - 40% Cloudy\n     - 40% Rainy\n   - So, the probability that Day 2 is Rainy given Day 1 is Rainy is 40%.\n\nNow, to find the total probability that Day 2 is Rainy, I need to calculate the weighted average of these probabilities based on the likelihood of each Day 1 outcome.\n\nSo, the formula would be:\n\nP(Rainy on Day 2 | Sunny on Day 0) = P(Rainy on Day 2 | Day 1 is Sunny) * P(Day 1 is Sunny | Day 0 is Sunny) + P(Rainy on Day 2 | Day 1 is Cloudy) * P(Day 1 is Cloudy | Day 0 is Sunny) + P(Rainy on Day 2 | Day 1 is Rainy) * P(Day 1 is Rainy | Day 0 is Sunny)\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n= (10%) * 70% + (20%) * 20% + (40%) * 10%\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\n- 10% of 70% is 0.10 * 0.70 = 0.07\n- 20% of 20% is 0.20 * 0.20 = 0.04\n- 40% of 10% is 0.40 * 0.10 = 0.04\n\nNow, adding these together: 0.07 + 0.04 + 0.04 = 0.15\n\nSo, 0.15, which is 15%.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst term: 0.1 * 0.7 = 0.07\n\nSecond term: 0.2 * 0.2 = 0.04\n\nThird term: 0.4 * 0.1 = 0.04\n\nAdding them: 0.07 + 0.04 = 0.11, plus 0.04 gives 0.15, which is 15%.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the probability that it will be Rainy exactly 2 days from now, given that today is Sunny, is 15%.\n\nI think that's the answer. Let me just make sure I didn't miss any other cases or miscalculate the transitions.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to create a tree diagram:\n\n- Day 0: Sunny (100%)\n\n  - Day 1:\n    - Sunny (70%)\n      - Day 2: Rainy (10%)\n    - Cloudy (20%)\n      - Day 2: Rainy (20%)\n    - Rainy (10%)\n      - Day 2: Rainy (40%)\n\nSo, the total Rainy on Day 2 is:\n\n(70% * 10%) + (20% * 20%) + (10% * 40%) = 0.07 + 0.04 + 0.04 = 0.15 or 15%.\n\nYes, that's consistent.\n\nI think I've covered all possible paths and correctly applied the conditional probabilities. So, I'm confident that the answer is 15%.\n</think>\n\nThe probability that it will be Rainy exactly 2 days from now, given that today is Sunny, is calculated by considering all possible weather conditions for the next two days. By analyzing each transition and summing the probabilities where Day 2 is Rainy, we find the total probability to be 15%.\n\n**Answer:** The probability is 15%.\n\nDONE."

If today is Rainy, then tomorrow has a 40% chance of being Rainy, a 40% chance of being Cloudy, and a 20% chance of being Sunny. If today is Sunny, what is the probability that it will be Rainy exactly 2 days from now? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem about weather prediction, and I need to find the probability that it will be Rainy exactly two days from today. The weather station categorizes each day as either Sunny, Cloudy, or Rainy. The probabilities for tomorrow's weather depend on today's weather. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll try to visualize the problem. Today is a specific day, let's say Day 0. Tomorrow is Day 1, and the day after that is Day 2, which is the day we're interested in. So, I need to find the probability that Day 2 is Rainy.\n\nTo do this, I think I need to consider all possible weather conditions for Day 0 and then calculate the probabilities accordingly. Since today could be Sunny, Cloudy, or Rainy, I should probably calculate the probability for each case and then combine them.\n\nLet me outline the given probabilities:\n\n- **If today is Sunny:**\n  - Tomorrow (Day 1): 70% Sunny, 20% Cloudy, 10% Rainy.\n  \n- **If today is Cloudy:**\n  - Tomorrow (Day 1): 30% Sunny, 50% Cloudy, 20% Rainy.\n  \n- **If today is Rainy:**\n  - Tomorrow (Day 1): 20% Sunny, 40% Cloudy, 40% Rainy.\n\nWait, but the problem doesn't specify the probability distribution for today. It just gives the transition probabilities from today to tomorrow. Hmm, that might complicate things because without knowing the initial probabilities for today, I can't directly compute the probabilities for Day 2. Maybe I need to assume that each weather condition is equally likely? Or perhaps the initial day is equally likely to be Sunny, Cloudy, or Rainy.\n\nLet me check the problem statement again. It says, \"if today is Sunny...\" and so on. So, it seems like the question is asking for the probability that tomorrow will be Rainy given that today is Sunny, but then it's compounded over two days. Wait, no, actually, it's asking for the probability that two days from now it will be Rainy, so that's Day 2.\n\nSo, to get from Day 0 to Day 2, I need to consider the possible transitions through Day 1.\n\nTherefore, I think I need to model this as a Markov chain with states Sunny, Cloudy, Rainy, and transition probabilities between them as given.\n\nSince the problem is about two days ahead, I need to compute the probability of Rainy on Day 2, given the transitions from Day 0 to Day 1 and then Day 1 to Day 2.\n\nBut since the problem doesn't specify the initial distribution for Day 0, I might need to assume that each day is equally likely to be Sunny, Cloudy, or Rainy. So, let's assume that the probability for each weather condition on Day 0 is 1/3.\n\nAlternatively, if it's not specified, perhaps I need to consider the problem differently. Wait, actually, the problem states: \"if today is Sunny...\" etc., so it's conditional on today's weather. Therefore, I think the correct approach is to consider that today is a specific weather condition, and from there, compute the probabilities for tomorrow and the day after.\n\nBut wait, the question is about two days from now, so I need to go from today (Day 0) to tomorrow (Day 1) and then to the day after tomorrow (Day 2). So, I need to compute the probability that Day 2 is Rainy, considering the transitions from Day 0 to Day 1 and then from Day 1 to Day 2.\n\nHowever, without knowing the initial distribution for Day 0, I can't compute the exact probability. So, perhaps the problem assumes that today is equally likely to be Sunny, Cloudy, or Rainy. Or maybe it's given that today is Sunny, as in the first conditional statement. Wait, let me check the problem again.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"If today is Sunny, then tomorrow has a 70% chance of being Sunny, a 20% chance of being Cloudy, and a 10% chance of being Rainy.\" Then it gives similar information for Cloudy and Rainy days. Then it asks: \"If today is Sunny, what is the probability that it will be Rainy exactly 2 days from now?\"\n\nOh! So, it's given that today is Sunny. So, today is Sunny, and we need to find the probability that two days from now, it will be Rainy. So, that simplifies things. So, today is Sunny, so we can compute Day 1 based on today, and then Day 2 based on Day 1.\n\nSo, let's structure this:\n\nDay 0: Sunny\n\nDay 1: depends on Day 0, which is Sunny. So, from Sunny, tomorrow (Day 1) has 70% Sunny, 20% Cloudy, 10% Rainy.\n\nThen, Day 2 depends on Day 1. So, depending on what Day 1 is, we can compute Day 2's probability.\n\nTherefore, the process is:\n\n1. Today is Sunny (Day 0).\n\n2. Compute probabilities for Day 1 based on Day 0.\n\n3. For each possible weather condition on Day 1, compute the probabilities for Day 2.\n\n4. Multiply the probabilities along the path and sum them up to get the total probability that Day 2 is Rainy.\n\nSo, let's do this step by step.\n\nFirst, Day 0 is Sunny.\n\nSo, Day 1 has:\n\n- 70% Sunny\n\n- 20% Cloudy\n\n- 10% Rainy\n\nNow, for each of these, we need to compute Day 2.\n\nSo, let's break it down:\n\nCase 1: Day 1 is Sunny (70% chance)\n\nThen, Day 2 will have the same transition probabilities as from Sunny to tomorrow. So, from Sunny, tomorrow has 70% Sunny, 20% Cloudy, 10% Rainy. Therefore, if Day 1 is Sunny, Day 2 has:\n\n- 70% Sunny\n\n- 20% Cloudy\n\n- 10% Rainy\n\nBut since we're only interested in Rainy on Day 2, the contribution from this case is 10%.\n\nBut wait, no. The total probability is the sum over all paths that lead to Rainy on Day 2.\n\nSo, in this case, the path is Day 0 -> Day 1 -> Day 2.\n\nSince Day 0 is Sunny, Day 1 can be Sunny, Cloudy, or Rainy with the given probabilities. Then, for each of these, Day 2 can be anything, but we only care about the cases where Day 2 is Rainy.\n\nTherefore, the total probability is the sum over each possible Day 1 weather, multiplied by the probability that Day 2 is Rainy given Day 1's weather.\n\nSo, let's denote:\n\nP(D2=Rainy) = P(D1=Sunny) * P(D2=Rainy | D1=Sunny) + P(D1=Cloudy) * P(D2=Rainy | D1=Cloudy) + P(D1=Rainy) * P(D2=Rainy | D1=Rainy)\n\nGiven that today is Sunny (Day 0), so:\n\nP(D1=Sunny) = 0.7\n\nP(D1=Cloudy) = 0.2\n\nP(D1=Rainy) = 0.1\n\nNow, we need P(D2=Rainy | D1=Sunny), P(D2=Rainy | D1=Cloudy), and P(D2=Rainy | D1=Rainy).\n\nFrom the problem statement:\n\n- If today is Sunny, tomorrow has 70% Sunny, 20% Cloudy, 10% Rainy. So, P(D2=Rainy | D1=Sunny) = 0.1\n\n- If today is Cloudy, tomorrow has 30% Sunny, 50% Cloudy, 20% Rainy. So, P(D2=Rainy | D1=Cloudy) = 0.2\n\n- If today is Rainy, tomorrow has 20% Sunny, 40% Cloudy, 40% Rainy. So, P(D2=Rainy | D1=Rainy) = 0.4\n\nTherefore, plugging in the numbers:\n\nP(D2=Rainy) = (0.7 * 0.1) + (0.2 * 0.2) + (0.1 * 0.4)\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\n0.7 * 0.1 = 0.07\n\n0.2 * 0.2 = 0.04\n\n0.1 * 0.4 = 0.04\n\nAdding them up: 0.07 + 0.04 + 0.04 = 0.15\n\nSo, the probability that it will be Rainy exactly two days from now is 15%.\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, today is Sunny.\n\nDay 1:\n\n- 70% Sunny, 20% Cloudy, 10% Rainy.\n\nThen, for each Day 1, compute Day 2 Rainy.\n\nSo, for Day 1:\n\n- If Sunny (70%), Day 2 Rainy is 10% \u2192 0.7*0.1=0.07\n\n- If Cloudy (20%), Day 2 Rainy is 20% \u2192 0.2*0.2=0.04\n\n- If Rainy (10%), Day 2 Rainy is 40% \u2192 0.1*0.4=0.04\n\nTotal: 0.07 + 0.04 + 0.04 = 0.15 \u2192 15%.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the probability is 15%.\n\nI think that's it.\n</think>\n\nThe probability that it will be Rainy exactly two days from now is 15%.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Understand the Problem:**\n   - We need to find the probability that two days from today (Day 2), the weather will be Rainy.\n   - The weather transitions are given based on the current day's condition.\n\n2. **Given Transition Probabilities:**\n   - **If today is Sunny:**\n     - Tomorrow (Day 1): 70% Sunny, 20% Cloudy, 10% Rainy.\n   - **If today is Cloudy:**\n     - Tomorrow (Day 1): 30% Sunny, 50% Cloudy, 20% Rainy.\n   - **If today is Rainy:**\n     - Tomorrow (Day 1): 20% Sunny, 40% Cloudy, 40% Rainy.\n\n3. **Assumption:**\n   - Today (Day 0) is Sunny.

If today is Rainy, then tomorrow has a 40% chance of being Rainy, a 40% chance of being Cloudy, and a 20% chance of being Sunny. If today is Sunny, what is the probability that it will be Rainy exactly 2 days from now? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out the probability that it will be Rainy exactly two days from today, given that today is Sunny. Hmm, let's break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, I know that today is Sunny. The problem gives me the probabilities for tomorrow based on today's weather. Specifically, if today is Sunny, tomorrow has a 70% chance of being Sunny, 20% Cloudy, and 10% Rainy. So, tomorrow's weather is dependent on today's.\n\nBut we need the probability for two days from now, which means I have to consider what happens tomorrow and then the day after tomorrow. So, it's a two-step process. I think I should use conditional probability here, maybe the law of total probability.\n\nLet me outline the probabilities:\n\n- Today is Sunny (S).\n- Tomorrow's weather depends on today:\n  - Sunny (S): 70%\n  - Cloudy (C): 20%\n  - Rainy (R): 10%\n  \n- If today is Cloudy (C):\n  - Cloudy (C): 50%\n  - Sunny (S): 30%\n  - Rainy (R): 20%\n  \n- If today is Rainy (R):\n  - Rainy (R): 40%\n  - Cloudy (C): 40%\n  - Sunny (S): 20%\n\nBut since today is Sunny, I only need to consider the first set of probabilities for tomorrow. So, tomorrow's weather possibilities are:\n\n- Sunny: 70%\n- Cloudy: 20%\n- Rainy: 10%\n\nNow, for the day after tomorrow, I need to consider the probabilities based on what tomorrow's weather is. That means I have to calculate the probability of Rainy two days from now by considering all possible paths: Sunny -> ?, Cloudy -> ?, Rainy -> ?.\n\nWait, actually, since tomorrow's weather is dependent on today, which is Sunny, I can model this as a Markov chain with transitions. The states are Sunny, Cloudy, Rainy, and the transition probabilities are given.\n\nSo, starting from Sunny, the possible transitions for tomorrow are:\n\n- Sunny: 70%\n- Cloudy: 20%\n- Rainy: 10%\n\nThen, for each of those, the transitions for the day after tomorrow:\n\n1. If tomorrow is Sunny (70%), then the day after tomorrow:\n   - Sunny: 70%\n   - Cloudy: 20%\n   - Rainy: 10%\n   \n2. If tomorrow is Cloudy (20%), then the day after tomorrow:\n   - Cloudy: 50%\n   - Sunny: 30%\n   - Rainy: 20%\n   \n3. If tomorrow is Rainy (10%), then the day after tomorrow:\n   - Rainy: 40%\n   - Cloudy: 40%\n   - Sunny: 20%\n\nTo find the probability that it will be Rainy exactly two days from now, I need to compute the total probability of Rainy two days from today. That is, the sum of the probabilities of all paths that end in Rainy two days from today.\n\nSo, the paths are:\n\n- Sunny -> Sunny -> Rainy\n- Sunny -> Cloudy -> Rainy\n- Sunny -> Rainy -> Rainy\n\nEach of these paths contributes to the total probability. I need to calculate each path's probability and sum them up.\n\nLet me calculate each path:\n\n1. Sunny -> Sunny -> Rainy:\n   - Probability of Sunny today: 1 (since we're given today is Sunny)\n   - Probability of Sunny tomorrow: 70% = 0.7\n   - Probability of Rainy day after tomorrow: 10% = 0.1\n   - So, the probability for this path: 1 * 0.7 * 0.1 = 0.07\n\n2. Sunny -> Cloudy -> Rainy:\n   - Probability of Sunny today: 1\n   - Probability of Cloudy tomorrow: 20% = 0.2\n   - Probability of Rainy day after tomorrow: 20% = 0.2\n   - So, the probability for this path: 1 * 0.2 * 0.2 = 0.04\n\n3. Sunny -> Rainy -> Rainy:\n   - Probability of Sunny today: 1\n   - Probability of Rainy tomorrow: 10% = 0.1\n   - Probability of Rainy day after tomorrow: 40% = 0.4\n   - So, the probability for this path: 1 * 0.1 * 0.4 = 0.04\n\nNow, sum these probabilities:\n\nTotal probability = 0.07 + 0.04 + 0.04 = 0.15\n\nSo, the probability that it will be Rainy exactly two days from now, given that today is Sunny, is 15%.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFor the first path: 0.7 * 0.1 = 0.07, correct.\n\nSecond path: 0.2 * 0.2 = 0.04, correct.\n\nThird path: 0.1 * 0.4 = 0.04, correct.\n\nAdding them: 0.07 + 0.04 + 0.04 = 0.15, which is 15%. That seems right.\n\nI think that's the correct approach. Using the law of total probability by considering all possible intermediate states (tomorrow's weather) and then calculating the probabilities accordingly. Yeah, that should give the correct result.\n</think>\n\nThe probability that it will be Rainy exactly two days from today, given that today is Sunny, is calculated by considering all possible paths through tomorrow's weather. Summing the probabilities of each path that ends in Rainy gives a total probability of 15%.\n\n**Answer:** The probability is 15%.\n\nDONE."

If today is Cloudy, then tomorrow has a 50% chance of being Cloudy, a 30% chance of being Sunny, and a 20% chance of being Rainy. If today is Rainy, then tomorrow has a 40% chance of being Rainy, a 40% chance of being Cloudy, and a 20% chance of being Sunny. If today is Sunny, what is the probability that it will be Rainy exactly 2 days from now? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this probability problem to solve, and I need to figure out the chance that it will be Rainy exactly two days from today. Let me try to break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, the problem gives me the probabilities for the weather each day based on today's weather. Specifically, it tells me the probabilities for tomorrow depending on what today is like. Today is Sunny, and I need to find the probability that two days from now it will be Rainy. That means I have to consider what happens tomorrow and then the day after tomorrow.\n\nLet me write down the given probabilities to have them clear in my mind:\n\n- If today is Sunny:\n  - Tomorrow: 70% Sunny, 20% Cloudy, 10% Rainy.\n- If today is Cloudy:\n  - Tomorrow: 30% Sunny, 50% Cloudy, 20% Rainy.\n- If today is Rainy:\n  - Tomorrow: 20% Sunny, 40% Cloudy, 40% Rainy.\n\nWait, no, hold on. Let me make sure I have that right. The problem says:\n\n- If today is Sunny, tomorrow has 70% Sunny, 20% Cloudy, 10% Rainy.\n- If today is Cloudy, tomorrow has 30% Sunny, 50% Cloudy, 20% Rainy.\n- If today is Rainy, tomorrow has 40% Rainy, 40% Cloudy, 20% Sunny.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo today is Sunny. I need to find the probability that two days from now it will be Rainy. That means I have to consider the weather for tomorrow and the day after tomorrow.\n\nSince today is Sunny, I can use the first set of probabilities to figure out tomorrow's weather. Then, based on tomorrow's weather, I can use the appropriate probabilities to figure out the day after tomorrow's weather.\n\nSo, first, tomorrow's weather:\n\n- Tomorrow: 70% Sunny, 20% Cloudy, 10% Rainy.\n\nNow, depending on what tomorrow's weather is, I'll have different probabilities for the day after tomorrow.\n\nLet me structure this:\n\n1. Start with today: Sunny\n2. Tomorrow: based on today, 70% Sunny, 20% Cloudy, 10% Rainy\n3. For each possible tomorrow's weather, calculate the probability that the day after tomorrow is Rainy.\n\nSo, I need to consider each possible outcome for tomorrow and then, for each of those, the probability that the day after tomorrow is Rainy.\n\nThis is a two-step process:\n\nFirst, find the probability distribution for tomorrow.\n\nSecond, for each possible tomorrow's weather, find the probability that the day after tomorrow is Rainy, then combine them weighted by tomorrow's probability.\n\nSo, mathematically, the total probability P(Rainy two days from now) is equal to:\n\nP(Tomorrow is Sunny) * P(Tomorrow is Rainy | Today is Sunny) + P(Tomorrow is Cloudy) * P(Tomorrow is Rainy | Tomorrow is Cloudy) + P(Tomorrow is Rainy) * P(Tomorrow is Rainy | Tomorrow is Rainy)\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again.\n\nActually, it's:\n\nP(Tomorrow is Sunny) * P(Tomorrow2 is Rainy | Tomorrow is Sunny) +\n\nP(Tomorrow is Cloudy) * P(Tomorrow2 is Rainy | Tomorrow is Cloudy) +\n\nP(Tomorrow is Rainy) * P(Tomorrow2 is Rainy | Tomorrow is Rainy)\n\nYes, that's right. Because tomorrow's weather can be Sunny, Cloudy, or Rainy, each with their own probabilities, and for each of those, the probability that the day after tomorrow is Rainy depends on tomorrow's weather.\n\nSo, let's compute each term.\n\nFirst, P(Tomorrow is Sunny) is 70%, or 0.7.\n\nGiven that tomorrow is Sunny, what is the probability that tomorrow2 is Rainy? Looking back at the given data, if today is Sunny, tomorrow has 10% chance of Rainy. So, if tomorrow is Sunny, then tomorrow2 can be determined based on tomorrow's weather, which is Sunny.\n\nWait, hold on. The problem gives the probabilities for tomorrow based on today, but it doesn't directly give the probabilities for the day after tomorrow based on tomorrow's weather. Hmm, that might be a problem.\n\nWait, let me check. The problem says:\n\n\"If today is Sunny, then tomorrow has a 70% chance of being Sunny, 20% Cloudy, and 10% Rainy.\"\n\nSimilarly for Cloudy and Rainy today.\n\nBut it doesn't provide the transition probabilities from tomorrow's weather to tomorrow2's weather. So, I need to infer that.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to assume that the same transition probabilities apply? Or maybe the problem is designed so that I can chain the probabilities.\n\nWait, no, that might not be the case. Let me think.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the given probabilities are for tomorrow, but not beyond that. So, to get the day after tomorrow, I need to consider the transition from tomorrow to tomorrow2, but the problem doesn't give those probabilities.\n\nHmm, that seems like a problem. Did I misread the question?\n\nWait, let me read the question again:\n\n\"If today is Sunny, what is the probability that it will be Rainy exactly 2 days from now?\"\n\nSo, today is Sunny, tomorrow's probabilities are given, but the day after tomorrow's probabilities are not directly given. So, I think I need to model the weather as a Markov chain, where each day depends only on the previous day.\n\nTherefore, to get tomorrow2's probabilities, I need to consider the transitions from tomorrow's weather.\n\nBut the problem only gives the transition probabilities from today to tomorrow, not from tomorrow to tomorrow2.\n\nSo, perhaps I need to assume that the same transition probabilities apply for tomorrow to tomorrow2. That is, the transition matrix is the same each day.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects me to recognize that I need to consider the possible weather states for tomorrow and then for each, compute the probability that tomorrow2 is Rainy.\n\nWait, perhaps I can structure it as follows:\n\nSince today is Sunny, tomorrow can be Sunny, Cloudy, or Rainy with probabilities 0.7, 0.2, and 0.1, respectively.\n\nThen, for each of those possibilities for tomorrow, I need to know the probability that tomorrow2 is Rainy.\n\nBut to do that, I need the transition probabilities from tomorrow's weather to tomorrow2's weather.\n\nHowever, the problem only gives the transition probabilities from today to tomorrow, not from tomorrow to tomorrow2.\n\nHmm, this is a problem. Maybe I need to make an assumption here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to consider that the transition probabilities are the same each day, so the same as from today to tomorrow. But that might not be correct because the problem gives different probabilities for each starting day.\n\nWait, let me think. The problem gives:\n\n- Today is Sunny, so tomorrow has certain probabilities.\n\nBut for tomorrow, if it's Sunny, Cloudy, or Rainy, the problem doesn't specify the transition probabilities. So, perhaps I need to assume that the same transition probabilities apply, meaning that from any day, the next day's probabilities are as given in the problem. But that can't be, because the problem only gives the transition from today to tomorrow.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently.\n\nSuppose I need to find the probability that two days from now is Rainy. So, starting from today, which is Sunny, I need to go two steps ahead.\n\nSo, first, tomorrow's weather is determined by today's, and then tomorrow2's weather is determined by tomorrow's.\n\nSo, the process is:\n\nToday: Sunny\n\nTomorrow: depends on today, which is Sunny, so 70% Sunny, 20% Cloudy, 10% Rainy.\n\nThen, tomorrow2: depends on tomorrow's weather, which could be Sunny, Cloudy, or Rainy.\n\nBut the problem only gives the transition probabilities from today to tomorrow, not from tomorrow to tomorrow2.\n\nSo, unless the problem is implying that the same transition probabilities apply, meaning that from tomorrow's weather, the day after has the same probabilities as from today to tomorrow.\n\nWait, that might be the case. Let me check.\n\nIf that's the case, then from tomorrow's weather (which could be Sunny, Cloudy, or Rainy), the day after (tomorrow2) would have the same transition probabilities as today to tomorrow.\n\nBut that would mean that from tomorrow's weather, tomorrow2 has the same probabilities as today to tomorrow. But that might not be correct because the problem gives different probabilities depending on today's weather.\n\nWait, no, the problem gives different probabilities based on today's weather. So, perhaps from tomorrow's weather, we need to use the same approach as from today.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is designed so that I can consider that the day after tomorrow's probabilities are the same as tomorrow's, but that might not be accurate.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem expects me to model the weather as a Markov chain with the given transition matrix, and then compute the probability two steps ahead.\n\nBut the problem only gives the transition probabilities from today to tomorrow, not from tomorrow to tomorrow2. So, unless I can infer the transition probabilities from tomorrow to tomorrow2, I can't compute this.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is only giving the first transition, and I need to assume that the same transition probabilities apply. That is, from any day, the next day has the same probabilities as from today to tomorrow.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense because the problem gives different probabilities based on today's weather.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again.\n\n\"A weather station categorizes each day as either 'Sunny', 'Cloudy', or 'Rainy'. Based on historical data, if today is Sunny, then tomorrow has a 70% chance of being Sunny, a 20% chance of being Cloudy, and a 10% chance of being Rainy. If today is Cloudy, then tomorrow has a 50% chance of being Cloudy, a 30% chance of being Sunny, and a 20% chance of being Rainy. If today is Rainy, then tomorrow has a 40% chance of being Rainy, a 40% chance of being Cloudy, and a 20% chance of being Sunny. If today is Sunny, what is the probability that it will be Rainy exactly 2 days from now?\"\n\nSo, the problem gives the transition probabilities from today to tomorrow for each possible today. But it doesn't give the transition probabilities from tomorrow to tomorrow2. So, perhaps I need to model this as a Markov chain with the given transition matrix and then compute the two-step transition probability.\n\nBut the problem is that the transition matrix is only given for one step. So, to compute two steps, I need to square the transition matrix or find the two-step transition probabilities.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the same transition probabilities apply each day, meaning that from any day, the next day has the same probabilities as from today to tomorrow.\n\nBut that can't be, because the problem gives different probabilities based on today's weather.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the transition probabilities are the same regardless of the day. So, if today is Sunny, tomorrow has 70% Sunny, etc. Similarly, if tomorrow is Sunny, the next day (tomorrow2) has 70% Sunny, etc. But that would mean that the same probabilities apply regardless of the day, which might not be the case.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps that's the assumption I have to make.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the transition probabilities are the same for any day, meaning that from any weather state, the next day has the same probabilities as from today to tomorrow.\n\nBut that seems inconsistent because the problem gives different probabilities based on today's weather.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think of it differently. Let's consider that the problem gives the transition probabilities from today to tomorrow, but not beyond. So, to get the day after tomorrow, I need to consider the possible transitions from tomorrow's weather.\n\nBut since the problem doesn't give the transition probabilities from tomorrow to tomorrow2, I can't directly compute it. Therefore, perhaps the problem expects me to assume that the transition probabilities are the same as from today to tomorrow.\n\nIn other words, from tomorrow's weather, the day after tomorrow has the same probabilities as from today to tomorrow.\n\nSo, for example, if tomorrow is Sunny, then tomorrow2 has 70% Sunny, 20% Cloudy, 10% Rainy.\n\nSimilarly, if tomorrow is Cloudy, then tomorrow2 has 30% Sunny, 50% Cloudy, 20% Rainy.\n\nAnd if tomorrow is Rainy, then tomorrow2 has 20% Sunny, 40% Cloudy, 40% Rainy.\n\nIs this a valid assumption? The problem doesn't specify, but perhaps that's what is intended.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the transition probabilities are the same regardless of the day, so the same as from today to tomorrow.\n\nTherefore, I think I have to proceed under that assumption because otherwise, I can't compute the two-step transition.\n\nSo, assuming that, let's proceed.\n\nTherefore, the process is:\n\nToday: Sunny\n\nTomorrow: 70% Sunny, 20% Cloudy, 10% Rainy.\n\nTomorrow2: Depending on tomorrow's weather, which can be Sunny, Cloudy, or Rainy, each with their own probabilities, and for each, tomorrow2 has the same transition probabilities as from today to tomorrow.\n\nTherefore, the probability that tomorrow2 is Rainy is the sum over all possible tomorrow's weather of the probability that tomorrow is that weather times the probability that tomorrow2 is Rainy given tomorrow's weather.\n\nMathematically:\n\nP(Rainy two days from now) = P(Tomorrow is Sunny) * P(Rainy | Tomorrow is Sunny) + P(Tomorrow is Cloudy) * P(Rainy | Tomorrow is Cloudy) + P(Tomorrow is Rainy) * P(Rainy | Tomorrow is Rainy)\n\nNow, let's plug in the numbers.\n\nFirst, P(Tomorrow is Sunny) = 0.7\n\nP(Rainy | Tomorrow is Sunny) = 10% = 0.1\n\nSecond, P(Tomorrow is Cloudy) = 20% = 0.2\n\nP(Rainy | Tomorrow is Cloudy) = 20% = 0.2\n\nThird, P(Tomorrow is Rainy) = 10% = 0.1\n\nP(Rainy | Tomorrow is Rainy) = 40% = 0.4\n\nSo, plugging these in:\n\nP(Rainy two days from now) = 0.7 * 0.1 + 0.2 * 0.2 + 0.1 * 0.4\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\n0.7 * 0.1 = 0.07\n\n0.2 * 0.2 = 0.04\n\n0.1 * 0.4 = 0.04\n\nAdding them up: 0.07 + 0.04 + 0.04 = 0.15\n\nSo, the probability is 15%.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check my steps.\n\nFirst, today is Sunny.\n\nTomorrow: 70% Sunny, 20% Cloudy, 10% Rainy.\n\nThen, for each of tomorrow's states:\n\nIf tomorrow is Sunny (70%), then tomorrow2 has 10% Rainy.\n\nIf tomorrow is Cloudy (20%), then tomorrow2 has 20% Rainy.\n\nIf tomorrow is Rainy (10%), then tomorrow2 has 40% Rainy.\n\nSo, the total probability is:\n\n0.7 * 0.1 = 0.07\n\n0.2 * 0.2 = 0.04\n\n0.1 * 0.4 = 0.04\n\nAdding up: 0.07 + 0.04 + 0.04 = 0.15, which is 15%.\n\nSo, the probability is 15%.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Is this the correct approach?\n\nBecause I'm assuming that the transition probabilities from tomorrow to tomorrow2 are the same as from today to tomorrow. But the problem only gives the transition probabilities from today to tomorrow, not beyond. So, perhaps the problem is intended to be modeled as a Markov chain with the given transition matrix, and then we compute the two-step transition.\n\nBut the problem is that the transition matrix is only given for one step. So, to compute two steps, we need to square the transition matrix or find the two-step transition probabilities.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the transition probabilities are the same each day, so from any day to the next, the probabilities are as given.\n\nTherefore, to compute two days from now, we can model it as two independent steps with the same transition matrix.\n\nBut in reality, the transition matrix might not be the same each day, but since the problem only gives the transition from today to tomorrow, perhaps that's what we have to use.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the transition probabilities are the same regardless of the day, so from any day to the next, the probabilities are as given.\n\nIn that case, the two-step transition probabilities would be the same as the one-step transition probabilities because each day has the same transition probabilities.\n\nBut that might not be the case because the problem gives different probabilities based on today's weather, implying that the transition probabilities depend on the current day's weather.\n\nWait, but in reality, the transition probabilities are from the current day to the next day, so they are given based on today's weather.\n\nTherefore, to compute two days from now, we need to consider the transition from today to tomorrow, and then from tomorrow to tomorrow2.\n\nBut since the problem only gives the transition from today to tomorrow, and not from tomorrow to tomorrow2, perhaps the problem expects us to assume that the same transition probabilities apply.\n\nTherefore, using that assumption, the calculation I did earlier is correct.\n\nSo, the probability is 15%.\n\nBut let me double-check the numbers.\n\nToday: Sunny\n\nTomorrow:\n\n- 70% Sunny\n\n- 20% Cloudy\n\n- 10% Rainy\n\nThen, for each of those, tomorrow2's Rainy probability:\n\n- If tomorrow is Sunny: 10%\n\n- If tomorrow is Cloudy: 20%\n\n- If tomorrow is Rainy: 40%\n\nSo, the total probability is:\n\n0.7*0.1 + 0.2*0.2 + 0.1*0.4 = 0.07 + 0.04 + 0.04 = 0.15\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the probability that it will be Rainy exactly two days from now is 15%.\n\nBut to express this as a percentage, it's 15%.\n\nAlternatively, as a fraction, it's 3/20 or 0.15.\n\nSo, the final answer is 15%.\n\nBut let me think again if there's another way to model this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the transition probabilities are not the same each day, but the problem gives the transition probabilities"

Hmm, okay. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, today is Sunny. So, I should look at the transition probabilities from Sunny to tomorrow and beyond. The problem gives me the probabilities for the next day based on today's weather. Specifically, if today is Sunny, tomorrow has a 70% chance of being Sunny, 20% Cloudy, and 10% Rainy. So, tomorrow, two days from today, depends on what happens tomorrow.\n\nWait, no, actually, the question is about two days from today, which means we have to consider the next day (tomorrow) and then the day after tomorrow. So, it's a two-step process. Maybe I can model this using probability transitions.\n\nLet me visualize this as a Markov chain. Today is Sunny, so tomorrow has a 70% chance of being Sunny, 20% Cloudy, and 10% Rainy. Then, depending on what tomorrow's weather is, the day after tomorrow (two days from today) will have different probabilities.\n\nSo, to find the total probability of Rainy two days from today, I need to consider all possible paths that lead to Rainy on the second day. That is, tomorrow could be Sunny, Cloudy, or Rainy, and from each of those, the day after tomorrow could be Rainy.\n\nTherefore, I should calculate the probability of each possible tomorrow's weather and then multiply each by the probability that the day after tomorrow is Rainy given tomorrow's weather. Then, sum all those probabilities.\n\nLet me write down the given probabilities:\n\n- Today: Sunny\n- Tomorrow:\n  - Sunny: 70% (0.7)\n  - Cloudy: 20% (0.2)\n  - Rainy: 10% (0.1)\n  \n- If tomorrow is Sunny:\n  - Day after tomorrow: Rainy 20% (0.2)\n  \n- If tomorrow is Cloudy:\n  - Day after tomorrow: Rainy 20% (0.2)\n  \n- If tomorrow is Rainy:\n  - Day after tomorrow: Rainy 40% (0.4)\n\nWait, let me check the given data again. If today is Rainy, tomorrow has a 40% chance of being Rainy, 40% Cloudy, and 20% Sunny. But in our case, tomorrow can't be Rainy unless today is Rainy, which it isn't. Wait, no, actually, tomorrow can be Rainy regardless of today's weather, based on the transition probabilities. So, tomorrow's weather is independent of today's, given the transition probabilities.\n\nSo, regardless of today being Sunny, tomorrow has its own transition probabilities. So, tomorrow can be Sunny, Cloudy, or Rainy with the given probabilities, and from each of those, the day after tomorrow has its own probabilities.\n\nTherefore, to get the probability of Rainy two days from today, I need to consider:\n\nP(Today=Sun) * P(Tomorrow=Sun) * P(2nd day=Rain | Tomorrow=Sun) +\n\nP(Today=Sun) * P(Tomorrow=Cloudy) * P(2nd day=Rain | Tomorrow=Cloudy) +\n\nP(Today=Sun) * P(Tomorrow=Rain) * P(2nd day=Rain | Tomorrow=Rain)\n\nBut since today is definitely Sunny, it's just the sum of the three paths:\n\n0.7 * 0.2 + 0.2 * 0.2 + 0.1 * 0.4\n\nWait, let me compute that:\n\nFirst term: 0.7 (tomorrow is Sunny) * 0.2 (day after tomorrow is Rainy) = 0.14\n\nSecond term: 0.2 (tomorrow is Cloudy) * 0.2 (day after tomorrow is Rainy) = 0.04\n\nThird term: 0.1 (tomorrow is Rainy) * 0.4 (day after tomorrow is Rainy) = 0.04\n\nAdding them up: 0.14 + 0.04 + 0.04 = 0.22\n\nSo, the probability is 22%.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as the total probability of Rainy two days from today given today is Sunny is equal to the sum over all possible intermediate days (tomorrow) of the probability of today being Sunny, tomorrow being that day, and then the day after being Rainy.\n\nYes, that's exactly what I did. So, 0.7*0.2 + 0.2*0.2 + 0.1*0.4 = 0.14 + 0.04 + 0.04 = 0.22.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 22%, or 0.22.\n\nI think that's the correct answer. So, the probability that it will be Rainy exactly two days from now is 22%.\n</think>\n\nThe probability that it will be Rainy exactly two days from now is calculated by considering all possible paths from today (Sunny) to tomorrow and then to the day after tomorrow. Each path's probability is the product of the transition probabilities, and their sum gives the total probability.\n\n- Today: Sunny (100%)\n- Tomorrow:\n  - Sunny: 70% (0.7)\n  - Cloudy: 20% (0.2)\n  - Rainy: 10% (0.1)\n- Day after tomorrow:\n  - If tomorrow is Sunny: 20% Rainy (0.2)\n  - If tomorrow is Cloudy: 20% Rainy (0.2)\n  - If tomorrow is Rainy: 40% Rainy (0.4)\n\nCalculating each path:\n- Sunny \u2192 Sunny \u2192 Rainy: 0.7 * 0.2 = 0.14\n- Sunny \u2192 Cloudy \u2192 Rainy: 0.2 * 0.2 = 0.04\n- Sunny \u2192 Rainy \u2192 Rainy: 0.1 * 0.4 = 0.04\n\nSumming these probabilities: 0.14 + 0.04 + 0.04 = 0.22\n\n**Answer:** The probability is 22%, so it will be Rainy exactly two days from now with a probability of 22%.\n\nDONE."

    "solution": "Solve this problem step by step. End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: A weather station categorizes each day as either 'Sunny', 'Cloudy', or 'Rainy'. Based on historical data, if today is Sunny, then tomorrow has a 70% chance of being Sunny, a 20% chance of being Cloudy, and a 10% chance of being Rainy. If today is Cloudy, then tomorrow has a 50% chance of being Cloudy, a 30% chance of being Sunny, and a 20% chance of being Rainy. If today is Rainy, then tomorrow has a 40% chance of being Rainy, a 40% chance of being Cloudy, and a 20% chance of being Sunny. If today is Sunny, what is the probability that it will be Rainy exactly 2 days from now? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out the probability that it will be Rainy exactly two days from today, given that today is Sunny. Hmm, okay. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the weather station categorizes each day as 'Sunny', 'Cloudy', or 'Rainy'. They've provided transition probabilities from one day to the next based on today's weather. Specifically, if today is Sunny, tomorrow has a 70% chance of being Sunny, 20% Cloudy, and 10% Rainy. If today is Cloudy, tomorrow has a 50% chance of Cloudy, 30% Sunny, and 20% Rainy. And if today is Rainy, tomorrow has a 40% chance of Rainy, 40% Cloudy, and 20% Sunny.\n\nSo, today is Sunny, and I need to find the probability that two days from today, it will be Rainy. That means I need to consider what the weather will be tomorrow, and then what it will be the day after tomorrow, and sum up the probabilities where it's Rainy on the second day.\n\nLet me break it down:\n\n1. Today is Sunny. So, tomorrow's weather depends on the transition probabilities from Sunny.\n2. From Sunny, tomorrow has a 10% chance of being Rainy. So, the first day after today (tomorrow) is Rainy with probability 0.10.\n3. If tomorrow is Rainy, what is the probability that the day after tomorrow (two days from today) is Rainy? Well, if today is Rainy, the day after tomorrow has a 40% chance of being Rainy. So, the probability from Rainy to Rainy is 0.40.\n4. So, the combined probability is the probability that tomorrow is Rainy AND the day after is Rainy. Since these are independent events (the weather today doesn't affect the weather two days from now directly, only through intermediate days), we can multiply the probabilities.\n\nLet me write this out step by step:\n\n- P(Tomorrow is Rainy | Today is Sunny) = 0.10\n- P(Today is Rainy) = 0.10\n- P(Tomorrow is Rainy and Day After Tomorrow is Rainy) = P(Tomorrow is Rainy | Today is Sunny) * P(Today is Rainy | Tomorrow is Rainy) * P(Today is Rainy) ?\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Let me correct that.\n\nActually, to find the probability that two days from today is Rainy, we need to consider all possible paths that lead to Rainy two days from today. Since each day's weather depends only on the previous day, we can model this as a Markov chain.\n\nSo, starting from today (Sunny), we go to tomorrow, which can be Sunny, Cloudy, or Rainy. Then from tomorrow, we go to the day after tomorrow, which again can be Sunny, Cloudy, or Rainy. We need to consider all possible paths where the day after tomorrow is Rainy.\n\nGiven that, let's outline the possible paths:\n\n1. Today: Sunny\n   - Tomorrow: Sunny (70%)\n     - Day After Tomorrow: Rainy (20%)\n   - Tomorrow: Cloudy (20%)\n     - Day After Tomorrow: Rainy (20%)\n   - Tomorrow: Rainy (10%)\n     - Day After Tomorrow: Rainy (40%)\n\nWait, no. The day after tomorrow's probabilities depend on tomorrow's weather, not today's. So, from tomorrow's state, we have different probabilities for the day after tomorrow.\n\nSo, more accurately:\n\n- Today: Sunny\n- Tomorrow: Sunny (70%)\n  - Day After Tomorrow: Sunny (from tomorrow being Sunny), Rainy (20%), Cloudy (20%)\n- Tomorrow: Cloudy (20%)\n  - Day After Tomorrow: Sunny (30%), Cloudy (50%), Rainy (20%)\n- Tomorrow: Rainy (10%)\n  - Day After Tomorrow: Sunny (20%), Cloudy (40%), Rainy (40%)\n\nBut we only care about the cases where the day after tomorrow is Rainy. So, let's identify all the paths that result in Rainy two days from today.\n\n1. Today: Sunny\n   - Tomorrow: Sunny (70%)\n     - Day After Tomorrow: Rainy (20%)\n   - Tomorrow: Cloudy (20%)\n     - Day After Tomorrow: Rainy (20%)\n   - Tomorrow: Rainy (10%)\n     - Day After Tomorrow: Rainy (40%)\n\nSo, these are the three paths that lead to Rainy two days from today.\n\nNow, let's calculate the probability for each path:\n\n1. Sunny -> Sunny -> Rainy\n   - Probability: 0.70 (from Sunny to Sunny) * 0.20 (from Sunny to Rainy) = 0.70 * 0.20 = 0.14\n2. Sunny -> Cloudy -> Rainy\n   - Probability: 0.20 (from Sunny to Cloudy) * 0.20 (from Cloudy to Rainy) = 0.20 * 0.20 = 0.04\n3. Sunny -> Rainy -> Rainy\n   - Probability: 0.10 (from Sunny to Rainy) * 0.40 (from Rainy to Rainy) = 0.10 * 0.40 = 0.04\n\nNow, sum these probabilities to get the total probability that two days from today it will be Rainy:\n\n0.14 + 0.04 + 0.04 = 0.22\n\nSo, the probability is 22%.\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst path: Sunny -> Sunny -> Rainy. 0.7 * 0.2 = 0.14. Correct.\n\nSecond path: Sunny -> Cloudy -> Rainy. 0.2 * 0.2 = 0.04. Correct.\n\nThird path: Sunny -> Rainy -> Rainy. 0.1 * 0.4 = 0.04. Correct.\n\nAdding them up: 0.14 + 0.04 + 0.04 = 0.22. So, 22%.\n\nHmm, that seems straightforward. Is there another way to approach this problem?\n\nAlternatively, we could model this using matrices or transition matrices, but since it's only two days, enumerating the paths is manageable.\n\nAnother way is to consider that the day after tomorrow's weather depends on tomorrow's weather, which in turn depends on today's. So, the joint probability can be calculated by considering all possible tomorrow's weather and then the day after tomorrow's given that.\n\nMathematically, we can express it as:\n\nP(Rainy two days from now | Sunny today) = \u03a3 [P(Tomorrow = X) * P(Next day = Rainy | Tomorrow = X)] for X in {Sunny, Cloudy, Rainy}\n\nBut actually, since we're considering the day after tomorrow, it's better to condition on tomorrow's state.\n\nSo, the correct way is:\n\nP(Rainy two days from now | Sunny today) = \u03a3 [P(Tomorrow = X) * P(Next day = Rainy | Tomorrow = X)] where X is Sunny, Cloudy, Rainy.\n\nBut wait, no, that's not quite right. Because the day after tomorrow's state depends on tomorrow's state, which is a separate variable.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- Let T be tomorrow's state.\n- Let T2 be the day after tomorrow's state.\n\nWe need to find P(T2 = Rainy | Today = Sunny)\n\nBy the law of total probability, this is equal to:\n\n\u03a3 [P(T2 = Rainy | Today = Sunny, T = X) * P(T = X | Today = Sunny)] for X in {Sunny, Cloudy, Rainy}\n\nBut actually, since T2 depends only on T, not on Today, we can write:\n\nP(T2 = Rainy | Today = Sunny) = \u03a3 [P(T2 = Rainy | T = X) * P(T = X | Today = Sunny)] for X in {Sunny, Cloudy, Rainy}\n\nYes, that's correct. So, we need to compute P(T2 = Rainy | T = Sunny), P(T2 = Rainy | T = Cloudy), and P(T2 = Rainy | T = Rainy), then multiply each by the probability of T being in that state given Today is Sunny, and sum them up.\n\nSo, let's compute each term:\n\n1. P(T2 = Rainy | T = Sunny) = 0.20\n2. P(T2 = Rainy | T = Cloudy) = 0.20\n3. P(T2 = Rainy | T = Rainy) = 0.40\n\nNow, P(T = X | Today = Sunny) are the transition probabilities from Sunny to X, which are:\n\n- P(T = Sunny | Today = Sunny) = 0.70\n- P(T = Cloudy | Today = Sunny) = 0.20\n- P(T = Rainy | Today = Sunny) = 0.10\n\nSo, now plug these into the total probability:\n\nP(T2 = Rainy | Today = Sunny) = (0.20 * 0.70) + (0.20 * 0.20) + (0.40 * 0.10)\n\nCompute each term:\n\n- 0.20 * 0.70 = 0.14\n- 0.20 * 0.20 = 0.04\n- 0.40 * 0.10 = 0.04\n\nAdding them up: 0.14 + 0.04 + 0.04 = 0.22\n\nSo, again, we get 0.22 or 22%.\n\nTherefore, the probability that it will be Rainy exactly two days from now, given that today is Sunny, is 22%.\n\nI think that's solid. I've approached it two different ways, both leading to the same result, so I'm confident.\n</think>\n\nThe probability that it will be Rainy exactly two days from today, given that today is Sunny, is 22%.\n\n**Answer:** The probability is 22%, so the answer is \\boxed{0.22}.\n\nDONE."
