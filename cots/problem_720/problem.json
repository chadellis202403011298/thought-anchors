  "question": "A weather station categorizes each day as either 'Sunny', 'Cloudy', or 'Rainy'. Based on historical data, if today is Sunny, then tomorrow has a 70% chance of being Sunny, a 20% chance of being Cloudy, and a 10% chance of being Rainy. If today is Cloudy, then tomorrow has a 50% chance of being Cloudy, a 30% chance of being Sunny, and a 20% chance of being Rainy. If today is Rainy, then tomorrow has a 40% chance of being Rainy, a 40% chance of being Cloudy, and a 20% chance of being Sunny. If today is Sunny, what is the probability that it will be Rainy exactly 2 days from now?",
  "answer": "To solve this problem, we need to find the probability of transitioning from Sunny to Rainy in exactly 2 days.\n\nLet's denote the states as S (Sunny), C (Cloudy), and R (Rainy).\n\nTo get from S to R in exactly 2 days, we need to consider all possible intermediate states on day 1:\n\n1. S \u2192 S \u2192 R: Start at Sunny, go to Sunny, then go to Rainy\n2. S \u2192 C \u2192 R: Start at Sunny, go to Cloudy, then go to Rainy\n3. S \u2192 R \u2192 R: Start at Sunny, go to Rainy, then go to Rainy\n\nLet's calculate the probability of each path:\n\nPath 1: S \u2192 S \u2192 R\nP(S \u2192 S) = 0.70 (probability of Sunny \u2192 Sunny)\nP(S \u2192 R) = 0.10 (probability of Sunny \u2192 Rainy)\nP(S \u2192 S \u2192 R) = 0.70 \u00d7 0.10 = 0.07\n\nPath 2: S \u2192 C \u2192 R\nP(S \u2192 C) = 0.20 (probability of Sunny \u2192 Cloudy)\nP(C \u2192 R) = 0.20 (probability of Cloudy \u2192 Rainy)\nP(S \u2192 C \u2192 R) = 0.20 \u00d7 0.20 = 0.04\n\nPath 3: S \u2192 R \u2192 R\nP(S \u2192 R) = 0.10 (probability of Sunny \u2192 Rainy)\nP(R \u2192 R) = 0.40 (probability of Rainy \u2192 Rainy)\nP(S \u2192 R \u2192 R) = 0.10 \u00d7 0.40 = 0.04\n\nThe total probability is the sum of these three path probabilities:\nP(Rainy 2 days from now | Sunny today) = 0.07 + 0.04 + 0.04 = 0.15 or 15%\n\nTherefore, if today is Sunny, the probability that it will be Rainy exactly 2 days from now is 15%."
