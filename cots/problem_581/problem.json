  "answer": "Step 1: Let's define what we're trying to count. Consider a set S with n elements.\n\nStep 2: The left side of the equation, \u03a3\u1d4f\u208c\u2080\u207f C(n,k), represents the sum of all possible ways to select k elements from the set S, where k ranges from 0 to n.\n\nStep 3: C(n,0) counts the number of ways to select 0 elements from S, which is 1 way (the empty set).\nC(n,1) counts the number of ways to select 1 element from S, which is n ways.\nC(n,2) counts the number of ways to select 2 elements from S.\nAnd so on, until C(n,n), which counts the number of ways to select all n elements, which is 1 way.\n\nStep 4: So \u03a3\u1d4f\u208c\u2080\u207f C(n,k) counts the total number of all possible subsets of S, including the empty set and the set S itself.\n\nStep 5: Now, let's count the total number of subsets of S in a different way. For each element in S, we have two choices: either include it in our subset or exclude it. Since we have n elements and 2 independent choices for each element, by the multiplication principle, the total number of different subsets is 2\u207f.\n\nStep 6: Since both counting methods enumerated the same set (all possible subsets of S), the results must be equal. Therefore, \u03a3\u1d4f\u208c\u2080\u207f C(n,k) = 2\u207f."
