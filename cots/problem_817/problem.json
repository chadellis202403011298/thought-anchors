  "question": "A woman walks into a restaurant and orders albatross soup. After taking one sip, she immediately realizes what it is, leaves the restaurant, goes home, and commits suicide. Why did she kill herself?",
  "answer": "The woman had been stranded on a deserted island years ago with her husband and several other survivors after a shipwreck. During their time there, her husband died. One of the other survivors made soup for her, claiming it was albatross meat. She survived and was eventually rescued. Years later, at the restaurant, when she tasted real albatross soup for the first time, she immediately recognized that what she had eaten on the island couldn't have been albatross. This realization led her to the horrifying conclusion that she had actually consumed her dead husband's flesh, served to her by the other survivors. Overwhelmed by this trauma, she took her own life.\n\nThis problem requires perspective shifting because the initial scenario seems puzzling and disconnected - why would tasting soup lead to suicide? The solution requires looking beyond the immediate scenario and considering a completely different context (the past shipwreck) that isn't explicitly mentioned. By shifting perspectives from the present to the past, and considering how the taste of the soup might connect these two time periods, we can arrive at the logical explanation."
