  "question": "A man lives on the 10th floor of an apartment building. Every morning he takes the elevator down to the ground floor to go to work. When he returns in the evening, he takes the elevator to the 7th floor and walks up the stairs for the remaining three floors to reach his apartment. However, on rainy days, he takes the elevator all the way to the 10th floor. Why does he only take the elevator to the 7th floor on non-rainy days?",
  "answer": "The man is of short stature (he is a little person or has dwarfism). He can reach the buttons for floors 1-7 in the elevator, but cannot reach higher than the 7th floor button. On rainy days, he carries an umbrella, which he can use to press the 10th floor button. On non-rainy days, without the umbrella, he can only press the button for the 7th floor and must walk up the remaining three flights of stairs.\n\nThis problem requires lateral thinking because the conventional approach would be to look for reasons related to exercise, social interactions, or building rules. The metaphorical aspect involves seeing the umbrella not just as protection from rain but as a tool that extends the man's reach\u2014literally and figuratively overcoming his limitations."
