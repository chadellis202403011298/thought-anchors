  "question": "A factory operates three machines in sequence: Machine A, Machine B, and Machine C. When the final product is inspected, it is found to have a defect. The quality control team reports the following information:\n\n1. If Machine A malfunctions, it always causes Machine B to malfunction as well.\n2. If Machine B malfunctions, the final product will always have a defect.\n3. Machine C is operating normally.\n4. Sometimes Machine B can malfunction on its own, even if Machine A is working properly.\n\nBased on this information, which of the following statements must be true?\n\nA) Machine A must have malfunctioned.\nB) Machine B must have malfunctioned.\nC) Either Machine A or Machine B (or both) must have malfunctioned.\nD) If Machine A malfunctioned, then the defect was definitely caused by that initial malfunction.",
  "answer": "The correct answer is B) Machine B must have malfunctioned.\n\nLet's analyze this step by step using causal reasoning:\n\n1. We know the final product has a defect.\n\n2. According to statement #2, \"If Machine B malfunctions, the final product will always have a defect.\" This is a direct causal relationship. \n\n3. We can rewrite this as: Machine B malfunction \u2192 Product defect\n\n4. When we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and we know Q is true, we cannot conclude that P is true (this would be the fallacy of affirming the consequent). However, our statement #2 is stronger - it says Machine B malfunction ALWAYS causes a product defect.\n\n5. Since we know there is a product defect, and the only reported cause of product defects is Machine B malfunctioning, we must conclude that Machine B malfunctioned.\n\n6. Option A is incorrect because even though Machine A's malfunction leads to Machine B's malfunction, statement #4 tells us that Machine B can malfunction independently.\n\n7. Option C is true but not as specific as option B. When we have evidence that directly indicates B is true, choosing the more specific statement (B) is more appropriate than choosing the less specific statement (C).\n\n8. Option D is incorrect because even if Machine A malfunctioned, the defect is directly caused by Machine B's malfunction, not Machine A's (though Machine A may have started the causal chain in some cases).\n\nTherefore, the only statement that must be true is B) Machine B must have malfunctioned."
