  "question": "A high school student wants to determine if a certain plant food affects the growth rate of tomato plants. She has 10 identical tomato seedlings of the same variety. She designs an experiment where she gives 5 seedlings the plant food mixed with water, while the other 5 seedlings receive only water. After 4 weeks, she measures the height of all plants. The plants receiving the plant food grew an average of 12 cm, while those receiving only water grew an average of 8 cm. \n\nIdentify at least three variables that the student correctly controlled in this experiment, and explain one additional variable she should control to make her experiment more scientifically valid.",
  "answer": "The student correctly controlled the following variables in her experiment:\n\n1. Plant type: All seedlings were tomato plants of the same variety, ensuring that any difference in growth wasn't due to different plant species or varieties.\n\n2. Initial plant condition: All seedlings started as identical tomato seedlings, controlling for initial size or health differences.\n\n3. Number of plants in each group: She used the same number of plants (5) in each group, which controls for sample size effects.\n\n4. Duration of the experiment: Both groups were measured after the same time period (4 weeks).\n\nOne additional variable the student should control to make her experiment more scientifically valid is the environmental conditions for all plants. Specifically, she should ensure that all plants receive the same amount of sunlight, are kept at the same temperature, and are in the same type of soil. If plants in one group receive more sunlight or are kept in a warmer location than the other group, this could affect growth independently of the plant food treatment. By controlling these environmental variables, she can be more confident that any observed differences in growth are due to the plant food rather than environmental variations."
