She has 10 identical tomato seedlings of the same variety. She designs an experiment where she gives 5 seedlings the plant food mixed with water, while the other 5 seedlings receive only water. After 4 weeks, she measures the height of all plants. The plants receiving the plant food grew an average of 12 cm, while those receiving only water grew an average of 8 cm. \n\nIdentify at least three variables that the student correctly controlled in this experiment, and explain one additional variable she should control to make her experiment more scientifically valid. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to help this high school student figure out her experiment on plant food and tomato growth. Let me break this down step by step. First, I need to understand what she did. She has 10 identical tomato seedlings, divided them into two groups of 5. One group gets the plant food mixed with water, the other only water. After four weeks, she measures their heights. The treated plants grew 12 cm on average, and the controls grew 8 cm. \n\nOkay, now the question is about identifying the variables she controlled correctly and suggesting an additional one to make the experiment more valid. Let me think about variables in experiments. There are independent variables, dependent variables, and control variables. \n\nSo, in this case, the independent variable is the plant food versus water. The dependent variable is the height of the plants. The control variables are the things she kept the same across all groups to eliminate their effects. \n\nWhat are the control variables here? Well, she used identical seedlings, so the genetic makeup is the same. She probably kept the environment the same\u2014like same light, temperature, water availability, except for the treatment. The soil might be another factor, but if she used the same soil for both groups, that's controlled. \n\nWait, she mentioned she gave them plant food mixed with water and the others only water. So, the concentration of the plant food is another variable, but she probably kept it consistent across the treated group. \n\nSo, she controlled the genotype (all same seedlings), the environmental factors (light, temperature, water\u2014though water is part of the treatment), the soil (assuming same for both), and the application method (same for both groups). \n\nNow, to think about an additional variable she should control. Hmm. One thing that comes to mind is the amount of water each plant received. Because the treated group gets plant food mixed with water, but if the water amount is different, that could affect growth. Maybe she should measure and ensure that both groups got the same amount of water. Otherwise, the difference in water could influence the results. \n\nAlternatively, she could control for the type of fertilizer or its concentration, but she already gave the same treatment to all in her group. Wait, no, the plant food is the variable, so that's intentional. \n\nAnother thought: nutrients besides what's in the plant food. Maybe the soil had different nutrients. But she controlled the soil, so that's fine. \n\nWait, she might have controlled the number of plants, but she used 10, 5 each. So, sample size is controlled, but that's more about the experiment's size, not a variable. \n\nSo, the main variables she controlled are: genotype, environment (light, temperature, etc.), soil, and application method. An additional variable she should control is the amount of water each plant receives. Because in the treatment, she's giving plant food with water, but if the control group gets only water, maybe the amount of water is the same. But if she didn't measure it, maybe the treated plants got more water, which could affect growth. \n\nTherefore, she should measure and ensure that both groups received the same amount of water. That way, the only difference is the plant food. This would make the experiment more scientifically valid because it controls for another variable that might have influenced the results.\n\nSo, to sum up, the controlled variables are genotype, environment, soil, and application method. She should also control for the amount of water each plant gets.\n</think>\n\nThe student correctly controlled several variables in her experiment, including:\n\n1. **Genotype**: All seedlings were identical, ensuring that genetic factors don't interfere with the results.\n2. **Environmental Factors**: She maintained consistent light, temperature, and general growing conditions for both groups.\n3. **Soil Type**: The soil used for both groups was the same, preventing differences in soil quality from affecting growth.\n4. **Application Method**: The plant food was applied in the same manner to all treated seedlings, avoiding variability in treatment application.\n\nTo enhance the experiment's validity, she should also control for the **amount of water each plant receives**. This ensures that differences in growth aren't due to variations in water intake.\n\nDONE."

She has 10 identical tomato seedlings of the same variety. She designs an experiment where she gives 5 seedlings the plant food mixed with water, while the other 5 seedlings receive only water. After 4 weeks, she measures the height of all plants. The plants receiving the plant food grew an average of 12 cm, while those receiving only water grew an average of 8 cm. \n\nIdentify at least three variables that the student correctly controlled in this experiment, and explain one additional variable she should control to make her experiment more scientifically valid. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the variables the student controlled and what she should control next. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, the experiment is about determining if a plant food affects tomato plant growth. The student has 10 identical seedlings, which is good because that reduces variability. She splits them into two groups: 5 get plant food mixed with water, and 5 get only water. After 4 weeks, she measures their heights.\n\nSo, the main variables here are treatment (plant food vs. water) and the outcome, which is height. But she also needs to control other variables to make sure the results are valid.\n\nLet me list the variables she controlled. Well, she used identical seedlings, so that's a good start\u2014genetic variability is minimized. They all have the same variety, so that's another controlled variable: the type of tomato plant. That makes sense because if they were different varieties, the results might be influenced by different growth rates.\n\nEnvironmental factors are important too. She must have controlled things like light, temperature, and water availability. If one group got more water, that could affect growth, but she gave both groups the same amount\u2014plant food mixed with water and regular water. Wait, but the plant food might have nutrients that promote growth beyond just water. So, she probably controlled the amount of water each plant gets. Also, light and temperature should be consistent for both groups to ensure that environmental conditions aren't affecting the results.\n\nAnother variable is the time of measurement. She measured after exactly 4 weeks, so that's controlled. If she measured at different times, the results might vary due to growth patterns over time.\n\nNow, what additional variable should she control? Well, perhaps the amount of plant food. She gave 5 plants plant food mixed with water, but how much plant food was that? If the concentration varies, that could skew the results. Maybe she should measure and control the exact concentration of plant food in the solution to ensure that's the only variable changing.\n\nWait, but she used the same solution for all 5 plants, so maybe that's already controlled. Hmm. Alternatively, she could control the soil type or fertilization. But since she's only adding plant food, maybe that's already accounted for.\n\nAnother thought: she could control the method of application. Are the plant foods applied the same way each time, like via watering? If she used different methods, that could affect growth. But she just mixed it with water, so that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, she could control the timing of when the plant food was applied relative to their growth cycle. Maybe she should apply it at the same growth stage for all plants.\n\nWait, maybe the amount of plant food is the key. If she used different amounts, even unintentionally, that could affect growth. So she should measure and control the exact amount of plant food administered per plant. That way, she can ensure that the only variable is the presence of the plant food, not the quantity.\n\nI think that's a good point. She should record the exact amount of plant food used per plant so that she can factor that into her calculations and confirm it's the concentration, not the quantity, that affects growth.\n\nSo, to sum up, she controlled the genetic makeup, environmental factors, measurement time, and possibly the method of application. She should also control the concentration of plant food to ensure it's a controlled variable.\n</think>\n\nThe student effectively controlled several variables in her experiment to ensure valid results. She used identical tomato seedlings of the same variety, which minimizes genetic variability. She maintained consistent environmental conditions, including light, temperature, and water quantity, for both groups. The experiment was conducted over the same time period, ensuring that measurements were taken at the same growth stage. \n\nTo enhance the experiment's validity, she should control the concentration of plant food administered. This ensures that the variable affecting growth is the presence of plant food itself, not the amount applied. By measuring and standardizing this concentration, she can isolate the treatment's effect accurately.\n\nDONE."

Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nThe student has 10 tomato seedlings. She splits them into two groups: 5 get plant food mixed with water, and 5 get only water. She grows them for 4 weeks, measures their heights, and finds that the plant food group grew an average of 12 cm, while the water-only group grew 8 cm. \n\nFirst, I should identify the variables she controlled correctly. Variables are the factors she manipulated or measured in the experiment. \n\n1. **Number of Seedlings**: She used 10 seedlings, which is a good start because it allows her to have equal numbers in both groups. If she had unequal numbers, it might affect the results. By having 5 in each, she can compare them fairly.\n\n2. **Plant Food vs. Water Only**: She gave one group plant food and the other only water. This is a clear independent variable because it's the main thing she's testing\u2014the effect of the plant food on growth.\n\n3. **Controlled Environment**: She probably kept the environmental factors constant, like temperature, light, and water availability, except for the plant food. If these weren't controlled, other variables could influence the results. For example, if one group got more water than the other, that would skew the results. By keeping the environment the same, she can isolate the effect of the plant food.\n\nNow, what's missing? \n\nShe measured the height after 4 weeks, which is good. But she didn't measure the height at the start. What if some seedlings were naturally taller or shorter? Without knowing the initial height, she can't be sure that the growth difference is entirely due to the plant food. \n\nFor example, if the seedlings in the plant food group were actually taller before the experiment, their growth could be natural, not because of the food. So, she should measure the initial height of all seedlings before applying the treatment. This way, she can see if the growth is due to the treatment or just the plants' natural differences.\n\nAdditionally, she should randomize which seedlings get which treatment. If she just assigns them arbitrarily, there might be an unintended pattern that affects the results. Random assignment helps ensure that the two groups are similar in all aspects except for the treatment.\n\nWait, did she actually randomize? The problem doesn't say, so maybe that's another thing she should have controlled.\n\nSo, to sum up, she controlled the number of seedlings, the treatment (plant food vs. water), and the environment. She should also measure initial height and randomize the assignment to strengthen her experiment.\n</think>\n\nThe student effectively controlled several variables in her experiment, contributing to its validity. Here's a breakdown:\n\n1. **Number of Seedlings**: She used 10, ensuring equal distribution between treatment groups, which is crucial for fair comparison.\n\n2. **Independent Variable**: The plant food vs. water only setup clearly tests the main hypothesis about growth impact.\n\n3. **Controlled Environment**: Maintaining consistent environmental factors like light and temperature minimizes external influences on growth.\n\n**Additional Controls Needed:**\n- **Initial Height Measurement**: Measuring seedlings' heights at the start ensures that growth differences aren't due to initial plant variations.\n- **Randomization**: Randomly assigning seedlings to groups prevents unintended patterns that could skew results.\n\nBy implementing these controls, the experiment's results would be more reliable and scientifically valid.\n\nDONE."

Let me start by understanding the problem. She has 10 identical tomato seedlings. She divides them into two groups: 5 get plant food mixed with water, and 5 get only water. After 4 weeks, she measures their heights. The plant food group grew an average of 12 cm, while the water-only group grew 8 cm. \n\nNow, the question is about identifying the variables she controlled correctly and suggesting an additional variable she should control to make the experiment more valid. \n\nFirst, let's recall what variables are involved in an experiment. There are independent variables, dependent variables, and control variables. In this case, the independent variable is the plant food vs. water. The dependent variable is the height of the plants. Control variables are the factors that are kept constant to reduce variability.\n\nSo, the student controlled several variables. Let's list them:\n\n1. **Seeding Conditions**: All seedlings are identical, so factors like soil type, sunlight exposure, temperature, and humidity during seeding should be the same for both groups. If these weren't controlled, it could affect the results.\n\n2. **Planting Conditions**: The seedlings are planted in the same environment. This includes the type of pot, soil quality, whether they're in a greenhouse or outdoors, and how they're spaced. Any differences here could influence growth.\n\n3. **Watering Technique**: She mentioned mixing plant food with water for one group. The other group gets only water. It's important that both groups receive the same amount of water, or else it could skew the results. If she didn't control the amount of water, like maybe one group got more water than the other, that would affect growth.\n\n4. **Environmental Factors**: Factors like light, temperature, and humidity during the 4 weeks after planting. If, for example, one group got more sunlight, that would affect growth rates. So, controlling for consistent environmental conditions is crucial.\n\nNow, for the additional variable she should control: \n\nI think **the amount of plant food** isn't mentioned, but she already used it. Wait, no, she did give them plant food mixed with water. So maybe she needs to control the concentration of the plant food. If she didn't standardize the concentration, maybe one group got a higher concentration than the other, which would affect growth differently. So, she should measure and ensure that the concentration is the same in both groups.\n\nWait, but she already gave them plant food mixed with water, so maybe she needs to control the dosage or concentration. If she didn't, the effect might not be solely due to the presence of the food but also due to varying concentrations.\n\nAlternatively, she could have another control variable like the type of plant food or the method of application, but I think the concentration is a better fit here.\n\nSo, in summary, she controlled seeding, planting conditions, watering, and environment. She should also control the concentration of the plant food.\n</think>\n\nThe student effectively controlled several variables in her experiment, ensuring consistency between the treatment groups. She maintained identical seeding conditions, planted the seedlings in the same environment, and applied water uniformly. Additionally, she controlled the environmental factors that could influence growth. To enhance the experiment's validity, she should also standardize the concentration of the plant food to ensure that the effect observed is due solely to the presence of the food and not varying concentrations. \n\nDONE."

She wants to see if this plant food affects the growth rate of tomato plants. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, she has 10 identical tomato seedlings. Identical means they're the same variety, so they should have the same genetic makeup and similar growing conditions. That's a good start because it reduces variables related to the plant's genetics and environment.\n\nShe divides them into two groups: 5 seedlings get plant food mixed with water, and the other 5 get only water. So, she's using a control group (water) and a treatment group (plant food). That makes sense because she's comparing two conditions.\n\nAfter 4 weeks, she measures the height of all plants. The plants with plant food grew an average of 12 cm, while the water-only plants grew 8 cm. So, there's a significant difference in height, suggesting the plant food might be effective.\n\nNow, the question is about the variables she controlled correctly and an additional one she should control. Let's see.\n\nVariables controlled:\n\n1. **Plant Variety**: All seedlings are identical, so the variety is the same. If they were different, it could affect growth rates due to genetic differences.\n\n2. **Light and Water**: Assuming the environment is controlled, like having the same amount of light and water for all. If one group got more light or water, that could skew results.\n\n3. **Temperature**: Similar environmental conditions regarding temperature. If one group was in a different climate, that could influence growth.\n\n4. **Pest Control**: All plants should be free from pests or diseases. If one group had more pests, it might not grow as tall.\n\n5. **Soil Type**: They should all be in the same soil type. Different soils could affect growth.\n\nAn additional variable she should control is **Nutrient Levels**: Even though she's testing plant food, she should ensure both groups have the same levels of other nutrients like magnesium or potassium. If the plant food somehow interfered with other nutrients, it could affect growth. Maybe she can use a balanced fertilizer in both treatments to control for that.\n\nWait, but the plant food is the only variable here. So maybe she should also ensure that the plant food doesn't contain any unintended nutrients that could confound the results. Alternatively, she could use a balanced diet for both groups to isolate the effect of the plant food.\n\nAnother thought: she should also monitor the amount of water each plant gets. If one group got more water than the other, that could influence growth. But she used the same solution for both, so that's controlled. Still, maybe measuring the exact amount each plant received would be better.\n\nSo, to sum up, she controlled plant variety, environment, soil, and pest control. She should also ensure that both groups have the same level of other nutrients to isolate the effect of the plant food.\n</think>\n\nThe student correctly controlled several variables in her experiment, including the plant variety, environmental conditions such as light and temperature, soil type, and pest control. To make her experiment more scientifically valid, she should also control for nutrient levels in both treatment groups to ensure that the plant food's effect isn't confounded by differences in other nutrients. \n\nDONE."

Let me see what she did and what she needs to consider. \n\nAlright, she has 10 tomato seedlings, all the same variety. That's good because it means they should grow similarly under normal conditions. She splits them into two groups: 5 get plant food mixed with water, and 5 get only water. She measures their height after 4 weeks. The plant food group grew an average of 12 cm, while the water-only group grew 8 cm. \n\nNow, she wants to know if the plant food affects growth rate. To do this, she needs to make sure that all other variables are controlled so that any differences in growth are due to the plant food and not something else. \n\nFirst, let's think about the variables she controlled. She used identical seedlings, which is a good start because if they were different, maybe in age or health, that could affect the results. She split them evenly into two groups, 5 each, so the sample size is the same on both sides. That helps in comparing the results fairly.\n\nShe also measured the height after 4 weeks, which is specific timing. If she measured at different times, the results might not be accurate. By keeping the measurement consistent, she can track growth over the same period.\n\nNow, what else should she consider? Well, environmental factors could play a big role. For example, if one group had more sunlight or better drainage, that could affect growth. She should make sure both groups are in the same environment, maybe in the same greenhouse or under the same light conditions.\n\nAnother thing is the nutrients besides the plant food.

She should also control for environmental factors, soil conditions, and initial plant health to make her experiment more valid.\n</think>\n\nThe student correctly controlled several variables in her experiment, such as using identical seedlings, dividing them into equal groups, and measuring height after a consistent time period. However, to enhance the validity of her experiment, she should also consider controlling additional variables like environmental factors, soil conditions, and initial plant health. \n\nBy ensuring that both groups are exposed to the same light, temperature, and soil quality, and checking the initial health of the seedlings, she can minimize external influences and provide a more reliable comparison. \n\nDONE."

Let me start by understanding the setup.\n\nShe has 10 identical tomato seedlings. That's good because it means each plant is the same initially, so any differences in growth should be due to the treatment, not the plants themselves. She splits them into two groups of five: one gets plant food mixed with water, and the other gets just water. She measures their heights after four weeks, and the ones with the plant food grew an average of 12 cm versus 8 cm for the others.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the variables she controlled correctly. Variables are things she manipulated or measured. In this case, she controlled the type of treatment each plant received\u2014either plant food or water. She also controlled the amount of plant food by mixing it with water, so each treated plant got the same concentration. She measured the height of all plants after the same period of time, which is four weeks. That's important because if she had measured at different times, the results might not be comparable.\n\nNow, for the additional variable she should control. Hmm. One thing that comes to mind is the amount of sunlight each plant gets. If some plants got more sunlight than others, that could affect their growth rate. But in this case, since they're all seedlings and presumably in the same environment, maybe that's not a big factor. Another thing is the temperature. If the experiment was conducted in different temperature conditions, that could influence growth. Or maybe the amount of water each plant received, but since she gave them either plant food with water or just water, that's already controlled.\n\nWait, but what about the fertilization? She used plant food, which is like a fertilizer. But maybe she didn't control the type of fertilizer or the concentration. If she varied those, it could affect the results. Or perhaps the nutrients in the plant food\u2014like the ratio of N-P-K or other nutrients. If different fertilizers were used, that could skew the results. But the problem says she mixed plant food with water, so maybe she used the same plant food for all, so that's controlled.\n\nAlternatively, maybe she didn't control for the initial health of the seedlings. But since they're all the same variety and identical, that's probably not an issue. Another variable could be the container size or type. If some plants were in bigger pots or different types of soil, that could affect growth. But the problem says they're identical seedlings, so I assume they were in similar conditions.\n\nWait, but perhaps she didn't control for the number of stems or leaves, but since it's about growth rate, which is height, that's already measured. Maybe the number of times she measured\u2014she only measured once at the end, which is fine.\n\nSo, considering all that, she controlled the treatment, the measurement time, and the environment (since they're all in the same conditions presumably). Now, to make it more valid, she should control the amount of fertilizer or the concentration. Or maybe the type of plant food, like whether it's organic or synthetic, but that's more about treatment.\n\nAlternatively, she should control for the nutrients in the plant food, like ensuring it's the same N-P-K ratio for both groups. Or maybe she didn't control for the water quantity given each plant, but she did give each plant the same amount since it's either plant food with water or just water.\n\nWait, another thought: she didn't control for the initial weight or size of the seedlings. But since they're identical, that's not an issue. Or perhaps she didn't randomize the assignment of plants to treatment groups. If she didn't randomly assign, maybe there's a bias. But the problem doesn't mention that, so I think we can assume random assignment.\n\nSo, to sum up, she controlled the treatment (plant food vs. water), the time of measurement, and the environment. She should also control the concentration or type of plant food to ensure it's the only variable affecting growth.\n</think>\n\nThe student correctly controlled several variables in her experiment. She ensured that the treatments were applied consistently, measuring the height of all plants after the same duration. She also maintained the same environmental conditions for all seedlings, which minimizes external factors. \n\nTo enhance the experiment's validity, she should standardize the concentration of plant food used. This ensures that the growth differences are solely due to the treatment rather than varying levels of nutrients. \n\nDONE."

The student wants to determine if the plant food affects the growth rate. She used 10 identical seedlings, giving 5 plant food mixed with water and the other 5 just water. After 4 weeks, she measured the heights. The treated plants grew 12 cm on average, while the controls grew 8 cm. \n\nOkay, first, I need to identify at least three variables the student correctly controlled. Let me think about what variables could affect plant growth. Well, in plant experiments, variables like light, temperature, water availability, nutrients, and perhaps the timing of measurements are important.\n\nSo, she used identical seedlings, same variety, so genetics is controlled. That's one variable. She gave each plant either the food or water, so the treatment is a variable, but she controlled that by having a control group. So that's another controlled variable.\n\nShe measured the height after 4 weeks. That means she controlled the time of measurement\u2014same for all plants, so time is another controlled variable. So far, that's three: genetics, treatment, and time of measurement.\n\nNow, what else could affect growth? Oh, right, environmental factors like light and temperature. She might have controlled for those, but maybe not explicitly. Or perhaps she didn't, which could be a problem.\n\nWait, the question is about what she did control and what she should control. So she controlled the seedlings' genetics, the treatment (food vs. water), and the time of measurement. But she didn't control for light or temperature. So if her experiment was in different lighting conditions or temperatures, that could affect growth, making her results less clear.\n\nTherefore, she should also control for light and temperature. Maybe she should ensure all plants are in the same light and temperature conditions to make the experiment more valid. That would be an additional variable she should control.\n\nSo in summary, she controlled genetics, treatment, and time. She should also control for light and temperature.\n</think>\n\nThe student correctly controlled three variables: the genetic makeup of the tomato seedlings, the treatment administered (plant food vs. water), and the time of measurement (4 weeks). However, she should also control for environmental factors such as light and temperature to ensure these variables do not influence the results. \n\nBy controlling for light and temperature, the experiment's outcomes can be more accurately attributed to the plant food treatment alone.\n\nDONE."

End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: A high school student wants to determine if a certain plant food affects the growth rate of tomato plants. She has 10 identical tomato seedlings of the same variety. She designs an experiment where she gives 5 seedlings the plant food mixed with water, while the other 5 seedlings receive only water. After 4 weeks, she measures the height of all plants. The plants receiving the plant food grew an average of 12 cm, while those receiving only water grew an average of 8 cm. \n\nIdentify at least three variables that the student correctly controlled in this experiment, and explain one additional variable she should control to make her experiment more scientifically valid. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out what variables the student controlled correctly in her experiment and also suggest an additional one she should consider. Let me start by recalling what variables are in an experiment. Variables are the factors being studied and those that are held constant to avoid influencing the results.\n\nIn this case, the main treatment is the plant food versus water. The student has 10 seedlings, 5 in each group. So, the independent variable here is whether the plant food is applied or not. She measured the height after 4 weeks, so the dependent variable is the growth in height.\n\nNow, for the controlled variables. First, the number of plants in each group is the same\u20145 each. This is important because having equal numbers helps ensure that other factors, like sunlight or access to nutrients, are distributed similarly between the groups. If she had more in one group, it might not be a fair comparison.\n\nSecond, all seedlings are of the same variety. This means they're genetically identical, so differences in growth shouldn't be due to different genetic makeup. If they were different varieties, it could introduce another variable affecting the results.\n\nThird, the environmental factors like sunlight, water availability, and temperature should be controlled. She probably kept all plants in the same environment to prevent factors other than the treatment from affecting growth. If one group had more sunlight or better drainage, that would skew the results.\n\nNow, for the additional variable she should control. One thing that comes to mind is the initial height of the seedlings before the experiment started. If the initial heights were different, even slightly, that could influence the final growth. For example, if one group started a bit taller, and they both grew the same amount, the final height would still be taller. To ensure that the growth is solely due to the treatment, she should measure and randomize the initial heights.\n\nSo, in summary, she controlled the number of plants, their genetic makeup, and the environment. She should also control the initial height by randomizing or measuring it before the experiment.\n</think>\n\nIn this experiment, the student effectively controlled several variables to ensure a valid comparison between the treatment groups. Here's a breakdown of the controlled variables and the additional one she should consider:\n\n1. **Number of Plants**: She used an equal number of seedlings (5) in each group, which helps in controlling for variables like sunlight and nutrients distribution.\n\n2. **Genetic Makeup**: All seedlings were of the same variety, ensuring that genetic differences don't influence the results.\n\n3. **Environmental Factors**: By keeping all plants in the same environment, she controlled for factors like sunlight, temperature, and water availability.\n\n**Additional Variable to Control:**\n- **Initial Height**: Measuring and randomizing the initial height of the seedlings before the experiment ensures that any differences in growth are due to the treatment, not initial conditions.\n\nBy controlling these variables, her experiment is more scientifically valid and the results more reliable.\n\nDONE."

Let's see, she's testing whether a plant food affects tomato plant growth. She has 10 identical seedlings, which is a good start because that reduces variability between the plants.\n\nFirst, she splits them into two groups: 5 get the plant food mixed with water, and 5 get only water. After 4 weeks, she measures their heights. The treatment groups have an average height of 12 cm, and the control group has 8 cm. That's a significant difference, so it seems like the plant food is effective.\n\nBut the question is about controlling variables. Let me think. Variables are things that can affect the outcome, so she needs to make sure she's not missing anything.\n\nShe mentions they're all the same variety, which is a good point because different varieties might grow at different rates. So variety is one variable she controlled.\n\nAnother thing is that the seedlings are identical, so size at the start should be the same. That makes sense because if they were different sizes, the plant food might just be giving a bigger boost to the larger ones.\n\nShe also mentions that the plant food is mixed with water, and the other group gets just water. So the solvent is the same, which is important. If she had used different solvents, that could affect growth.\n\nWait, but what about the amount of plant food? She doesn't say if it's the same concentration or same volume. If she used different amounts, that could skew the results. So she should probably standardize that.\n\nAlso, she measured height after 4 weeks, but maybe she should measure at the same time of day, same lighting, temperature, etc., to make sure those environmental factors aren't affecting the results.\n\nSo, to sum up, she controlled variety, initial size, and the solvent. She should also control the concentration or amount of plant food. And maybe environmental factors like light and temperature.\n\nI think that's three controlled variables, and an additional one she should control to make it more valid.\n</think>\n\nThe student correctly controlled several variables in her experiment:\n\n1. **Variety of Seedlings**: All plants were of the same variety, ensuring uniform growth characteristics.\n\n2. **Initial Size**: The seedlings were identical, reducing variability due to differences in size.\n\n3. **Solvent**: Both groups received the same solvent (water), preventing any effects from differing solvents.\n\n**Additional Variable to Control**: The student should standardize the concentration and amount of plant food used to ensure equal treatment between groups.\n\n**Conclusion**: DONE."
