End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: Let sets A, B, and C be defined as follows:\nA = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\nB = {3, 4, 5, 6, 7}\nC = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}\n\nCompute the elements of the set (A \u2229 B) \u222a (B \u2229 C) and prove that (A \u2229 B) \u222a (B \u2229 C) = B \u2229 (A \u222a C). \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this problem about sets A, B, and C. Let me first write down what each set contains to make sure I have everything clear. \n\nSet A is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. Okay, that's straightforward. Set B is {3, 4, 5, 6, 7}, and set C is {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}. Got it. \n\nThe problem is asking me to compute the elements of the set (A \u2229 B) \u222a (B \u2229 C). Hmm, okay, so that's the union of two intersections. I need to figure out what each part is and then combine them. \n\nFirst, let's break it down. A \u2229 B means all the elements that are in both A and B. So, looking at A and B:\n\nA = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\nB = {3, 4, 5, 6, 7}\n\nThe common elements here are 3, 4, and 5. So, A \u2229 B = {3, 4, 5}. Got that part.\n\nNext, B \u2229 C. That's the intersection of B and C. Let's see:\n\nB = {3, 4, 5, 6, 7}\nC = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}\n\nSo, the common elements between B and C are 3, 5, and 7. Therefore, B \u2229 C = {3, 5, 7}.\n\nNow, I need to take the union of these two sets: {3, 4, 5} \u222a {3, 5, 7}. The union means combining all the elements from both sets, but without duplicates. So, putting them together, we have 3, 4, 5, and 7. So, the union is {3, 4, 5, 7}.\n\nOkay, so that's the first part. Now, the problem also asks me to prove that (A \u2229 B) \u222a (B \u2229 C) is equal to B \u2229 (A \u222a C). Hmm, that looks a bit more complex. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nI remember that in set theory, there are some distributive laws and other properties that might help here. Specifically, the distributive law states that for any sets A, B, and C, the following holds:\n\nA \u2229 (B \u222a C) = (A \u2229 B) \u222a (A \u2229 C)\n\nBut here, I have (A \u2229 B) \u222a (B \u2229 C) on one side, and B \u2229 (A \u222a C) on the other. I need to see if these two expressions are equal.\n\nLet me try to expand both sides using the distributive law or other set identities to see if they simplify to the same thing.\n\nFirst, let's expand B \u2229 (A \u222a C). Using the distributive law, B \u2229 (A \u222a C) can be written as (B \u2229 A) \u222a (B \u2229 C). So that's exactly the same as (A \u2229 B) \u222a (B \u2229 C). \n\nWait, so that means (A \u2229 B) \u222a (B \u2229 C) is equal to B \u2229 (A \u222a C). So, is that all? Did I just figure it out that quickly?\n\nLet me double-check. If I take B \u2229 (A \u222a C), by distributive law, it's (B \u2229 A) \u222a (B \u2229 C), which is the same as (A \u2229 B) \u222a (B \u2229 C). So yes, that seems correct.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me also compute both sides using the original sets to see if they are indeed equal.\n\nWe already have (A \u2229 B) \u222a (B \u2229 C) as {3, 4, 5, 7}.\n\nNow, let's compute B \u2229 (A \u222a C). First, find A \u222a C. \n\nA = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\nC = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}\n\nA \u222a C combines all elements from A and C, so that's {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}.\n\nNow, B \u2229 (A \u222a C) is the intersection of B and this union. So, B is {3, 4, 5, 6, 7}, and A \u222a C is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}.\n\nThe common elements are 3, 4, 5, 7. So, B \u2229 (A \u222a C) is {3, 4, 5, 7}, which is the same as (A \u2229 B) \u222a (B \u2229 C). \n\nTherefore, both sides are equal, which proves the statement.\n\nI think that covers it. I used the distributive law to show the equality and double-checked by computing both sides with the given sets. Everything seems consistent.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we first compute the elements of the set \\((A \u2229 B) \u222a (B \u2229 C)\\).\n\n1. Compute \\(A \u2229 B\\):\n   - \\(A = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}\\)\n   - \\(B = \\{3, 4, 5, 6, 7\\}\\)\n   - \\(A \u2229 B = \\{3, 4, 5\\}\\)\n\n2. Compute \\(B \u2229 C\\):\n   - \\(B = \\{3, 4, 5, 6, 7\\}\\)\n   - \\(C = \\{1, 3, 5, 7, 9\\}\\)\n   - \\(B \u2229 C = \\{3, 5, 7\\}\\)\n\n3. Compute \\((A \u2229 B) \u222a (B \u2229 C)\\):\n   - \\(\\{3, 4, 5\\} \u222a \\{3, 5, 7\\} = \\{3, 4, 5, 7\\}\\)\n\nNext, we prove that \\((A \u2229 B) \u222a (B \u2229 C) = B \u2229 (A \u222a C)\\).\n\nUsing the distributive law:\n- \\(B \u2229 (A \u222a C) = (B \u2229 A) \u222a (B \u2229 C) = (A \u2229 B) \u222a (B \u2229 C)\\)\n\nThus, both sets are equal.\n\n**Answer:** \\((A \u2229 B) \u222a (B \u2229 C) = \\{3, 4, 5, 7\\}\\) and it is equal to \\(B \u2229 (A \u222a C)\\).

Let me try to wrap my head around it step by step. First, let me write down what each set contains to make sure I have them clear.\n\nSet A is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. Okay, that's straightforward. Set B is {3, 4, 5, 6, 7}, and Set C is {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}. Got it.\n\nThe problem is asking me to compute the elements of the set (A \u2229 B) \u222a (B \u2229 C) and then prove that this set is equal to B \u2229 (A \u222a C). Hmm, okay, so I need to find two things: first, the elements of (A \u2229 B) \u222a (B \u2229 C), and second, show that this union is equal to B \u2229 (A \u222a C).\n\nLet me start by understanding what each of these operations means. The intersection of two sets, denoted by \u2229, consists of all elements that are common to both sets. The union, denoted by \u222a, includes all elements that are in either of the sets. So, for (A \u2229 B), I'm looking for elements that are in both A and B. Similarly, (B \u2229 C) will be elements common to B and C. Then, I take the union of those two results, meaning any element that is in either (A \u2229 B) or (B \u2229 C).\n\nFirst, let's compute A \u2229 B. That would be the elements that are in both A and B. Looking at A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} and B = {3, 4, 5, 6, 7}, the common elements are 3, 4, 5. So, A \u2229 B = {3, 4, 5}.\n\nNext, let's compute B \u2229 C. Set B is {3, 4, 5, 6, 7} and Set C is {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}. The common elements here are 3, 5, 7. So, B \u2229 C = {3, 5, 7}.\n\nNow, the union of these two sets, (A \u2229 B) \u222a (B \u2229 C), would be all elements that are in either {3, 4, 5} or {3, 5, 7}. Let's list them out: 3, 4, 5, 7. So, the union is {3, 4, 5, 7}.\n\nAlright, that's the first part done. Now, I need to prove that this set, {3, 4, 5, 7}, is equal to B \u2229 (A \u222a C). Let me tackle that step by step.\n\nFirst, let's compute A \u222a C. Set A is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} and Set C is {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}. The union of these would include all elements from both sets, so A \u222a C = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}.\n\nNow, B \u2229 (A \u222a C) would be the elements that are in Set B and also in (A \u222a C). Set B is {3, 4, 5, 6, 7}, and (A \u222a C) is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}. The intersection of these two sets is the elements that are in both, so looking at both sets, the common elements are 3, 4, 5, 7. That's the same as the previous result we had for (A \u2229 B) \u222a (B \u2229 C).\n\nTherefore, (A \u2229 B) \u222a (B \u2229 C) equals B \u2229 (A \u222a C). That makes sense because both operations are essentially capturing the elements that are in B and also in either A or C. Whether you do it by first intersecting each pair and then taking the union or by first taking the union of A and C and then intersecting with B, you end up with the same result.\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything. For (A \u2229 B) \u222a (B \u2229 C), we have {3,4,5} \u222a {3,5,7} = {3,4,5,7}. For B \u2229 (A \u222a C), we have {3,4,5,6,7} \u2229 {1,2,3,4,5,7,9} = {3,4,5,7}. Yep, they match. So the proof holds.\n\nI think that covers everything the problem is asking for. I've computed the set and proven the equality as required.\n</think>\n\nAlright, let's break this down step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Compute A \u2229 B**\n- Set A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n- Set B = {3, 4, 5, 6, 7}\n- A \u2229 B = {3, 4, 5}\n\n**Step 2: Compute B \u2229 C**\n- Set B = {3, 4, 5, 6, 7}\n- Set C = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}\n- B \u2229 C = {3, 5, 7}\n\n**Step 3: Compute (A \u2229 B) \u222a (B \u2229 C)**\n- {3, 4, 5} \u222a {3, 5, 7} = {3, 4, 5, 7}\n\n**Step 4: Compute A \u222a C**\n- Set A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n- Set C = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}\n- A \u222a C = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}\n\n**Step 5: Compute B \u2229 (A \u222a C)**\n- Set B = {3, 4, 5, 6, 7}\n- {3, 4, 5, 6, 7} \u2229 {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9} = {3, 4, 5, 7}\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- (A \u2229 B) \u222a (B \u2229 C) = {3, 4, 5, 7}\n- B \u2229 (A \u222a C) = {3, 4, 5, 7}\n- Therefore, (A \u2229 B) \u222a (B \u2229 C) = B \u2229 (A \u222a C)\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe elements of the set (A \u2229 B) \u222a (B \u2229 C) are {3, 4, 5, 7}, and it is proven that this set equals B \u2229 (A \u222a C).\n\nDONE."

Let me write them down first to get a clear picture.\n\nSet A is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. Okay, that's straightforward. Set B is {3, 4, 5, 6, 7}. And set C is {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}. Cool, now I have all three sets in front of me.\n\nThe question is asking me to compute the elements of the set (A \u2229 B) \u222a (B \u2229 C). Then, I need to prove that this set is equal to B \u2229 (A \u222a C). Hmm, okay. So, two parts: first, compute the set, then prove the equality.\n\nLet me start by recalling some set theory basics. The intersection of two sets, A \u2229 B, consists of all elements that are in both A and B. The union of two sets, A \u222a B, consists of all elements that are in either A or B or both. The operation I'm dealing with here is a combination of intersections and unions, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's compute A \u2229 B. That would be the elements common to both A and B. Looking at A: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. And B: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. So, the common elements are 3, 4, 5. Therefore, A \u2229 B = {3, 4, 5}.\n\nNext, I need to compute B \u2229 C. So, elements common to both B and C. B is {3, 4, 5, 6, 7}, and C is {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}. The common elements here are 3, 5, 7.

The union operation combines all elements from both sets, without duplication. So, combining them, we have 3, 4, 5, 7. Therefore, (A \u2229 B) \u222a (B \u2229 C) = {3, 4, 5, 7}.\n\nAlright, that's the first part done. Now, I need to prove that this set is equal to B \u2229 (A \u222a C). Let me recall that set operations can sometimes be tricky, but there are some distributive laws that might help here. Specifically, the distributive law states that for any sets X, Y, Z, the following holds: X \u2229 (Y \u222a Z) = (X \u2229 Y) \u222a (X \u2229 Z). Maybe I can apply that here.\n\nLet me write out B \u2229 (A \u222a C). First, compute A \u222a C. A is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, and C is {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}. So, A \u222a C would include all elements from both sets, which are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9. So, A \u222a C = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}.\n\nNow, I need to compute B \u2229 (A \u222a C). That is, the intersection of B with this union. B is {3, 4, 5, 6, 7}. So, let's see which elements of B are in A \u222a C.\n\nLooking at B's elements: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. A \u222a C has 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9. So, the intersection will be the elements that are in both B and A \u222a C. Checking each element:\n\n- 3: Yes, in both.\n- 4: Yes, in both.\n- 5: Yes, in both.\n- 6: Not in A \u222a C.\n- 7: Yes, in both.\n\nSo, the intersection B \u2229 (A \u222a C) is {3, 4, 5, 7}, which is the same as what I got earlier for (A \u2229 B) \u222a (B \u2229 C). Therefore, the two sets are equal.\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything. For (A \u2229 B) \u222a (B \u2229 C), I had {3, 4, 5} \u222a {3, 5, 7} which is {3, 4, 5, 7}. And for B \u2229 (A \u222a C), I got {3, 4, 5, 7}. So yes, they are the same.\n\nI think that covers both parts of the problem. I computed the set, and then showed through set operations that both expressions result in the same set. I used the distributive law to help with the proof, which made it clearer. I should probably write this out in a more formal way to present the proof step by step.\n\nJust to recap:\n\n1. Compute A \u2229 B: {3, 4, 5}\n2. Compute B \u2229 C: {3, 5, 7}\n3. Union these two: {3, 4, 5, 7}\n4. Compute A \u222a C: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}\n5. Compute B \u2229 (A \u222a C): {3, 4, 5, 7}\n6. Therefore, both expressions equal {3, 4, 5, 7}\n\nI think that's thorough. I don't see any mistakes here, but let me verify one more time.\n\nLooking at (A \u2229 B) \u222a (B \u2229 C):\n\n- A \u2229 B is elements in both A and B: 3, 4, 5\n- B \u2229 C is elements in both B and C: 3, 5, 7\n- Union of these gives 3, 4, 5, 7\n\nAnd B \u2229 (A \u222a C):\n\n- A \u222a C is all elements in A or C: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9\n- B is {3, 4, 5, 6, 7}\n- Intersection with B gives elements in both: 3, 4, 5, 7\n\nYes, both results are the same. So, the equality holds. I think that's solid.\n\nOne thing I might consider is whether there's a more general principle or theorem that justifies this equality, beyond just computing the sets. I think it's related to distributive laws in lattice theory or something like that. Specifically, the distributive law says that intersection distributes over union. So, in this case, since we have a union of two intersections, it can be rewritten as the intersection of the union with one set. So, (A \u2229 B) \u222a (B \u2229 C) = B \u2229 (A \u222a C). That aligns with what I did here.\n\nAlternatively, I could think in terms of elements. For an element x to be in (A \u2229 B) \u222a (B \u2229 C), it must be in either A \u2229 B or B \u2229 C. That means x is in both A and B, or x is in both B and C. Either way, x must be in B. So, the entire set is a subset of B. On the flip side, for an element to be in B \u2229 (A \u222a C), it must be in B and in either A or C. So, x is in B and (A or C). But since x is already in B, if it's in A or C, it's in the union. Wait, but in our case, it's the intersection, so it's in B and (A or C). But since (A \u222a C) includes all elements from A and C, including those in B, so it's the same as the union.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about it another way. Let me represent the Venn diagram in my mind. A, B, C are overlapping sets. A \u2229 B is the overlapping part of A and B. B \u2229 C is the overlapping part of B and C. Their union would include all elements that are in either of these overlaps. On the other hand, B \u2229 (A \u222a C) would include all elements in B that are also in A or C, which would cover the same area as the union of the two overlaps. So, yes, it makes sense visually as well.\n\nI think I've covered all bases here. I computed both sides, double-checked the operations, thought about the underlying principles, and even visualized it with a Venn diagram. I feel confident that the equality holds.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we first compute the individual set operations and then prove the equality.\n\n1. **Compute (A \u2229 B) \u222a (B \u2229 C):**\n   - A \u2229 B = {3, 4, 5}\n   - B \u2229 C = {3, 5, 7}\n   - (A \u2229 B) \u222a (B \u2229 C) = {3, 4, 5} \u222a {3, 5, 7} = {3, 4, 5, 7}\n\n2. **Compute B \u2229 (A \u222a C):**\n   - A \u222a C = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}\n   - B \u2229 (A \u222a C) = {3, 4, 5, 7} (since these are the elements common to B and the union of A and C)\n\n3. **Proof of Equality:**\n   - (A \u2229 B) \u222a (B \u2229 C) = B \u2229 (A \u222a C)\n   - This follows from the distributive law in set theory: X \u2229 (Y \u222a Z) = (X \u2229 Y) \u222a (X \u2229 Z)\n   - Here, X = B, Y = A \u2229 B, Z = B \u2229 C, so (A \u2229 B) \u222a (B \u2229 C) = B \u2229 (A \u222a C)\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe elements of the set (A \u2229 B) \u222a (B \u2229 C) are {3, 4, 5, 7}, and it is equal to B \u2229 (A \u222a C). \n\nDONE."

I need to find the elements of the set (A \u2229 B) \u222a (B \u2229 C) and then prove that this set is equal to B \u2229 (A \u222a C). Hmm, okay. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall what each of these set operations means. The intersection of two sets, denoted by \u2229, contains all elements that are common to both sets. The union of two sets, denoted by \u222a, contains all elements that are in either of the sets. So, for (A \u2229 B) \u222a (B \u2229 C), I need to find the union of two intersections: one between A and B, and another between B and C.\n\nLet me start by figuring out what A \u2229 B is. Set A is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, and set B is {3, 4, 5, 6, 7}. So, the intersection of A and B would be the elements that are in both A and B. Looking at A, the elements 3, 4, and 5 are also in B. Therefore, A \u2229 B = {3, 4, 5}.\n\nNext, I need to find B \u2229 C. Set B is {3, 4, 5, 6, 7}, and set C is {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}. The common elements here are 3, 5, and 7. So, B \u2229 C = {3, 5, 7}.\n\nNow, I have to take the union of these two sets: {3, 4, 5} \u222a {3, 5, 7}. When I combine these, I get all the elements that are in either set. So, that would be 3, 4, 5, and 7. Therefore, (A \u2229 B) \u222a (B \u2229 C) = {3, 4, 5, 7}.\n\nAlright, that's the first part done. Now, I need to prove that this set is equal to B \u2229 (A \u222a C). Let me think about how to approach this. B \u2229 (A \u222a C) means I first find the union of A and C, which is A \u222a C, and then take the intersection of that result with B.\n\nLet me compute A \u222a C first. A is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, and C is {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}. The union of A and C will include all elements from both sets without duplication. So, A \u222a C = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}.\n\nNow, taking the intersection of this with B, which is {3, 4, 5, 6, 7}. So, B \u2229 (A \u222a C) would be the elements that are in both B and A \u222a C. Let's see, elements in B are 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Comparing these with A \u222a C, which has 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9. The common elements are 3, 4, 5, and 7. So, B \u2229 (A \u222a C) = {3, 4, 5, 7}.\n\nWait a minute, that's the same as what I got earlier for (A \u2229 B) \u222a (B \u2229 C). So, {3, 4, 5, 7} equals {3, 4, 5, 7}, which means the two sets are indeed equal. That proves that (A \u2229 B) \u222a (B \u2229 C) = B \u2229 (A \u222a C).\n\nLet me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with A \u2229 B: 3,4,5. Then B \u2229 C: 3,5,7. Union gives 3,4,5,7. Then for B \u2229 (A \u222a C), A \u222a C is 1,2,3,4,5,7,9. Intersection with B gives 3,4,5,7. Yep, same result. So, I think I did it right.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we first compute the required set operations step by step.\n\n1. **Compute A \u2229 B:**\n   - A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n   - B = {3, 4, 5, 6, 7}\n   - A \u2229 B = {3, 4, 5}\n\n2. **Compute B \u2229 C:**\n   - C = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}\n   - B \u2229 C = {3, 5, 7}\n\n3. **Compute (A \u2229 B) \u222a (B \u2229 C):**\n   - {3, 4, 5} \u222a {3, 5, 7} = {3, 4, 5, 7}\n\n4. **Compute A \u222a C:**\n   - A \u222a C = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}\n\n5. **Compute B \u2229 (A \u222a C):**\n   - B = {3, 4, 5, 6, 7}\n   - B \u2229 (A \u222a C) = {3, 4, 5, 7}\n\nSince both (A \u2229 B) \u222a (B \u2229 C) and B \u2229 (A \u222a C) equal {3, 4, 5, 7}, we have proven that:\n\n(A \u2229 B) \u222a (B \u2229 C) = B \u2229 (A \u222a C)\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe set (A \u2229 B) \u222a (B \u2229 C) is {3, 4, 5, 7}, and it is equal to B \u2229 (A \u222a C).

Wait, that's a bit different.\n\nLet me see if I can apply any distributive properties or other set laws here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using Venn diagrams would help visualize this.\n\nImagine three circles representing sets A, B, and C.\n\n- A has elements 1,2,3,4,5\n- B has 3,4,5,6,7\n- C has 1,3,5,7,9\n\nCompute A \u2229 B: the overlap between A and B is 3,4,5.\n\nCompute B \u2229 C: the overlap between B and C is 3,5,7.\n\nNow, union of these two overlaps: 3,4,5,7.\n\nOn the other side, compute A \u222a C: which is 1,2,3,4,5,7,9.\n\nThen, B \u2229 (A \u222a C): elements that are in B and also in A \u222a C.\n\nLooking at B: 3,4,5,6,7\n\nA \u222a C includes 3,4,5,7,6 is not in A \u222a C, so the intersection is 3,4,5,7.\n\nSo, same as before.\n\nAlternatively, is there a general proof for (A \u2229 B) \u222a (B \u2229 C) = B \u2229 (A \u222a C)?\n\nLet me think about it algebraically.\n\nWe can express both sides and see if they are equal.\n\nLeft side: (A \u2229 B) \u222a (B \u2229 C)\n\nRight side: B \u2229 (A \u222a C)\n\nLet me try to manipulate the left side to see if it can be expressed as the right side.\n\nWe know that (A \u2229 B) \u222a (B \u2229 C) can be rewritten using distributive laws.\n\nWait, perhaps using the distributive law for union over intersection.\n\nAlternatively, let's express the left side as B \u2229 [ (A \u2229 B) \u222a (B \u2229 C) ].\n\nBut that might not help directly.\n\nWait, perhaps using the distributive law in another way.\n\nAlternatively, let's see if we can express (A \u2229 B) \u222a (B \u2229 C) as B \u2229 (A \u222a C).\n\nLet me see.\n\nWe can write (A \u2229 B) \u222a (B \u2229 C) = B \u2229 [ (A \u2229 B) \u222a (B \u2229 C) ]\n\nWait, that's redundant.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can factor out B from both terms.\n\nWait, (A \u2229 B) is a subset of B, and (B \u2229 C) is also a subset of B. So their union is also a subset of B.\n\nTherefore, (A \u2229 B) \u222a (B \u2229 C) is a subset of B.\n\nNow, the right side is B \u2229 (A \u222a C), which is also a subset of B.\n\nSo both sides are subsets of B. Therefore, to prove equality, we can show that each side is a subset of the other.\n\nFirst, show that (A \u2229 B) \u222a (B \u2229 C) is a subset of B \u2229 (A \u222a C).\n\nLet x be an element of (A \u2229 B) \u222a (B \u2229 C). Then x is in A \u2229 B or x is in B \u2229 C.\n\nIf x is in A \u2229 B, then x is in B and x is in A. Since A is part of A \u222a C, x is in A \u222a C. Therefore, x is in B \u2229 (A \u222a C).\n\nSimilarly, if x is in B \u2229 C, then x is in B and x is in C. Since C is part of A \u222a C, x is in A \u222a C. Therefore, x is in B \u2229 (A \u222a C).\n\nThus, every element of (A \u2229 B) \u222a (B \u2229 C) is in B \u2229 (A \u222a C). Therefore, (A \u2229 B) \u222a (B \u2229 C) is a subset of B \u2229 (A \u222a C).\n\nNow, to show the reverse inclusion, that B \u2229 (A \u222a C) is a subset of (A \u2229 B) \u222a (B \u2229 C).\n\nLet x be an element of B \u2229 (A \u222a C). Then x is in B and x is in A \u222a C.\n\nSo, x is in B and (x is in A or x is in C).\n\nCase 1: x is in A and in B. Then x is in A \u2229 B, so x is in (A \u2229 B) \u222a (B \u2229 C).\n\nCase 2: x is in C and in B. Then x is in B \u2229 C, so x is in (A \u2229 B) \u222a (B \u2229 C).\n\nTherefore, in either case, x is in (A \u2229 B) \u222a (B \u2229 C). Hence, B \u2229 (A \u222a C) is a subset of (A \u2229 B) \u222a (B \u2229 C).\n\nSince each side is a subset of the other, they must be equal.\n\nTherefore, (A \u2229 B) \u222a (B \u2229 C) = B \u2229 (A \u222a C).\n\nSo, both in computation and in proof, they are equal.\n</think>\n\nThe elements of the set (A \u2229 B) \u222a (B \u2229 C) are {3, 4, 5, 7}, and it is proven that this set equals B \u2229 (A \u222a C).\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation and Proof:**\n\n1. **Compute A \u2229 B:**\n   - A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n   - B = {3, 4, 5, 6, 7}\n   - Common elements: 3, 4, 5\n   - Therefore, A \u2229 B = {3, 4, 5}\n\n2. **Compute B \u2229 C:**\n   - B = {3, 4, 5, 6, 7}\n   - C = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}\n   - Common elements: 3, 5, 7\n   - Therefore, B \u2229 C = {3, 5, 7}\n\n3. **Compute (A \u2229 B) \u222a (B \u2229 C):**\n   - {3, 4, 5} \u222a {3, 5, 7} = {3, 4, 5, 7}\n\n4. **Compute A \u222a C:**\n   - A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n   - C = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}\n   - Combined elements: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9\n   - Therefore, A \u222a C = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}\n\n5. **Compute B \u2229 (A \u222a C):**\n   - B = {3, 4, 5, 6, 7}\n   - A \u222a C = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}\n   - Common elements: 3, 4, 5, 7\n   - Therefore, B \u2229 (A \u222a C) = {3, 4, 5, 7}\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Both (A \u2229 B) \u222a (B \u2229 C) and B \u2229 (A \u222a C) result in {3, 4, 5, 7}\n   - Hence, (A \u2229 B) \u222a (B \u2229 C) = B \u2229 (A \u222a C)\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe elements of the set (A \u2229 B) \u222a (B \u2229 C) are {3, 4, 5, 7}, and it is equal to B \u2229 (A \u222a C).

End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: Let sets A, B, and C be defined as follows:\nA = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\nB = {3, 4, 5, 6, 7}\nC = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}\n\nCompute the elements of the set (A \u2229 B) \u222a (B \u2229 C) and prove that (A \u2229 B) \u222a (B \u2229 C) = B \u2229 (A \u222a C). \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this problem here with three sets A, B, and C. Let me write them down first to get a clear picture.\n\nSet A is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. Okay, that's straightforward. Set B is {3, 4, 5, 6, 7}, and set C is {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}. Got it. So I need to compute the elements of the set (A \u2229 B) \u222a (B \u2229 C). Hmm, okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I think I need to find the intersection of A and B, which is A \u2229 B. Intersection means the elements that are common to both sets. So let's see, A has 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and B has 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. The common elements are 3, 4, 5. So A \u2229 B is {3, 4, 5}.\n\nNext, I need to find the intersection of B and C, which is B \u2229 C. Let's see, B is {3, 4, 5, 6, 7} and C is {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}. The common elements here are 3, 5, 7. So B \u2229 C is {3, 5, 7}.\n\nNow, I need to take the union of these two sets: (A \u2229 B) \u222a (B \u2229 C). So that would be {3, 4, 5} \u222a {3, 5, 7}. The union combines all unique elements from both sets. So combining them, we get {3, 4, 5, 7}.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. From A \u2229 B, we have 3,4,5 and from B \u2229 C, we have 3,5,7. When we take the union, we add the elements from both sets, but without duplicates. So 3 and 5 are already in both, so we just need to include 4 and 7 as well. So yes, {3,4,5,7} is correct.\n\nNow, the second part of the problem asks to prove that (A \u2229 B) \u222a (B \u2229 C) equals B \u2229 (A \u222a C). Hmm, that looks like a distributive property or something similar. Let me recall some set theory.\n\nI remember that the distributive law states that for any sets A, B, C, the following holds: A \u2229 (B \u222a C) = (A \u2229 B) \u222a (A \u2229 C). But here, it's a bit different because it's B \u2229 (A \u222a C). Maybe I can use some properties to manipulate both sides and show they are equal.\n\nLet me first compute B \u2229 (A \u222a C). So A \u222a C is the union of sets A and C. Let's find that first. A is {1,2,3,4,5} and C is {1,3,5,7,9}. So A \u222a C would be {1,2,3,4,5,7,9}.\n\nNow, taking the intersection of B with this union. So B is {3,4,5,6,7}. The intersection of B and {1,2,3,4,5,7,9} is just the elements common to both. Let's see: 3,4,5,7 are in both, and 6 is only in B, but not in A \u222a C. So B \u2229 (A \u222a C) is {3,4,5,7}.\n\nWait a minute, that's the same as what I got earlier for (A \u2229 B) \u222a (B \u2229 C). So both sides equal {3,4,5,7}, which means they are equal to each other. Therefore, the equation holds true.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't skip any steps. Let me try to see if I can derive it more formally. Maybe using some properties.\n\nI know that (A \u2229 B) \u222a (B \u2229 C) can be rewritten using the distributive property. Let me think, since both terms involve B, maybe I can factor B out. Wait, actually, let's see:\n\n(A \u2229 B) \u222a (B \u2229 C) = B \u2229 (A \u222a C). Is that a known identity? It seems similar to the distributive law, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to verify it.\n\nTake any element x in (A \u2229 B) \u222a (B \u2229 C). So x is in A \u2229 B or in B \u2229 C. If x is in A \u2229 B, then x is in B and x is in A. If x is in B \u2229 C, then x is in B and x is in C. Therefore, in either case, x is in B and also in either A or C. So x is in B \u2229 (A \u222a C).\n\nConversely, take any element x in B \u2229 (A \u222a C). Then x is in B and x is in A \u222a C. So x is in B and (x is in A or x is in C). If x is in A, then x is in A \u2229 B. If x is in C, then x is in B \u2229 C. Therefore, x is in (A \u2229 B) \u222a (B \u2229 C).\n\nTherefore, both sets are equal. So yes, (A \u2229 B) \u222a (B \u2229 C) equals B \u2229 (A \u222a C).\n\nI think that covers both the computation and the proof. I didn't make any mistakes in my initial computation, and the proof seems solid by showing the equivalence through element-wise analysis.\n</think>\n\nAlright, let's go through the solution step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Compute A \u2229 B**\n\n- **Set A**: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n- **Set B**: {3, 4, 5, 6, 7}\n\nThe intersection of A and B includes elements common to both sets:\n- Common elements: 3, 4, 5\n\nSo, **A \u2229 B = {3, 4, 5}**\n\n**Step 2: Compute B \u2229 C**\n\n- **Set B**: {3, 4, 5, 6, 7}\n- **Set C**: {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}\n\nThe intersection of B and C includes elements common to both sets:\n- Common elements: 3, 5, 7\n\nSo, **B \u2229 C = {3, 5, 7}**\n\n**Step 3: Compute (A \u2229 B) \u222a (B \u2229 C)**\n\n- **A \u2229 B**: {3, 4, 5}\n- **B \u2229 C**: {3, 5, 7}\n\nThe union of these sets includes all unique elements:\n- Elements: 3, 4, 5, 7\n\nSo, **(A \u2229 B) \u222a (B \u2229 C) = {3, 4, 5, 7}**\n\n**Step 4: Compute B \u2229 (A \u222a C)**\n\n- **First, compute A \u222a C:**\n  - **Set A**: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n  - **Set C**: {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}\n  \n  The union of A and C includes all unique elements:\n  - Elements: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9\n  \n  So, **A \u222a C = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}**\n  \n- **Now, compute B \u2229 (A \u222a C):**\n  - **Set B**: {3, 4, 5, 6, 7}\n  - **A \u222a C**: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}\n  \n  The intersection includes elements common to both sets:\n  - Common elements: 3, 4, 5, 7\n  \n  So, **B \u2229 (A \u222a C) = {3, 4, 5, 7}**\n\n**Step 5: Compare the Two Results**\n\n- **(A \u2229 B) \u222a (B \u2229 C) = {3, 4, 5, 7}**\n- **B \u2229 (A \u222a C) = {3, 4, 5, 7}**\n\nSince both sets are equal, we have proven that:\n** (A \u2229 B) \u222a (B \u2229 C) = B \u2229 (A \u222a C) **\n\n**Final Answer:**\nDONE."

Let me list them out:\n\n- 3: Yes, it's in both A and B.\n- 4: Yes, in both.\n- 5: Yes, in both.\n- 1: Only in A.\n- 2: Only in A.\n- 6: Only in B.\n- 7: Only in B.\n- 9: Not in A or B.\n\nSo, A \u2229 B = {3, 4, 5}.\n\nNext, B \u2229 C. Set B is {3, 4, 5, 6, 7}, and set C is {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}. Let me find the common elements:\n\n- 3: Yes, in both B and C.\n- 4: Only in B.\n- 5: Yes, in both.\n- 6: Only in B.\n- 7: Yes, in both.\n- 1: Only in C.\n- 9: Only in C.\n\nSo, B \u2229 C = {3, 5, 7}.\n\nNow, I need to take the union of these two results: {3, 4, 5} \u222a {3, 5, 7}. The union combines all elements from both sets, without duplicates. So, listing them out:\n\n- 3: From both sets.\n- 4: Only from A \u2229 B.\n- 5: From both sets.\n- 7: From B \u2229 C.\n\nSo, (A \u2229 B) \u222a (B \u2229 C) = {3, 4, 5, 7}.\n\nNow, I need to prove that this set is equal to B \u2229 (A \u222a C). Let me first compute A \u222a C. \n\nA \u222a C is the union of sets A and C. Set A is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, and set C is {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}. The union includes all elements from both sets:\n\n- 1: From both A and C.\n- 2: Only in A.\n- 3: From both.\n- 4: Only in A.\n- 5: From both.\n- 7: Only in C.\n- 9: Only in C.\n\nSo, A \u222a C = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}.\n\nNow, B \u2229 (A \u222a C). Set B is {3, 4, 5, 6, 7}, and A \u222a C is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}. The intersection will be the elements common to both sets:\n\n- 3: Yes, in both.\n- 4: Yes, in both.\n- 5: Yes, in both.\n- 7: Yes, in both.\n- 1, 2, 6, 9: Only in A \u222a C but not in B.\n\nSo, B \u2229 (A \u222a C) = {3, 4, 5, 7}.\n\nComparing this with the earlier result of (A \u2229 B) \u222a (B \u2229 C) = {3, 4, 5, 7}, they are equal. Therefore, the equality holds.\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything. \n\nLooking back at (A \u2229 B) \u222a (B \u2229 C): {3,4,5} \u222a {3,5,7} = {3,4,5,7}.\n\nAnd B \u2229 (A \u222a C): B is {3,4,5,6,7}, A \u222a C is {1,2,3,4,5,7,9}, so the intersection is {3,4,5,7}.\n\nYes, both sets are the same. So the proof is correct.\n</think>\n\nAlright, let's break this down step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Compute A \u2229 B**\n\nSet A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\nSet B = {3, 4, 5, 6, 7}\n\nThe intersection of A and B includes elements common to both sets.\n- Common elements: 3, 4, 5\n\nSo, A \u2229 B = {3, 4, 5}\n\n**Step 2: Compute B \u2229 C**\n\nSet B = {3, 4, 5, 6, 7}\nSet C = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}\n\nThe intersection of B and C includes elements common to both sets.\n- Common elements: 3, 5, 7\n\nSo, B \u2229 C = {3, 5, 7}\n\n**Step 3: Compute (A \u2229 B) \u222a (B \u2229 C)**\n\nWe have:\n- A \u2229 B = {3, 4, 5}\n- B \u2229 C = {3, 5, 7}\n\nTaking the union of these sets:\n- {3, 4, 5} \u222a {3, 5, 7} = {3, 4, 5, 7}\n\nSo, (A \u2229 B) \u222a (B \u2229 C) = {3, 4, 5, 7}\n\n**Step 4: Compute A \u222a C**\n\nSet A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\nSet C = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}\n\nThe union of A and C includes all elements from both sets.\n- All elements: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9\n\nSo, A \u222a C = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}\n\n**Step 5: Compute B \u2229 (A \u222a C)**\n\nSet B = {3, 4, 5, 6, 7}\nSet A \u222a C = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}\n\nThe intersection of B and A \u222a C includes elements common to both sets.\n- Common elements: 3, 4, 5, 7\n\nSo, B \u2229 (A \u222a C) = {3, 4, 5, 7}\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBoth (A \u2229 B) \u222a (B \u2229 C) and B \u2229 (A \u222a C) equal {3, 4, 5, 7}. Therefore,\n\n(A \u2229 B) \u222a (B \u2229 C) = B \u2229 (A \u222a C)\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe elements of the set (A \u2229 B) \u222a (B \u2229 C) are {3, 4, 5, 7}, and the equality holds as shown.\n\nDONE."
