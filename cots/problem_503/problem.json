  "question": "A weather forecasting system classifies each day as either 'Sunny', 'Cloudy', or 'Rainy'. Based on historical data, if today is Sunny, tomorrow has a 70% chance of being Sunny, a 20% chance of being Cloudy, and a 10% chance of being Rainy. If today is Cloudy, tomorrow has a 30% chance of being Sunny, a 50% chance of being Cloudy, and a 20% chance of being Rainy. If today is Rainy, tomorrow has a 20% chance of being Sunny, a 30% chance of being Cloudy, and a 50% chance of being Rainy. If today (Monday) is Sunny, what is the probability that Wednesday will also be Sunny?",
  "answer": "This problem describes a Markov chain with three states: Sunny, Cloudy, and Rainy. The state transitions are governed by the given probabilities.\n\nTo find the probability that Wednesday is Sunny given that Monday is Sunny, we need to calculate the probability of being in state Sunny after two transitions, starting from state Sunny.\n\nWe can organize the transition probabilities into a matrix P:\n\nP = [\n  [0.7, 0.2, 0.1],  // Probabilities of transitions from Sunny\n  [0.3, 0.5, 0.2],  // Probabilities of transitions from Cloudy\n  [0.2, 0.3, 0.5]   // Probabilities of transitions from Rainy\n]\n\nTo find the probability of being in a certain state after two steps, we need to calculate P\u00b2, which is P multiplied by itself.\n\nCalculating P\u00b2 by matrix multiplication:\n\nP\u00b2 = [\n  [0.7\u00d70.7 + 0.2\u00d70.3 + 0.1\u00d70.2, 0.7\u00d70.2 + 0.2\u00d70.5 + 0.1\u00d70.3, 0.7\u00d70.1 + 0.2\u00d70.2 + 0.1\u00d70.5],\n  [0.3\u00d70.7 + 0.5\u00d70.3 + 0.2\u00d70.2, 0.3\u00d70.2 + 0.5\u00d70.5 + 0.2\u00d70.3, 0.3\u00d70.1 + 0.5\u00d70.2 + 0.2\u00d70.5],\n  [0.2\u00d70.7 + 0.3\u00d70.3 + 0.5\u00d70.2, 0.2\u00d70.2 + 0.3\u00d70.5 + 0.5\u00d70.3, 0.2\u00d70.1 + 0.3\u00d70.2 + 0.5\u00d70.5]\n]\n\nFocusing on the entry (0,0) of P\u00b2, which represents the probability of going from Sunny to Sunny in two steps:\n\nP\u00b2(0,0) = 0.7\u00d70.7 + 0.2\u00d70.3 + 0.1\u00d70.2\nP\u00b2(0,0) = 0.49 + 0.06 + 0.02\nP\u00b2(0,0) = 0.57\n\nTherefore, if Monday is Sunny, the probability that Wednesday will also be Sunny is 0.57 or 57%."
