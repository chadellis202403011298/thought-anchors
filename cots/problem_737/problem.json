  "question": "Three colleagues, Alex, Blake, and Casey, each make one statement about who brought cookies to the office:\n\nAlex: 'I did not bring the cookies.'\nBlake: 'Casey brought the cookies.'\nCasey: 'Blake is lying.'\n\nIf exactly one of these three statements is true, who brought the cookies?",
  "answer": "Let's use propositional variables to represent the statements:\n- Let A = 'Alex brought the cookies'\n- Let B = 'Blake brought the cookies'\n- Let C = 'Casey brought the cookies'\n\nWe know that exactly one person brought the cookies, so we have the constraint: (A \u2227 \u00acB \u2227 \u00acC) \u2228 (\u00acA \u2227 B \u2227 \u00acC) \u2228 (\u00acA \u2227 \u00acB \u2227 C)\n\nThe three statements made are:\n1. Alex says: \u00acA\n2. Blake says: C\n3. Casey says: Blake is lying, which means \u00acC (negation of Blake's statement)\n\nSince exactly one of these statements is true, we'll check each possibility:\n\nCase 1: If Alex's statement is true, then \u00acA is true, meaning A is false. If the other statements are false, then C is false (Blake's statement is false) and \u00acC is false (Casey's statement is false), which means C is true. This is a contradiction (C cannot be both true and false).\n\nCase 2: If Blake's statement is true, then C is true. If the other statements are false, then \u00acA is false, meaning A is true, and \u00acC is false, meaning C is true. This scenario gives us A=true, B=false, C=true, which violates our constraint that exactly one person brought cookies.\n\nCase 3: If Casey's statement is true, then \u00acC is true, meaning C is false. If the other statements are false, then \u00acA is false, meaning A is true, and C is false (Blake's statement is false). This scenario gives us A=true, B=false, C=false, which satisfies our constraint that exactly one person brought cookies.\n\nTherefore, Alex brought the cookies."
