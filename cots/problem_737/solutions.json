End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: Three colleagues, Alex, Blake, and Casey, each make one statement about who brought cookies to the office:\n\nAlex: 'I did not bring the cookies.'\nBlake: 'Casey brought the cookies.'\nCasey: 'Blake is lying.'\n\nIf exactly one of these three statements is true, who brought the cookies? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I've got this logic puzzle here about three colleagues: Alex, Blake, and Casey. Each of them makes a statement about who brought the cookies to the office. The problem says that exactly one of these three statements is true, and I need to figure out who actually brought the cookies.\n\nLet me write down the statements first to keep things clear:\n\n1. **Alex**: \"I did not bring the cookies.\"\n2. **Blake**: \"Casey brought the cookies.\"\n3. **Casey**: \"Blake is lying.\"\n\nOkay, so we have three statements, and only one of them is true. My goal is to determine who brought the cookies by analyzing these statements.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. Since only one statement is true, that means the other two must be false. So, I'll need to test each possibility where one statement is true and see if it holds up.\n\nLet's start by considering each person's statement being the true one.\n\n**Case 1: Alex's statement is true.**\n\nIf Alex is telling the truth when he says, \"I did not bring the cookies,\" then that means Alex is innocent. Now, since only one statement is true, both Blake and Casey must be lying.\n\n- If Blake is lying, then his statement \"Casey brought the cookies\" is false. So, Casey didn't bring the cookies.\n- Casey's statement is also a lie, meaning \"Blake is lying\" is false. If Casey is lying about Blake lying, then Blake is actually telling the truth. But wait, that's a contradiction because we already assumed Blake is lying. So this case leads to inconsistency.\n\nTherefore, **Case 1** is impossible because it creates a contradiction.\n\n**Case 2: Blake's statement is true.**\n\nIf Blake is telling the truth when he says, \"Casey brought the cookies,\" then Casey is the one who brought the cookies. Since only one statement is true, both Alex and Casey must be lying.\n\n- If Alex is lying, then his statement \"I did not bring the cookies\" is false. That means Alex actually brought the cookies.\n- But wait, we already assumed that Casey brought the cookies. So now we have both Alex and Casey bringing cookies, which can't be true. This is a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, **Case 2** is also impossible.\n\n**Case 3: Casey's statement is true.**\n\nIf Casey is telling the truth when he says, \"Blake is lying,\" then Blake is indeed lying. Since only one statement is true, both Alex and Blake must be lying.\n\n- If Blake is lying, his statement \"Casey brought the cookies\" is false. So, Casey did not bring the cookies.\n- If Alex is lying, his statement \"I did not bring the cookies\" is false, meaning Alex actually brought the cookies.\n\nSo, in this scenario, Alex brings the cookies, Blake is lying, and Casey is telling the truth. This doesn't lead to any contradictions, so this case is possible.\n\nLet me recap:\n\n- **Casey's statement is true**: So, Casey is truthful.\n- **Blake's statement is false**: So, Casey didn't bring the cookies.\n- **Alex's statement is false**: So, Alex did bring the cookies.\n\nThis seems consistent because only Casey's statement is true, and the others are false.\n\nWait a second, but in this scenario, if Alex brought the cookies, then Blake's statement that \"Casey brought the cookies\" is false, which aligns with Casey's statement that Blake is lying. So everything checks out.\n\nTherefore, the only consistent scenario is where **Alex brought the cookies**.\n\nI should double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\n- If Alex brought them:\n  - Alex's statement: \"I did not bring the cookies.\" \u2192 False.\n  - Blake's statement: \"Casey brought the cookies.\" \u2192 False.\n  - Casey's statement: \"Blake is lying.\" \u2192 True.\n\nYes, exactly one statement is true, which is Casey's. So, this fits the condition.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me consider if there's any other possibility. Suppose two statements are true. But the problem states that exactly one is true, so that's not allowed. Similarly, all three can't be true because the problem specifies only one is true.\n\nTherefore, the only logical conclusion is that Alex brought the cookies.\n</think>\n\nAlex brought the cookies to the office.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the Statements:**\n   - Alex: \"I did not bring the cookies.\"\n   - Blake: \"Casey brought the cookies.\"\n   - Casey: \"Blake is lying.\"\n\n2. **Assume Each Statement is True and Check for Consistency:**\n   - **Case 1: Alex's statement is true.**\n     - Alex \u2192 True: Alex didn't bring cookies.\n     - Blake \u2192 False: Casey didn't bring cookies.\n     - Casey \u2192 False: Blake is not lying (which contradicts Blake's lie).\n     - **Contradiction:** Case 1 is invalid.\n\n   - **Case 2: Blake's statement is true.**\n     - Blake \u2192 True: Casey brought cookies.\n     - Alex \u2192 False: Alex brought cookies.\n     - Casey \u2192 False: Blake is not lying (contradiction).\n     - **Contradiction:** Case 2 is invalid.\n\n   - **Case 3: Casey's statement is true.**\n     - Casey \u2192 True: Blake is lying.\n     - Blake \u2192 False: Casey didn't bring cookies.\n     - Alex \u2192 False: Alex brought cookies.\n     - **Consistent:** Only Casey's statement is true.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - The only valid scenario is when Alex brought the cookies, making Casey's statement the sole true one, and the others false.\n\n**Final Answer:** Alex brought the cookies. DONE."

    "solution": "Solve this problem step by step. End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: Three colleagues, Alex, Blake, and Casey, each make one statement about who brought cookies to the office:\n\nAlex: 'I did not bring the cookies.'\nBlake: 'Casey brought the cookies.'\nCasey: 'Blake is lying.'\n\nIf exactly one of these three statements is true, who brought the cookies? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I've got this problem here about three colleagues\u2014Alex, Blake, and Casey\u2014each making a statement about who brought cookies to the office. The question is, if exactly one of these three statements is true, who actually brought the cookies?\n\nFirst, let me list out what each person said to keep things clear.\n\nAlex says: \"I did not bring the cookies.\"\n\nBlake says: \"Casey brought the cookies.\"\n\nCasey says: \"Blake is lying.\"\n\nOkay, so we have three statements. The tricky part is that exactly one of these is true. That means two of them are lying, and only one is telling the truth. My goal is to figure out who is telling the truth and, consequently, who actually brought the cookies.\n\nLet me start by considering each statement one by one and see how they interact with each other.\n\n**Case 1: Suppose Alex is telling the truth.**\n\nIf Alex is truthful, then his statement \"I did not bring the cookies\" is true. That means Alex didn't bring the cookies. Now, let's look at Blake's statement: \"Casey brought the cookies.\" If Blake is lying, then Casey didn't bring the cookies. But wait, if Alex didn't bring them and Casey didn't bring them, who did? That leaves us with... no one? That doesn't make sense because someone must have brought them. So this leads to a contradiction. Therefore, it's impossible for both Alex and Blake to be telling the truth because that would leave no one as the bringer of cookies. So, if Alex is truthful, Blake must be lying, which leads to a logical inconsistency. Therefore, Alex cannot be the one telling the truth.\n\n**Case 2: Suppose Blake is telling the truth.**\n\nIf Blake is truthful, then his statement \"Casey brought the cookies\" is true. That means Casey did bring the cookies. Now, let's check Casey's statement: \"Blake is lying.\" If Casey is lying, that means Blake is not lying, which aligns with our assumption that Blake is truthful. So, in this scenario, Blake is telling the truth, Casey is lying, and Alex's statement \"I did not bring the cookies\" would also be a lie. Wait, because if Alex is lying, that means Alex did bring the cookies. But hold on, if Casey brought the cookies, then Alex didn't bring them, right? So, if Alex is lying, that would mean Alex did bring the cookies, which contradicts the fact that Casey brought them. So, that's a problem. Therefore, this scenario also leads to a contradiction because Alex's statement being a lie would imply he brought the cookies, but Blake says Casey did, so both can't be true. Thus, Blake can't be the only one telling the truth either.\n\n**Case 3: Suppose Casey is telling the truth.**\n\nNow, let's consider the possibility that Casey is the one telling the truth. Casey says, \"Blake is lying.\" If Casey is truthful, then Blake is indeed lying. So, Blake's statement \"Casey brought the cookies\" is false. That means Casey did not bring the cookies. Now, let's look at Alex's statement: \"I did not bring the cookies.\" If Alex is lying, that means he did bring the cookies. But wait, if Casey didn't bring them and Alex did, that fits. So, in this case:\n\n- Casey is telling the truth (so Blake is lying)\n- Blake is lying (so Casey didn't bring the cookies)\n- Alex is lying (so Alex did bring the cookies)\n\nThis scenario doesn't lead to any contradictions. Only Casey is telling the truth, and the other two are lying. Therefore, this seems to be a valid possibility.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I haven't missed anything. So, if Casey is truthful, Blake is lying, meaning Casey didn't bring the cookies. Then, Alex is lying, meaning Alex did bring them. So, Alex is the one who brought the cookies, and both Blake and Casey are lying. That fits the condition that exactly one statement is true.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. If Alex brought the cookies, then Alex's statement \"I did not bring the cookies\" is a lie, which is consistent. Blake's statement that Casey brought them is a lie, so that's also consistent. Casey's statement that Blake is lying is true, so that's the only true statement. So, this works perfectly.\n\nI think I've covered all the possibilities. Let me just recap:\n\n1. If Alex is truthful, it leads to a contradiction.\n2. If Blake is truthful, it leads to a contradiction.\n3. If Casey is truthful, it doesn't lead to a contradiction and satisfies the condition that only one statement is true.\n\nTherefore, the only possible solution is that Casey is telling the truth, Blake is lying, and Alex is lying. Consequently, Alex brought the cookies.\n\nBut wait, hold on again. If Alex brought the cookies, then Alex is lying when he says he didn't bring them. Blake is lying when he says Casey brought them. Casey is telling the truth when he says Blake is lying. So, yes, that fits: exactly one statement is true (Casey's), and the other two are false (Alex and Blake).\n\nBut wait, in this scenario, it's actually two statements that are false (Alex and Blake), and one that's true (Casey). But the problem says exactly one statement is true, so this still holds because only Casey's is true.\n\nSo, the conclusion is that Alex brought the cookies.\n\nBut wait, hold on one more time. If Alex brought the cookies, then:\n\n- Alex: \"I did not bring the cookies.\" \u2192 Lying \u2192 So, he did bring them.\n- Blake: \"Casey brought the cookies.\" \u2192 Lying \u2192 So, Casey didn't.\n- Casey: \"Blake is lying.\" \u2192 True \u2192 So, Blake is lying.\n\nThus, exactly one statement is true (Casey's), and the other two are false. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is Alex brought the cookies.\n\nWait, but hold on. I thought initially that Casey was the one telling the truth, but that would mean Alex is lying, meaning Alex brought the cookies. So, the person who brought them is Alex.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. So, in this scenario:\n\n- Alex: Liar\n- Blake: Liar\n- Casey: Truth-teller\n\nAnd Alex is the one who brought the cookies.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nI think I've got it now. So, the person who brought the cookies is Alex.\n</think>\n\nThe solution is:\n\nAlex brought the cookies.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Statements:**\n   - Alex: \"I did not bring the cookies.\" (A)\n   - Blake: \"Casey brought the cookies.\" (B)\n   - Casey: \"Blake is lying.\" (C)\n\n2. **Assumption: Exactly one statement is true.**\n\n3. **Case Analysis:**\n   - **Case 1: Alex is truthful (A is true).**\n     - Then, Alex didn't bring cookies.\n     - Blake's statement (B) would be a lie, so Casey didn't bring them.\n     - This leaves no one as the bringer, which is impossible. Thus, Alex cannot be truthful.\n   \n   - **Case 2: Blake is truthful (B is true).**\n     - Then, Casey brought cookies.\n     - Casey's statement (C) would be a lie, meaning Blake is not lying, which contradicts.\n     - Additionally, Alex's statement (A) would be a lie, implying Alex brought cookies, conflicting with Casey. Thus, Blake cannot be truthful.\n   \n   - **Case 3: Casey is truthful (C is true).**\n     - Then, Blake is lying, so Casey didn't bring cookies.\n     - Alex's statement (A) is a lie, meaning Alex did bring cookies.\n     - This scenario is consistent with exactly one true statement (C) and two false statements (A and B).\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Casey's statement is true, indicating Blake is lying.\n   - Alex's statement is false, so Alex brought the cookies.\n\n**Answer:** Alex brought the cookies.\n\nDONE."

Each of them makes a statement about who brought cookies to the office. The problem says that exactly one of these three statements is true, and I need to figure out who actually brought the cookies. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's list out the statements each person made:\n\n1. **Alex:** 'I did not bring the cookies.'\n2. **Blake:** 'Casey brought the cookies.'\n3. **Casey:** 'Blake is lying.'\n\nNow, the key point here is that **exactly one** of these statements is true. That means two of them are false, and only one is true. My goal is to determine who brought the cookies by analyzing these statements.\n\nLet me consider each possibility one by one.\n\n**Case 1:** Suppose Alex's statement is true.\n- If Alex is telling the truth, then he did **not** bring the cookies. So, either Blake or Casey brought them.\n- Blake says that Casey brought the cookies. If Blake is lying (since only one statement is true), then Casey did **not** bring the cookies. That would mean Blake himself brought the cookies.\n- Casey claims that Blake is lying. If Casey's statement is false (since only one statement is true), then Blake is **not** lying. But wait, if Blake is not lying, then Blake's statement that Casey brought the cookies would be true. But that contradicts our initial assumption that only Alex's statement is true. So this leads to a contradiction.\n\n**Case 2:** Suppose Blake's statement is true.\n- If Blake is telling the truth, then Casey brought the cookies.\n- Alex says he didn't bring them, which would be true if Alex didn't bring them. But since only one statement can be true, if Blake's statement is true, then both Alex's and Casey's statements would have to be false.\n- Let's check Casey's statement: Casey says Blake is lying. If Casey is lying, then Blake is not lying, which means Blake's statement is true. That aligns with our assumption that Blake is telling the truth.\n- So in this case, Blake's statement is true, Alex's is false (since Alex didn't bring them, but he said he didn't, which would actually be true if he didn't bring them\u2014but wait, if Blake's statement is true, Casey brought them, so Alex's statement that he didn't bring them is also true. But that can't be because only one statement can be true. So this leads to a contradiction as well.\n\nWait, hold on. If Blake's statement is true, then Casey brought the cookies. Alex's statement that he didn't bring them would also be true because he didn't. But that means both Alex and Blake would be telling the truth, which violates the condition that exactly one statement is true. So this case doesn't work.\n\n**Case 3:** Suppose Casey's statement is true.\n- If Casey is telling the truth, then Blake is lying.\n- Blake says that Casey brought the cookies. If Blake is lying, then Casey did **not** bring them.\n- Alex says he didn't bring the cookies. If Alex's statement is false, then he **did** bring them.\n- So, if Casey is telling the truth, then Blake is lying, which means Casey didn't bring them, and Alex is lying, meaning Alex did bring them.\n- Let's check: Casey's statement is true, so Blake is lying. Blake's statement is false, so Casey didn't bring them. Alex's statement is false, so Alex did bring them. That means Alex is the one who brought the cookies.\n- Now, let's verify: Only Casey's statement is true. Blake's statement is false, and Alex's statement is false. That fits the condition that exactly one statement is true.\n- So this seems consistent.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nIf Alex brought the cookies:\n- Alex says, \"I did not bring the cookies.\" That's a lie, so Alex's statement is false.\n- Blake says, \"Casey brought the cookies.\" That's also a lie because Alex brought them, so Blake is lying.\n- Casey says, \"Blake is lying.\" That's true because Blake is indeed lying.\n- So only Casey's statement is true, which aligns with the condition.\n\nI initially thought there was a contradiction when considering Blake's statement being true, but now that I've re-examined it, it seems that only Casey's statement being true leads to a consistent solution where Alex brought the cookies. So, Alex is the one who brought the cookies.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe person who brought the cookies is \\boxed{Alex}.\n\nDONE.\n</think>\n\nGiven the statements from Alex, Blake, and Casey:\n\n1.

End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: Three colleagues, Alex, Blake, and Casey, each make one statement about who brought cookies to the office:\n\nAlex: 'I did not bring the cookies.'\nBlake: 'Casey brought the cookies.'\nCasey: 'Blake is lying.'\n\nIf exactly one of these three statements is true, who brought the cookies? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I've got this logic puzzle here, and I need to figure out who brought the cookies to the office. There are three people involved: Alex, Blake, and Casey. Each of them makes a statement, and exactly one of these statements is true. My goal is to determine who actually brought the cookies based on their statements.\n\nFirst, let me list out what each person is saying:\n\n- **Alex** says, \"I did not bring the cookies.\"\n- **Blake** says, \"Casey brought the cookies.\"\n- **Casey** says, \"Blake is lying.\"\n\nNow, the tricky part is that exactly one of these three statements is true. That means two of them are false, and only one is true. I need to analyze each possibility carefully to see which scenario fits.\n\nLet me break it down step by step.\n\n**Case 1: Assume Alex's statement is true.**\n\nIf Alex is telling the truth when he says, \"I did not bring the cookies,\" then that means Alex didn't bring them. Now, since only one statement can be true, both Blake's and Casey's statements must be false.\n\n- If Blake's statement \"Casey brought the cookies\" is false, then Casey did not bring the cookies.\n- If Casey's statement \"Blake is lying\" is false, then Blake is not lying. But wait, Blake's statement is \"Casey brought the cookies,\" which we've already determined is false. If Blake is not lying, that contradicts our assumption that Blake's statement is false. This creates a contradiction because we can't have both Blake lying and not lying at the same time.\n\nSo, this scenario doesn't hold. Therefore, Alex's statement cannot be true.\n\n**Case 2: Assume Blake's statement is true.**\n\nIf Blake is telling the truth when he says, \"Casey brought the cookies,\" then Casey did bring them. Now, since only one statement can be true, both Alex's and Casey's statements must be false.\n\n- If Alex's statement \"I did not bring the cookies\" is false, that means Alex did bring the cookies.\n- But wait, we already assumed that Casey brought the cookies. If Alex also brought them, that would mean two people brought the cookies, which isn't possible unless there's a mistake in our assumption.\n\nHold on, this is confusing. If Blake is true, then Casey brought the cookies. That makes Alex's statement false because Alex didn't bring them. But then, what about Casey's statement? Casey says, \"Blake is lying.\" Since Blake is actually telling the truth, Casey's statement is false. So, both Alex's and Casey's statements are false, and Blake's is true. This fits because only one statement is true. So, in this scenario, Blake is telling the truth, and Casey is lying.\n\nBut wait, if Blake is true, Casey brought the cookies. But if Casey brought the cookies, why would Casey lie about Blake? Because Casey says Blake is lying, but Blake is actually truthful. So, Casey is lying, which aligns with our assumption that only one statement is true.\n\nSo, this scenario seems possible. But let's double-check the first case to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n**Case 3: Assume Casey's statement is true.**\n\nIf Casey is telling the truth when he says, \"Blake is lying,\" then Blake is indeed lying. Since only one statement can be true, both Alex's and Blake's statements must be false.\n\n- If Alex's statement \"I did not bring the cookies\" is false, then Alex did bring the cookies.\n- If Blake's statement \"Casey brought the cookies\" is false, then Casey did not bring the cookies.\n\nSo, in this case, Alex brought the cookies, and Casey did not. But we also have Casey's statement being true, which would mean only Casey is telling the truth. This fits because only one statement is true. However, this leads to a contradiction because if Casey brought the cookies, his statement that Blake is lying would be true, but Blake is lying, which contradicts the fact that only Casey is truthful.\n\nWait, no, if Casey's statement is true, then Blake is lying, so Blake's statement that Casey brought the cookies is false. Therefore, Casey didn't bring them. But if Casey didn't bring them, who did? If only one statement is true, and Casey's is true, then Alex's and Blake's must be false. Alex's false means Alex brought them, and Blake's false means Casey didn't. So, Alex brought the cookies, and Casey didn't. But then, Casey's statement is true because Blake is lying. So, this seems consistent.\n\nBut now I'm confused because in Case 2, Blake is true, and in Case 3, Casey is true. But we can't have both, since only one statement can be true.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake in Case 3. Let me re-examine it.\n\nIf Casey is telling the truth, then Blake is lying. Therefore, Blake's statement that Casey brought the cookies is false, meaning Casey didn't bring them. So, if Casey didn't bring them, who did? Since only one statement is true, and Casey's is true, Alex's must be false (so Alex did bring them) and Blake's is also false (so Casey didn't). Therefore, Alex brought them, and Casey didn't. But then, Casey's statement is true because Blake is lying, and Alex's is false, and Blake's is false. So, this is possible.\n\nBut in Case 2, Blake is true, so Casey brought them, and Alex is false, so Alex didn't, and Casey's statement is false because Blake is not lying. Wait, no, if Blake is true, then Casey did bring them, so Casey's statement that Blake is lying would be false because Blake is telling the truth. So, in Case 2, Blake is true, Casey is false, and Alex is false. That works.\n\nBut in Case 3, Casey is true, so Blake is lying, so Blake's statement is false, so Casey didn't bring them. But if Casey didn't bring them, who did? Alex did, because Alex's statement is false. So, Alex brought them, and Casey's statement is true because Blake is lying. That also works.\n\nWait, so both Case 2 and Case 3 seem to fit? But the problem states that exactly one statement is true. So, we need to determine which of these two scenarios is the correct one.\n\nLet me try to clarify.\n\nIn Case 2:\n- Blake's statement is true: Casey brought them.\n- Alex's statement is false: Alex didn't bring them.\n- Casey's statement is false: Blake is not lying.\n\nThis fits because only Blake's statement is true.\n\nIn Case 3:\n- Casey's statement is true: Blake is lying.\n- Alex's statement is false: Alex did bring them.\n- Blake's statement is false: Casey didn't bring them.\n\nThis also fits because only Casey's statement is true.\n\nSo, both scenarios are possible? But that can't be, because the problem should have a unique solution.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in analyzing Case 3. Let me go through it again.\n\nIf Casey's statement is true, then Blake is lying. Therefore, Blake's statement that Casey brought the cookies is false, so Casey didn't bring them. Since only one statement is true, Alex's statement must be false, meaning Alex did bring the cookies. So, in this case, Alex brought them, and Casey didn't. But then, Casey's statement is true because Blake is lying, and Alex's is false, and Blake's is false. So, this scenario is also valid.\n\nBut the problem says exactly one statement is true. So, both Case 2 and Case 3 result in exactly one true statement. Therefore, there are two possible solutions: either Blake brought the cookies, or Alex brought them.\n\nBut that can't be, because the problem should have a unique solution. Maybe I need to re-examine the statements more carefully.\n\nWait, in Case 3, if Casey didn't bring the cookies, and Alex did, then Blake's statement that Casey brought them is false. So, Blake is lying, which aligns with Casey's statement that Blake is lying. So, this is consistent.\n\nIn Case 2, if Casey did bring the cookies, then Blake's statement is true, and Casey's statement that Blake is lying is false because Blake is telling the truth. So, this is also consistent.\n\nSo, both scenarios are possible? But that can't be, because the problem must have a unique answer.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the logic. Let me try a different approach.\n\nLet me consider all possible scenarios where exactly one statement is true.\n\nThere are three statements, so three possibilities for which statement is true.\n\n**Possibility 1: Alex's statement is true.**\n\n- Alex: True (\"I did not bring the cookies.\")\n- Therefore, Alex didn't bring them.\n- Since only one statement is true, both Blake and Casey must be lying.\n- Blake is lying, so Casey did not bring the cookies.\n- Casey is lying, so Blake is not lying.\n\nBut wait, if Blake is not lying, then Blake's statement must be true. But we already assumed that only Alex's statement is true. So, this creates a contradiction because Blake can't both lie and not lie.\n\nTherefore, Possibility 1 is impossible.\n\n**Possibility 2: Blake's statement is true.**\n\n- Blake: True (\"Casey brought the cookies.\")\n- Therefore, Casey brought them.\n- Since only one statement is true, both Alex and Casey must be lying.\n- Alex is lying, so Alex did bring the cookies.\n- Casey is lying, so Blake is not lying.\n\nBut if Blake is not lying, then Blake's statement is true, which is consistent. However, this leads to a contradiction because if Casey brought the cookies, then Alex bringing them would mean two people brought them, which isn't possible unless there's a mistake.\n\nWait, no, if Alex is lying, that means Alex did bring the cookies. So, if both Alex and Casey brought them, that's impossible because only one person can bring the cookies. Therefore, this scenario is impossible because it leads to two people bringing the cookies.\n\nThus, Possibility 2 is invalid.\n\n**Possibility 3: Casey's statement is true.**\n\n- Casey: True (\"Blake is lying.\")\n- Therefore, Blake is lying.\n- Since only one statement is true, both Alex and Blake must be lying.\n- Alex is lying, so Alex did bring the cookies.\n- Blake is lying, so Casey did not bring the cookies.\n\nThis is consistent because:\n- Alex brought the cookies, so Alex's statement is false.\n- Casey didn't bring them, so Blake's statement is false.\n- Casey's statement is true because Blake is lying.\n\nThis scenario doesn't lead to any contradictions. Therefore, Possibility 3 is the valid one.\n\nSo, in this case, Alex brought the cookies.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought Possibility 2 might be possible, but upon closer examination, it leads to a contradiction because it would imply both Alex and Casey brought the cookies, which isn't possible. Therefore, only Possibility 3 is valid, meaning Alex brought the cookies.\n\nBut wait, I'm getting confused again. Let me try to summarize:\n\n- If Alex's statement is true, it leads to a contradiction.\n- If Blake's statement is true, it leads to two people bringing cookies, which isn't possible.\n- Therefore, only Casey's statement can be true, leading to Alex bringing the cookies.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the only consistent scenario is that Casey's statement is true, meaning Blake is lying, so Blake's statement is false, meaning Casey didn't bring the cookies. Therefore, since only one statement is true, Alex must have brought the cookies because his statement is false.\n\nSo, the answer is Alex brought the cookies.\n</think>\n\nThe solution is that Alex brought the cookies to the office.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Assume Alex's statement is true:**\n   - Alex didn't bring cookies.\n   - Blake's statement would be false, meaning Casey didn't bring them.\n   - Casey's statement would be false, meaning Blake isn't lying.\n   - Contradiction because Blake can't both lie and not lie.\n\n2. **Assume Blake's statement is true:**\n   - Casey brought cookies.\n   - Alex's statement is false, meaning Alex brought cookies.\n   - Casey's statement is false, meaning Blake isn't lying.\n   - Contradiction because only one person can bring cookies.\n\n3. **Assume Casey's statement is true:**\n   - Blake is lying.\n   - Blake's statement is false, so Casey didn't bring cookies.\n   - Alex's statement is false, so Alex brought cookies.\n   - Only Casey's statement is true, fitting the condition.\n\n**Conclusion:** Alex brought the cookies.\n\nDONE."

End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: Three colleagues, Alex, Blake, and Casey, each make one statement about who brought cookies to the office:\n\nAlex: 'I did not bring the cookies.'\nBlake: 'Casey brought the cookies.'\nCasey: 'Blake is lying.'\n\nIf exactly one of these three statements is true, who brought the cookies? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I've got this logic puzzle here about three colleagues: Alex, Blake, and Casey. Each of them makes a statement about who brought the cookies to the office. The problem states that exactly one of these three statements is true, and I need to figure out who actually brought the cookies.\n\nFirst, let me list out the statements to keep things clear:\n\n1. **Alex** says: \"I did not bring the cookies.\"\n2. **Blake** says: \"Casey brought the cookies.\"\n3. **Casey** says: \"Blake is lying.\"\n\nNow, the tricky part is that only one of these statements is true. So, my goal is to determine who brought the cookies by assuming each statement as true one at a time and checking for consistency.\n\nLet me start by assuming **Alex's statement is true**. If Alex is telling the truth, then his statement \"I did not bring the cookies\" is true. That means Alex didn't bring the cookies. Now, let's see what this implies for the other statements.\n\nIf Alex didn't bring the cookies, then the cookies were either brought by Blake or Casey. Blake claims that Casey brought them, so if Blake is telling the truth, then Casey did bring the cookies. But wait, Casey says that \"Blake is lying.\" If Casey is telling the truth, that means Blake is indeed lying. But here's the conflict: if Blake is lying, then his statement that \"Casey brought the cookies\" is false. So, if Blake is lying, Casey didn't bring the cookies. But earlier, we assumed that Alex didn't bring them, so if Blake is lying, then neither Blake nor Casey brought them. That leaves no one, which doesn't make sense because someone must have brought the cookies. So, this creates a contradiction. Therefore, our initial assumption that Alex is telling the truth leads to an inconsistency, meaning Alex cannot be telling the truth.\n\nOkay, so Alex's statement is false. That means Alex actually did bring the cookies. Wait, hold on. If Alex's statement is false, then he did bring the cookies. So, Alex is the one who brought them. But let's check what the other statements say.\n\nIf Alex brought the cookies, then Blake's statement \"Casey brought the cookies\" is false. So, Blake is lying. Now, Casey says \"Blake is lying.\" If Casey is telling the truth, then Blake is indeed lying, which aligns with what we just concluded. But the problem states that exactly one statement is true. So far, we've determined that Alex's statement is false, and if Casey's statement is true, then that would make two true statements (Casey and possibly someone else). But we can only have one true statement. Therefore, Casey's statement can't be true because that would make two true statements, which violates the condition.\n\nThis means that if Alex brought the cookies, both Alex and Casey would be making statements, but only one can be true. Since Alex's statement is false, and Casey's statement would be true, that gives us two true statements, which isn't allowed. So, this scenario doesn't work. Therefore, Alex cannot be the one who brought the cookies because it leads to more than one true statement.\n\nAlright, moving on. Let's assume **Blake's statement is true**. If Blake is telling the truth, then Casey brought the cookies. Now, let's see what this implies for the other statements.\n\nIf Casey brought the cookies, then Casey's statement \"Blake is lying\" would be false because Blake is actually telling the truth. So, Casey is lying. Now, Alex says \"I did not bring the cookies.\" If Alex is lying, then Alex did bring the cookies. But wait, we already assumed that Casey brought the cookies. So, if Alex did bring them, that contradicts our assumption that Casey brought them. This is a problem. Therefore, assuming Blake's statement is true leads to a contradiction because it implies both Casey and Alex brought the cookies, which isn't possible.\n\nSo, Blake's statement can't be true either. That leaves us with **Casey's statement being the only true one**. Let's see if that holds up.\n\nIf Casey's statement is true, then Blake is lying. So, Blake's statement \"Casey brought the cookies\" is false. Therefore, Casey did not bring the cookies. Now, Alex says \"I did not bring the cookies.\" If Alex is lying, then Alex did bring the cookies. But wait, we assumed that Casey's statement is true, which means Blake is lying, so Casey didn't bring them. Therefore, if Alex is lying, Alex brought them, which would make Alex the one who brought the cookies.\n\nBut let's double-check this. If Alex brought the cookies, then:\n\n- Alex's statement: \"I did not bring the cookies\" is false. \u2714\ufe0f\n- Blake's statement: \"Casey brought the cookies\" is false. \u2714\ufe0f\n- Casey's statement: \"Blake is lying\" is true. \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo, only Casey's statement is true, which fits the condition perfectly. No contradictions here. Therefore, the only consistent scenario is that Alex brought the cookies, and Casey's statement is the sole true statement.\n\nWait, hold on. Earlier, when I assumed Alex's statement was true, it led to a contradiction, so Alex must be lying, meaning he did bring them. Then, with Alex bringing them, Blake is lying, and Casey is telling the truth, making only Casey's statement true. That works.\n\nBut just to make sure, let's recap:\n\n- If Alex is truthful: Leads to inconsistency (two truths).\n- If Blake is truthful: Leads to inconsistency (two truths).\n- If Casey is truthful: Only Casey is true, and others are false. This works.\n\nTherefore, the only possible scenario is that Alex brought the cookies, and Casey's statement is the sole true one.\n</think>\n\nThe only consistent scenario is that Alex brought the cookies, making Casey's statement the only true one.\n\n**Alex brought the cookies.**\n\nDONE."

Each of them makes a statement about who brought the cookies to the office. The challenge is to figure out who actually brought the cookies, given that exactly one of their statements is true.\n\nLet me start by writing down their statements to keep things clear:\n\n1. **Alex**: \"I did not bring the cookies.\"\n2. **Blake**: \"Casey brought the cookies.\"\n3. **Casey**: \"Blake is lying.\"\n\nNow, the key piece of information is that exactly one of these three statements is true. That means two of them are lying, and only one is telling the truth. My goal is to figure out who brought the cookies by analyzing these statements.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to consider each possibility of who could be telling the truth and see if it leads to a consistent conclusion.\n\n**First Possibility: Alex is telling the truth.**\n\nIf Alex is telling the truth by saying, \"I did not bring the cookies,\" then his statement is true. That would mean Alex is innocent. Now, since only one statement is true, both Blake and Casey must be lying.\n\nLet's check Blake's statement: \"Casey brought the cookies.\" If Blake is lying, then Casey did not bring the cookies. Then, we look at Casey's statement: \"Blake is lying.\" If Casey is lying, then Blake is not lying, which contradicts our assumption that Blake is lying. Hmm, that's a problem. So if Alex is telling the truth, Casey's statement becomes a lie, implying Blake is telling the truth, which can't be because only one statement can be true. So this scenario leads to a contradiction. Therefore, Alex cannot be the one telling the truth.\n\n**Second Possibility: Blake is telling the truth.**\n\nLet's assume Blake's statement is true: \"Casey brought the cookies.\" If that's the case, then Blake is truthful. Since only one statement is true, both Alex and Casey must be lying.\n\nChecking Alex's statement: \"I did not bring the cookies.\" If Alex is lying, then he did bring the cookies. But wait, we just assumed that Casey brought them. So this is a contradiction because both Alex and Casey can't bring the cookies at the same time. Therefore, this scenario doesn't hold either. So Blake cannot be the one telling the truth.\n\n**Third Possibility: Casey is telling the truth.**\n\nNow, let's consider the possibility that Casey is telling the truth: \"Blake is lying.\" If Casey is truthful, then Blake is indeed lying. Since only one statement is true, both Alex and Blake must be lying.\n\nStarting with Alex's statement: \"I did not bring the cookies.\" If Alex is lying, then he did bring the cookies. Now, if Alex brought the cookies, that would mean Casey's statement is true because Blake is lying, and Alex is the one who actually brought them. Let's check if this holds.\n\nSo, Alex is lying, meaning he did bring the cookies. Blake is lying, so Casey did not bring them, which aligns with Alex bringing them. Casey is telling the truth, which means Blake is lying, which is consistent. So in this scenario, only Casey's statement is true, and both Alex and Blake are lying. This fits the condition that exactly one statement is true.\n\nLet me recap:\n\n- **Alex** is lying \u2192 Alex brought the cookies.\n- **Blake** is lying \u2192 Casey did not bring them.\n- **Casey** is truthful \u2192 Blake is lying.\n\nThis all checks out without any contradictions. So the only consistent scenario is that Casey is telling the truth, and therefore, Alex is the one who brought the cookies.\n</think>\n\nAlex brought the cookies to the office.\n\nDONE."

There are three people involved: Alex, Blake, and Casey. Each of them makes a statement about who brought the cookies, and exactly one of these statements is true. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me list out their statements:\n\n- **Alex**: \"I did not bring the cookies.\"\n- **Blake**: \"Casey brought the cookies.\"\n- **Casey**: \"Blake is lying.\"\n\nOkay, so each of them is making a claim, and only one of these three statements is true. My goal is to determine who actually brought the cookies by analyzing these statements.\n\nLet me start by considering each statement one by one and see how they interact.\n\n1. **Assume Alex's statement is true**: If Alex is telling the truth when he says, \"I did not bring the cookies,\" then Alex is not the one who brought them. That means the cookies were either brought by Blake or Casey. Now, since we're assuming only one statement is true, if Alex is telling the truth, then both Blake's and Casey's statements must be false. \n\n   - If Blake's statement is false, then Casey did **not** bring the cookies.\n   - If Casey's statement is false, then Blake is **not** lying. But wait, if Blake is not lying, then Blake's statement must be true. But that contradicts our initial assumption that only one statement is true. So, this leads to a contradiction. Therefore, Alex's statement cannot be true. \n\n   So, Alex must be lying. That means Alex **did** bring the cookies.\n\n2. **But hold on, let's double-check that.** If Alex is lying, then his statement \"I did not bring the cookies\" is false, which means Alex did bring the cookies. Now, if Alex is the one who brought them, then Blake's statement \"Casey brought the cookies\" would be false because Casey didn't bring them. Similarly, Casey's statement \"Blake is lying\" would be true because Blake is indeed lying about Casey bringing the cookies. \n\n   But here's the catch: If we accept that Alex is lying, then both Blake's and Casey's statements are false and true, respectively. That means two statements are true (Alex's lie and Casey's truth), which violates the condition that exactly one statement is true. Therefore, this scenario isn't possible either.\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me try a different approach.\n\n3. **Let's consider if Blake's statement is true.** If Blake is telling the truth by saying \"Casey brought the cookies,\" then Casey must be the one who brought them. Now, if Blake is true, then both Alex's and Casey's statements must be false.\n\n   - If Alex's statement is false, then Alex **did** bring the cookies. But wait, if Casey brought them, then Alex didn't bring them, so this would mean Alex's statement is true, not false. That's a contradiction because we assumed Blake is true, making Alex's statement false, but in reality, Alex's statement would be true. So, this can't be.\n\n   Therefore, Blake's statement can't be true either because it leads to a contradiction.\n\n4. **Alright, so if neither Alex nor Blake can be telling the truth, then the only remaining possibility is that Casey's statement is true.** So, let's assume Casey is telling the truth when he says, \"Blake is lying.\"\n\n   If Casey is truthful, then Blake is indeed lying. Since Blake is lying, his statement \"Casey brought the cookies\" is false. Therefore, Casey did **not** bring the cookies. Now, since only Casey's statement is true, both Alex's and Blake's statements must be false.\n\n   - Alex's statement is \"I did not bring the cookies.\" If this is false, then Alex **did** bring the cookies.\n   - Blake's statement is \"Casey brought the cookies,\" which we've already determined is false because Casey didn't bring them.\n\n   So, under this scenario, Alex is the one who brought the cookies, and both Blake and Casey are lying. This fits the condition that only one statement is true (Casey's), and the rest are false. Therefore, this seems to be the consistent solution.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure there are no other possibilities I might have missed.\n\n5. **Let me summarize the possibilities:**\n\n   - **Case 1**: Alex's statement is true.\n     - Then, Alex didn't bring cookies.\n     - Blake's statement is false, so Casey didn't bring them.\n     - Casey's statement is false, so Blake is not lying, meaning Blake's statement is true.\n     - Contradiction: Both Alex and Blake can't be true.\n   \n   - **Case 2**: Blake's statement is true.\n     - Casey brought the cookies.\n     - Alex's statement is false, so Alex brought the cookies.\n     - Contradiction: Both Casey and Alex can't bring the cookies.\n   \n   - **Case 3**: Casey's statement is true.\n     - Blake is lying.\n     - Blake's statement is false, so Casey didn't bring the cookies.\n     - Alex's statement is false, so Alex brought the cookies.\n     - Only Casey's statement is true, which fits the condition.\n\nSo, only Case 3 works without leading to contradictions. Therefore, Alex must have brought the cookies.\n\n**Final Answer:** Alex brought the cookies.\nDONE.\n```"

So, the cookies must have been brought by either Blake or Casey.\n\nNow, let's look at Blake's statement: \"Casey brought the cookies.\" If Alex is telling the truth, then Blake's statement could be either true or false. But since we're assuming only one statement is true, if Blake's statement is true, then we have two true statements (Alex and Blake), which contradicts the condition that exactly one is true. Therefore, Blake's statement must be false. If Blake is lying, then Casey did not bring the cookies.\n\nNow, Casey says, \"Blake is lying.\" If Casey's statement is true, then Blake is indeed lying, which aligns with our previous conclusion. However, in this scenario, we have two true statements: Alex and Casey. Again, this contradicts the condition that only one statement is true. Therefore, Casey's statement must be false as well. If Casey is lying, then Blake is not lying, meaning Blake's statement is true.\n\nWait a minute, this is getting a bit tangled. Let's recap:\n\n- If Alex is true (Alex didn't bring cookies), then Blake's statement must be false (so Casey didn't bring cookies). If Blake is lying, then Casey's statement must be true (Blake is lying). But that would make both Alex and Casey true, which is two truths\u2014this can't be because only one statement can be true.\n\nTherefore, assuming Alex's statement is true leads to a contradiction because it results in two true statements. So, Alex's statement cannot be the true one.\n\n**Scenario 2: Assume Blake's statement is true.**\n\nIf Blake is telling the truth when he says, \"Casey brought the cookies,\" then Casey did bring the cookies. Let's see what Casey says: \"Blake is lying.\" If Casey brought the cookies, then Casey's statement that Blake is lying would be false because Blake is actually telling the truth. So, if Blake is true, Casey is lying, meaning Casey's statement is false.\n\nNow, what about Alex? Alex says, \"I did not bring the cookies.\" If Casey brought the cookies, then Alex's statement could be either true or false. But we've already assumed that only Blake's statement is true. Therefore, both Alex and Casey must be lying.\n\nIf Alex is lying, then he did bring the cookies. But wait, we just assumed that Casey brought the cookies. This is a contradiction because both Alex and Casey can't have brought the cookies at the same time. So, this scenario doesn't hold either.\n\nTherefore, assuming Blake's statement is true also leads to a contradiction because it would require Alex to be lying, which would mean Alex brought the cookies, conflicting with Casey's supposed action.\n\n**Scenario 3: Assume Casey's statement is true.**\n\nIf Casey is telling the truth when he says, \"Blake is lying,\" then Blake is indeed lying. So, Blake's statement that \"Casey brought the cookies\" is false, meaning Casey did not bring the cookies.\n\nNow, if Casey didn't bring the cookies, and Blake is lying, then the cookies must have been brought by someone else. The only other person is Alex. But Alex says, \"I did not bring the cookies.\" If Alex is telling the truth, then Alex didn't bring the cookies, which would mean no one brought the cookies, which isn't possible because someone must have brought them. Therefore, Alex's statement must be false, meaning Alex did bring the cookies.\n\nWait, so if Alex is lying, then he did bring the cookies. That would mean:\n\n- Alex brought the cookies.\n- Blake is lying, so Casey didn't bring them.\n- Casey is telling the truth, so Blake is lying.\n\nThis scenario only has one true statement: Casey's statement. The others are false, which fits the condition that exactly one statement is true.\n\nSo, in this scenario, Alex is the one who brought the cookies.\n\nLet me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n- **Casey's statement**: \"Blake is lying.\" If this is true, then Blake is lying.\n- **Blake's statement**: \"Casey brought the cookies.\" Since Blake is lying, Casey did not bring the cookies.\n- **Alex's statement**: \"I did not bring the cookies.\" If Alex is lying, then he did bring them.\n\nYes, that checks out.

That means Alex didn't bring the cookies.

So, Casey did not bring the cookies.\n- If Casey is lying, then his statement \"Blake is lying\" is false. So, Blake is not lying, which would mean Blake is telling the truth.

So, this case also leads to a contradiction. Therefore, Blake cannot be the one telling the truth.\n\n**Case 3: Suppose Casey is telling the truth.**\nIf Casey is truthful, then his statement \"Blake is lying\" is true.

But this contradicts our assumption that only Alex is telling the truth.\n- Therefore, this case is impossible because if Alex is true, Casey's statement leads to Blake being true, resulting in two truths, which violates the condition that only one statement is true.\n\nSo, Case 1 doesn't work.\n\n**Case 2: Suppose Blake's statement is true.**\n- Blake: True (\"Casey brought the cookies.\")\n- If Blake is telling the truth, then Casey brought the cookies.\n- Since only one statement is true, both Alex and Casey must be lying.\n- Alex's statement: \"I did not bring the cookies.\" If Alex is lying, then Alex did bring the cookies. But this contradicts Blake's statement that Casey brought them.\n- Wait, hold on. If Blake is true, Casey brought them. But if Alex is lying, Alex brought them. So, both Casey and Alex can't have brought them. That's a problem.\n\nTherefore, this case also leads to a contradiction. So, Case 2 isn't possible either.\n\n**Case 3: Suppose Casey's statement is true.**\n- Casey: True (\"Blake is lying.\")\n- If Casey is telling the truth, then Blake is indeed lying.\n- Since only one statement is true, both Alex and Blake must be lying.\n- Alex's statement: \"I did not bring the cookies.\" If Alex is lying, then Alex brought the cookies.\n- Blake's statement: \"Casey brought the cookies.\" If Blake is lying, then Casey did not bring the cookies.\n- Wait, but Casey's statement is true, meaning Blake is lying. So, Casey didn't bring them, but Alex did. That fits because Alex brought them, and Casey didn't. And Blake is lying about Casey bringing them.\n\nSo, in this scenario, only Casey's statement is true, and the others are false, which satisfies the condition that exactly one statement is true.\n\nLet me double-check to ensure I didn't miss anything.\n\n- Alex says he didn't bring them, but if he's lying, he did bring them. So, Alex = Brought.\n- Blake says Casey brought them, but since he's lying, Casey didn't.\n- Casey says Blake is lying, which is true because Blake is indeed lying.\n\nYes, this works without any contradictions. Only Casey's statement is true.\n\nSo, the conclusion is that Alex brought the cookies.\n</think>\n\nThe solution is that Alex brought the cookies. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Statements:**\n   - Alex: \"I did not bring the cookies.\"\n   - Blake: \"Casey brought the cookies.\"\n   - Casey: \"Blake is lying.\"\n\n2. **Assume Each Statement is True and Check for Contradictions:**\n\n   - **If Alex's statement is true:**\n     - Alex didn't bring cookies.\n     - Both Blake and Casey must be lying.\n     - If Blake is lying, Casey didn't bring cookies.\n     - If Casey is lying, Blake is telling the truth \u2192 Contradiction (two truths).\n     - **Contradiction.** Not possible.\n\n   - **If Blake's statement is true:**\n     - Casey brought cookies.\n     - Both Alex and Casey must be lying.\n     - If Alex is lying, he brought cookies \u2192 Contradiction with Blake's statement.\n     - **Contradiction.** Not possible.\n\n   - **If Casey's statement is true:**\n     - Blake is lying.\n     - Both Alex and Blake must be lying.\n     - If Alex is lying, he brought cookies.\n     - If Blake is lying, Casey didn't bring cookies.\n     - This scenario is consistent with only Casey's statement being true.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - Only Casey's statement is true.\n   - Therefore, Alex brought the cookies.\n\n**Answer:** Alex brought the cookies.\n\nDONE."
