  "question": "A small coastal town has three different supply routes for food and essential goods: a main highway, a secondary road through mountains, and delivery by boat. Historical data shows that during storm season (3 months per year), the probability of each route becoming temporarily unusable is: highway (40%), mountain road (60%), and boat delivery (80%). The town council wants to assess the town's resilience in terms of maintaining at least one viable supply route during storm season. What is the probability that all three supply routes will be simultaneously unusable during a storm, and what does this tell us about the system's resilience?",
  "answer": "To solve this problem, we need to find the probability that all three routes are simultaneously unusable during a storm.\n\nGiven information:\n- Highway: 40% probability of being unusable (0.4)\n- Mountain road: 60% probability of being unusable (0.6)\n- Boat delivery: 80% probability of being unusable (0.8)\n\nAssuming the three routes fail independently of each other, the probability that all three routes are simultaneously unusable is the product of their individual probabilities of failure:\n\nP(all routes unusable) = 0.4 \u00d7 0.6 \u00d7 0.8 = 0.192 = 19.2%\n\nThis means there is a 19.2% chance that the town will have all supply routes cut off during storm season.\n\nConversely, the probability that at least one route remains usable is:\nP(at least one route usable) = 1 - P(all routes unusable) = 1 - 0.192 = 0.808 = 80.8%\n\nFrom a resilience analysis perspective, this tells us that:\n1. The system has redundancy (three different routes)\n2. The system has a relatively high probability (80.8%) of maintaining at least one functional supply line during storms\n3. However, there's still a significant risk (19.2%) of complete isolation\n\nTo improve resilience, the town could consider:\n- Investing in making the highway more storm-resistant (as it has the lowest failure rate)\n- Adding a fourth supply route\n- Increasing local food storage capacity to withstand periods when all routes might be unusable\n\nThis demonstrates a basic resilience analysis by quantifying the likelihood of system failure and identifying potential improvements to reduce vulnerability."
