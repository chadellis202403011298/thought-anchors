End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: A small coastal town has three different supply routes for food and essential goods: a main highway, a secondary road through mountains, and delivery by boat. Historical data shows that during storm season (3 months per year), the probability of each route becoming temporarily unusable is: highway (40%), mountain road (60%), and boat delivery (80%). The town council wants to assess the town's resilience in terms of maintaining at least one viable supply route during storm season. What is the probability that all three supply routes will be simultaneously unusable during a storm, and what does this tell us about the system's resilience? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I've got this probability problem to solve about a coastal town's supply routes during storm season. Let me try to break it down step by step. \n\nFirst, the problem states there are three supply routes: a main highway, a secondary mountain road, and delivery by boat. Each of these has a certain probability of becoming unusable during storm season. Specifically, the highway has a 40% chance, the mountain road has a 60% chance, and the boat delivery has an 80% chance. The town council wants to assess the town's resilience by determining the probability that all three routes are simultaneously unusable. This will help them understand how resilient the system is in maintaining at least one viable route.\n\nOkay, so I need to find the probability that all three routes are unusable at the same time. That means I need to calculate the probability that the highway is unusable, AND the mountain road is unusable, AND the boat delivery is unusable. \n\nI remember that in probability, when we want to find the probability of multiple independent events occurring, we multiply their individual probabilities. But first, I should confirm whether these events are independent. \n\nLet me think: The state of one route being unusable doesn't necessarily affect the state of another route, right? So, the usability of the highway shouldn't influence whether the mountain road is usable or not, and similarly for the boat. So, I think these are independent events. That means I can use the multiplication rule for independent probabilities.\n\nSo, the probability that the highway is unusable is 40%, which is 0.4. The mountain road is unusable with a probability of 60%, or 0.6. The boat delivery is unusable with an 80% chance, which is 0.8. \n\nSince these are independent, I multiply these probabilities together to get the probability that all three are unusable simultaneously. \n\nLet me write that down:\n\nP(all unusable) = P(highway unusable) * P(mountain road unusable) * P(boat unusable)\n= 0.4 * 0.6 * 0.8\n\nNow, let me calculate that:\n\n0.4 * 0.6 = 0.24\n\nThen, 0.24 * 0.8 = 0.192\n\nSo, the probability that all three supply routes are unusable during a storm season is 0.192, which is 19.2%.\n\nHmm, that seems a bit low. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, 40% of the highway being unusable is 0.4, mountain road is 60%, which is 0.6, and boat is 80%, which is 0.8. Multiplying them: 0.4 * 0.6 = 0.24, and 0.24 * 0.8 = 0.192. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo, the probability is indeed 0.192, or 19.2%. \n\nNow, what does this tell us about the system's resilience? Well, the town's resilience is about maintaining at least one viable supply route during storm season. If all three routes are unusable, that's a problem because there would be no way to get supplies in. The probability of this happening is 19.2%, which is quite low, meaning it's not very likely. \n\nThis suggests that the system is relatively resilient because the probability of all routes failing simultaneously is quite small. However, it's important to note that while the probability is low, it's still a concern because even a 20% chance means there's a non-negligible risk. The council might want to consider backup measures or alternative routes to further enhance resilience, just to be safe.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem is asking for the probability that all three are unusable, which is the scenario where there are no viable routes left. So, if this probability is 19.2%, that means there's a 19.2% chance the town would be cut off entirely. \n\nBut in terms of resilience, the council is interested in maintaining at least one route. So, the resilience is about the system's ability to function even when some components fail. The probability that all fail is a measure of how robust the system is. A lower probability of all failing means higher resilience.\n\nBut wait, I think I might have confused something here. Actually, in resilience engineering, we often look at the probability of failure of all components, but in this case, the town council wants to ensure at least one route remains viable. So, perhaps a better measure would be the probability that at least one route is still operational.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes people use the complement of the probability that all routes fail. So, the probability that at least one route is operational is 1 minus the probability that all are unusable. Let me calculate that as well.\n\nP(at least one viable) = 1 - P(all unusable) = 1 - 0.192 = 0.808, or 80.8%.\n\nThat makes sense because if there's an 80.8% chance that at least one route is still working, the system is quite resilient. So, the probability that all routes fail is 19.2%, meaning there's an 80.8% chance of having at least one route open, which is the key for resilience.\n\nTherefore, the town's resilience is quite good because the probability of being cut off is relatively low. However, it's still a significant risk, so the council might want to implement measures to further reduce the chance of all routes failing, perhaps by improving each route's reliability or having redundant systems.\n\nWait, but the problem specifically asks for the probability that all three routes are simultaneously unusable, which is 19.2%. So, that's the answer they're looking for. The fact that this probability is low indicates that the system is resilient because it's unlikely for all routes to fail together. But it's always good to have redundancy, just in case.\n\nSo, to summarize, the probability that all three supply routes are unusable during a storm season is 19.2%, which tells us that the system has a high level of resilience since the simultaneous failure of all routes is relatively unlikely. However, even though the probability is low, it's still a concern, and the town might benefit from additional backup measures to further enhance resilience.\n</think>\n\nThe probability that all three supply routes will be simultaneously unusable during a storm season is 19.2%. This indicates that the town's resilience is high, as the likelihood of all routes failing together is relatively low. \n\n**Answer:** The probability is 19.2%, which means the town is resilient as it is unlikely for all routes to fail simultaneously. \n\nDONE."

Historical data shows that during storm season (3 months per year), the probability of each route becoming temporarily unusable is: highway (40%), mountain road (60%), and boat delivery (80%). The town council wants to assess the town's resilience in terms of maintaining at least one viable supply route during storm season. What is the probability that all three supply routes will be simultaneously unusable during a storm, and what does this tell us about the system's resilience? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I've got this problem about a coastal town with three different supply routes: a main highway, a secondary mountain road, and delivery by boat. The town council wants to assess their resilience during storm season, which lasts for three months a year. The probabilities of each route becoming unusable are given as follows: highway is 40%, mountain road is 60%, and boat delivery is 80%. The question is asking for the probability that all three routes will be simultaneously unusable during a storm, and what this tells us about the system's resilience.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly is being asked. Resilience in this context seems to be about the ability of the town to maintain at least one viable supply route during storm season. So, the council wants to know the chance that all three routes fail at the same time, which would mean the town has no way to get supplies. This probability would give an idea of how likely the town is to face a complete supply failure, which in turn affects its resilience.\n\nOkay, so to find the probability that all three routes are unusable, I think I need to calculate the probability of each route being unusable and then combine them since the events are independent, right? Well, the problem doesn't specify any dependencies between the routes, so I can assume they are independent events. That makes the math easier because I can just multiply the probabilities.\n\nSo, the highway is unusable with a probability of 40%, or 0.4. The mountain road is unusable with 60%, which is 0.6, and the boat delivery is unusable with 80%, so that's 0.8. If I multiply these three probabilities together, I should get the probability that all three are unusable.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nP(all three unusable) = P(highway unusable) * P(mountain road unusable) * P(boat unusable)\n= 0.4 * 0.6 * 0.8\n\nHmm, let me compute that. 0.4 times 0.6 is 0.24, and then 0.24 times 0.8 is 0.192. So, 0.192, which is 19.2%.\n\nWait, that seems low. Is that correct? Let me double-check. 40% of the time the highway is out, 60% the mountain road, and 80% the boat. So, the chance that all three are out at the same time should be the product of their individual probabilities. Yeah, that makes sense because each route's failure is independent.\n\nSo, the probability that all three routes are unusable is 19.2%. That means there's a 19.2% chance the town would have no viable supply routes during a storm. Therefore, the town's resilience is affected by this probability because if all routes fail, the town would face a supply shortage.\n\nBut wait, the council is interested in maintaining at least one viable route. So, the resilience is about the ability to have at least one working route. The probability we just calculated is the chance of complete failure, which is the complement of having at least one route working. So, maybe the resilience is 1 minus that probability?\n\nLet me think. The probability of all three being unusable is 19.2%, so the probability that at least one is usable is 100% - 19.2% = 80.8%. That seems high, but considering each route has a high probability of being usable, it makes sense.\n\nSo, in terms of resilience, the town has an 80.8% chance of maintaining at least one viable route during a storm. That's pretty good, but the 19.2% chance of total failure is still something to be concerned about.\n\nI should also consider if there's any dependency between the routes. The problem doesn't mention any, so I think it's safe to assume they are independent. If they weren't, the calculation would be more complex, maybe involving joint probabilities and covariance, but since there's no information, independence is the way to go.\n\nAnother thing to think about is the meaning of resilience here. It's about how well the system can withstand and recover from disruptions. So, a 19.2% chance of total failure means that in about 1 out of every 5 storm seasons, the town would face a supply crisis. That's a significant risk, so the town might want to look into improving at least one of the routes to reduce this probability.\n\nAlternatively, the town could diversify their supply routes further or invest in making one of the routes more resilient, perhaps by building better infrastructure or adding redundancy. This would help lower the probability of all three routes failing simultaneously.\n\nIn summary, calculating the probability that all three routes are unusable involves multiplying their individual failure probabilities because the events are independent. This gives us a 19.2% chance of total supply failure, which in turn tells us that the town's resilience is relatively strong since there's an 80.8% chance of having at least one viable route each storm season.\n</think>\n\nThe probability that all three supply routes will be simultaneously unusable during a storm is 19.2%. This indicates that there's an 80.8% chance the town will have at least one viable route, highlighting the system's resilience.\n\n**Answer:** The probability that all three routes are unusable is 19.2%, meaning there's an 80.8% chance of maintaining at least one viable route. This demonstrates moderate resilience, as the town is highly likely to have a functioning supply route during storms.\n\nDONE."

It's straightforward multiplication for independent events.\n\nSo, to sum it up, the probability that all three supply routes are simultaneously unusable is 19.2%. This means that there's an 18.8% chance that at least one route remains usable, which suggests the system has moderate resilience since there's a non-negligible chance of having at least one route functioning. However, the 19.2% probability of all routes failing indicates that the town isn't extremely resilient and could face supply issues during storm seasons.\n</think>\n\nThe probability that all three supply routes will be simultaneously unusable during a storm is 19.2%.

The town council wants to assess their resilience during storm season, which lasts for three months a year. The probabilities of each route being unusable during a storm are given as 40% for the highway, 60% for the mountain road, and 80% for the boat delivery. The question is asking for the probability that all three routes will be simultaneously unusable during a storm and what this tells us about the system's resilience.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the problem is asking. They want the probability that all three routes are unusable at the same time. That means I need to calculate the probability that the highway is unusable AND the mountain road is unusable AND the boat delivery is unusable. This sounds like a probability problem that involves multiple independent events.\n\nI recall that in probability, when we have independent events, the probability of all of them happening is the product of their individual probabilities. So, if I can find the probability for each route being unusable, I can multiply them together to get the combined probability.\n\nLet me write down the probabilities:\n\n- Highway unusable: 40% or 0.4\n- Mountain road unusable: 60% or 0.6\n- Boat delivery unusable: 80% or 0.8\n\nNow, since these are independent events, meaning the usability of one doesn't affect the others, I can multiply these probabilities together to find the probability that all three are unusable.\n\nSo, the calculation would be:\n\n0.4 (highway) * 0.6 (mountain road) * 0.8 (boat) = ?\n\nLet me compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, multiply 0.4 and 0.6:\n\n0.4 * 0.6 = 0.24\n\nThen, multiply that result by 0.8:\n\n0.24 * 0.8 = 0.192\n\nSo, 0.192 is the probability that all three routes are unusable simultaneously.\n\nNow, to express this as a percentage, I can multiply 0.192 by 100:\n\n0.192 * 100 = 19.2%\n\nThat means there's a 19.2% chance that all three supply routes will be unusable during a storm.\n\nBut what does this tell us about the system's resilience? Well, resilience is about the ability to withstand and recover from disruptions. In this case, the town wants to maintain at least one viable supply route during a storm. The probability that all routes are unusable is relatively low (19.2%), which suggests that the system has some redundancy. However, since the probability is not extremely low, it indicates that there's a risk, but the system is not extremely vulnerable either.\n\nIt might also be useful to consider the individual probabilities. The boat delivery route is the most likely to be unusable (80%), followed by the mountain road (60%), and the highway is the least likely (40%). This tells us that the town relies heavily on the boat delivery, so improving that route might be a good resilience strategy.\n\nAdditionally, to get a better understanding of the system's resilience, it's also useful to consider the probability that at least one route remains usable. Since the probability that all three are unusable is 19.2%, the probability that at least one is usable would be 1 - 0.192 = 0.808, or 80.8%. That's a high probability, indicating that the town is quite resilient because there's an 80.8% chance that at least one route remains functional during a storm.\n\nSo, in summary, the probability that all three routes are unusable is 19.2%, which is relatively low, suggesting moderate resilience. However, since there's still a significant chance (over 80%) that at least one route remains usable, the town's resilience is quite good.\n</think>\n\nThe probability that all three supply routes will be simultaneously unusable during a storm is 19.2%. This indicates that while the town has some resilience, there is still a moderate risk of all routes being unavailable. The high probability of at least one route remaining usable (80.8%) suggests strong resilience overall.\n\n**Answer:** The probability that all three supply routes will be simultaneously unusable is 19.2%. This shows that the town has moderate resilience, with an 80.8% chance that at least one route remains usable during a storm.\n\nDONE."

During storm season, each route has a certain probability of being unusable. The town council wants to assess the system's resilience, which is defined as the probability that at least one route remains usable. The question specifically asks for the probability that all three routes are simultaneously unusable and what that implies about the system's resilience.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the problem. We have three supply routes:\n\n1. Main highway: 40% chance of being unusable.\n2. Mountain road: 60% chance of being unusable.\n3. Boat delivery: 80% chance of being unusable.\n\nWe need to find the probability that all three are unusable at the same time. Then, we can use that to determine the system's resilience, which is the probability that at least one route is still usable.\n\nI remember that in probability, when dealing with independent events, the probability of all events occurring is the product of their individual probabilities. So, if the unavailability of each route is independent, the probability that all three are unusable is just the product of their individual probabilities.\n\nLet me write down the probabilities:\n\n- P(Highway unusable) = 0.40\n- P(Mountain road unusable) = 0.60\n- P(Boat delivery unusable) = 0.80\n\nAssuming these events are independent, the probability that all three are unusable is:\n\nP(all unusable) = P(Highway unusable) * P(Mountain road unusable) * P(Boat unusable) = 0.40 * 0.60 * 0.80\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n0.40 * 0.60 = 0.24\n\n0.24 * 0.80 = 0.192\n\nSo, the probability that all three routes are unusable is 19.2%.\n\nNow, the system's resilience is the probability that at least one route is usable. To find this, it's easier to calculate the complement: the probability that all routes are unusable, and then subtract that from 1.\n\nResilience = 1 - P(all unusable) = 1 - 0.192 = 0.808\n\nSo, the resilience is 80.8%.\n\nThis tells us that there's an 80.8% chance that at least one supply route remains usable during a storm season. This is a key indicator of the town's ability to withstand and recover from such events. The lower the probability of all routes being unusable, the higher the resilience. In this case, since the probability is quite low (19.2%), the system is relatively resilient.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\n0.40 * 0.60 = 0.24\n\n0.24 * 0.80 = 0.192\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nThen, 1 - 0.192 = 0.808, which is 80.8%.\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nSo, the probability that all three routes are unusable is 19.2%, and the resilience is 80.8%.\n</think>\n\nThe probability that all three supply routes are simultaneously unusable during a storm season is 19.2%. This means there's an 80.8% chance that at least one route remains usable, indicating the town's resilience.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe probability that all three supply routes will be unusable is 19.2%. This implies the system's resilience is 80.8%, meaning there's an 80.8% chance at least one route remains usable, showcasing strong resilience.\n\nDONE."

Since each route is independent of the others, the probability that all three are unusable should be the product of each individual probability.\n\nSo, let me write down the probabilities:\n\n- Highway unusable: 40% or 0.4\n- Mountain road unusable: 60% or 0.6\n- Boat delivery unusable: 80% or 0.8\n\nNow, to find the probability that all three are unusable at the same time, I multiply these probabilities together.\n\nCalculating that:\n\n0.4 (highway) * 0.6 (mountain road) * 0.8 (boat delivery) = ?\n\nLet me do the multiplication step by step:\n\nFirst, multiply 0.4 and 0.6:\n\n0.4 * 0.6 = 0.24\n\nThen, multiply the result by 0.8:\n\n0.24 * 0.8 = 0.192\n\nSo, the probability that all three routes are unusable is 0.192, which is 19.2%.\n\nWait, that seems low. Let me double-check my calculations. 0.4 times 0.6 is indeed 0.24, and 0.24 times 0.8 is 0.192. Okay, that's correct.\n\nNow, thinking about the system's resilience: the town council wants to ensure that at least one supply route remains viable. The probability that all routes are down is 19.2%. That means there's an 80.8% chance (1 - 0.192 = 0.808) that at least one route is still working.\n\nSo, the town's resilience is pretty good because there's an 80.8% chance of having at least one viable route during a storm, which is quite high. This suggests that the system is resilient because the probability of all routes failing together is relatively low.\n\nI think I've covered all the steps. I calculated the joint probability correctly and interpreted the resilience correctly by looking at the complement of that probability.\n</think>\n\nTo find the probability that all three supply routes are unusable simultaneously, we multiply the individual probabilities:\n\n- Highway: 0.4\n- Mountain road: 0.6\n- Boat delivery: 0.8\n\nCalculation:\n0.4 * 0.6 * 0.8 = 0.192 or 19.2%\n\nThis means there's a 19.2% chance all routes are unusable. Therefore, the system's resilience is high as there's an 80.8% chance of at least one route remaining operational.\n\n**Answer:** The probability is 19.2%. This indicates strong resilience since the system rarely fails all routes simultaneously.\n\nDONE."

    "solution": "Solve this problem step by step. End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: A small coastal town has three different supply routes for food and essential goods: a main highway, a secondary road through mountains, and delivery by boat. Historical data shows that during storm season (3 months per year), the probability of each route becoming temporarily unusable is: highway (40%), mountain road (60%), and boat delivery (80%). The town council wants to assess the town's resilience in terms of maintaining at least one viable supply route during storm season. What is the probability that all three supply routes will be simultaneously unusable during a storm, and what does this tell us about the system's resilience? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this probability problem to solve, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and make sure I understand all the parts.\n\nThe problem is about a coastal town with three different supply routes: a main highway, a secondary road through mountains, and delivery by boat. During storm season, which lasts 3 months a year, each route has a certain probability of being temporarily unusable. Specifically, the highway has a 40% chance, the mountain road has a 60% chance, and the boat delivery has an 80% chance of being unusable. The town council wants to assess the town's resilience, which is defined as the probability that at least one supply route remains viable during a storm. They want to know the probability that all three routes are simultaneously unusable and what this tells us about the system's resilience.\n\nHmm, okay. So, to rephrase, I need to find the probability that all three routes are down at the same time during a storm, and then use that to assess the resilience. Resilience here is the probability that at least one route is still working, so essentially 1 minus the probability that all routes are down.\n\nFirst, let's break down the problem. Each route has a probability of being unusable, which is given as:\n\n- Highway: 40% or 0.4\n- Mountain Road: 60% or 0.6\n- Boat Delivery: 80% or 0.8\n\nSince these are independent events (the usability of one route doesn't affect the others), I can calculate the probability that all three are unusable by multiplying their individual probabilities together. That makes sense because for independent events, the probability of all occurring is the product of their probabilities.\n\nSo, let's compute that:\n\nP(all three unusable) = P(highway unusable) * P(mountain road unusable) * P(boat delivery unusable)\n= 0.4 * 0.6 * 0.8\n\nLet me do that multiplication step by step:\n\nFirst, multiply 0.4 and 0.6:\n0.4 * 0.6 = 0.24\n\nThen, multiply the result by 0.8:\n0.24 * 0.8 = 0.192\n\nSo, the probability that all three routes are unusable is 0.192, which is 19.2%.\n\nNow, the town's resilience is the probability that at least one route is still viable. That means it's the complement of the probability that all routes are unusable. So, I can find resilience by subtracting the probability of all routes being down from 1.\n\nResilience = 1 - P(all three unusable)\n= 1 - 0.192\n= 0.808\n\nSo, the resilience is 80.8%.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. If all three routes being unusable is 19.2%, then the probability that at least one is usable is indeed 80.8%. That seems reasonable.\n\nLet me think if there's another way to approach this. Alternatively, I could calculate the probability of each route being usable and then combine them, but that might be more complicated because it involves more calculations. Since the problem is straightforward with all three being unusable, multiplying the probabilities directly is the most efficient method.\n\nAnother way to think about it is using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, but that's typically used when calculating the probability of at least one of several events occurring. In this case, we're interested in the complement, which is all events not occurring, so it's simpler to calculate the probability of all events occurring (all routes being unusable) and subtract that from 1.\n\nYes, that aligns with what I did earlier. So, I'm confident that my calculation is correct.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Probability all three routes are unusable: 0.4 * 0.6 * 0.8 = 0.192 or 19.2%\n- Resilience (at least one route usable): 1 - 0.192 = 0.808 or 80.8%\n\nThis tells us that there's an 80.8% chance that at least one supply route remains viable during a storm, which is quite high. The town's resilience is therefore quite strong, as there's a high probability of having at least one working route to rely on.\n\nI think that covers the problem. I didn't encounter any contradictions or errors in my calculations, so I believe this is the correct approach.\n</think>\n\nThe probability that all three supply routes are simultaneously unusable is 19.2%. This means the town has a resilience level of 80.8%, indicating a strong ability to maintain at least one viable route during storm season.\n\n**Answer:** The probability that all three routes are unusable is 19.2%, and the town's resilience is 80.8%.

So, the probability that all three routes are unusable is 19.2%. \n\nWait, but the question also asks what this tells us about the system's resilience.

That\u2019s pretty good, especially considering the boat delivery route has an 80% chance of being unusable, which is quite high, but the other two routes have lower probabilities.\n\nI think that makes sense.

This indicates that the system's resilience is strong, with an 80.8% chance of maintaining at least one viable route during a storm.\n\nProbability of all routes unusable: 19.2%.  \nResilience: 80.8% chance of at least one route remaining usable.\n\nDONE."
