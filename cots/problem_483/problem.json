  "question": "A small wooden block has a cylindrical hole drilled through it from the front to the back. The block measures 3cm \u00d7 3cm \u00d7 3cm, and the cylindrical hole has a diameter of 1cm. The center of the hole is positioned exactly in the middle of the front face. Draw or describe the top view, front view, and side view of this object in orthographic projection. In which view(s) will the hole be visible as a complete circle? In which view(s) will the hole appear as a rectangle?",
  "answer": "To solve this problem, I need to visualize the three standard orthographic views of the block with the cylindrical hole and analyze how the hole appears in each view.\n\nThe three standard views are:\n\n1. Front view: Looking directly at the front face of the cube\n2. Top view: Looking down at the cube from above\n3. Side view: Looking at the cube from the side (left or right)\n\nAnalysis of each view:\n\nFront view:\n- This shows a 3cm \u00d7 3cm square\n- The cylindrical hole appears as a circle with 1cm diameter\n- The circle is centered in the square (1.5cm from each edge)\n\nTop view:\n- This shows a 3cm \u00d7 3cm square\n- The cylindrical hole appears as a rectangle that is 1cm wide and 3cm long\n- The rectangle is centered horizontally (1cm from each side edge)\n\nSide view:\n- This shows a 3cm \u00d7 3cm square\n- The cylindrical hole appears as a rectangle that is 1cm wide and 3cm long\n- The rectangle is centered vertically (1cm from top and bottom edges)\n\nTherefore:\n- The hole will be visible as a complete circle only in the front view (and also in the back view if we were to include it)\n- The hole will appear as a rectangle in both the top view and the side view\n\nThis occurs because orthographic projection shows the 2D view of what we see from each direction. When looking directly at the front face, we see the circular opening of the cylindrical hole. When looking from the top or side, we see the full length of the hole, which appears as a rectangle because the hole extends through the entire depth of the cube."
