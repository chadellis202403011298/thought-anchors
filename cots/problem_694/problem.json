  "question": "A man lives on the 10th floor of an apartment building. Every morning he takes the elevator down to the ground floor to go to work. When he returns in the evening, he takes the elevator to the 7th floor and then walks up the stairs to reach his apartment on the 10th floor. However, on rainy days and when other people are in the elevator, he goes directly to the 10th floor in the elevator. Why does he normally get off on the 7th floor?",
  "answer": "The man is of short stature and cannot reach the button for the 10th floor in the elevator. He can only reach as high as the 7th floor button. Therefore, on normal days, he must exit at the 7th floor and walk up the remaining three flights of stairs. However, on rainy days, he has his umbrella with him, which he can use to press the 10th floor button. Similarly, when other people are in the elevator with him, they can press the 10th floor button for him, or he can ask them to do so. This problem requires lateral thinking because it involves looking beyond the obvious explanations and considering unusual constraints that might explain the man's behavior."
