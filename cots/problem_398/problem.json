  "question": "A traveler arrives at a fork in the road. One path leads to a village of truth-tellers who always tell the truth, and the other path leads to a village of liars who always lie. Standing at the fork is a resident from one of these villages, but the traveler doesn't know which village the person is from. The traveler can ask only one question to determine which path leads to the truth-tellers' village. What single question should the traveler ask?",
  "answer": "The traveler should ask: 'If I were to ask you which path leads to your village, which path would you point to?'\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. First, let's analyze what happens with this question for both types of residents:\n\n2. If the person is a truth-teller:\n   - They would honestly point to their own village (the truth-tellers' village) if asked directly.\n   - When asked 'which path would you point to,' they truthfully report that they would point to the truth-tellers' village.\n\n3. If the person is a liar:\n   - They would dishonestly point to the truth-tellers' village (not their own) if asked directly.\n   - When asked 'which path would you point to,' they falsely report the opposite of what they would actually do, so they would not point to the truth-tellers' village.\n\n4. The key insight is that a liar will lie about what they would say, creating a double negative that effectively cancels out the lie.\n\n5. Therefore, regardless of whether the person is a truth-teller or a liar, the path they do NOT point to is the path to the truth-tellers' village.\n\n6. The traveler should take the opposite path from the one indicated in the answer.\n\nThis solution demonstrates lateral thinking because it approaches the problem indirectly, using a self-referential question that works regardless of who is being asked, rather than trying to determine the person's identity first."
