  "question": "A game show has 5 identical boxes. One box contains a car key (grand prize), three boxes contain $100 bills, and one box contains nothing. A contestant randomly selects one box at a time without replacement. After each selection, the contestant can either keep what's in the box or continue selecting. If the contestant decides to continue, they forfeit whatever was in the previously selected box. The contestant's goal is to get the car key. What is the optimal strategy for the contestant, and what is the probability of winning the car with this strategy?",
  "answer": "Let's analyze this problem using probability distributions and expected value.\n\nFirst, let's consider the available strategies:\n1. Always open exactly 1 box\n2. Always open exactly 2 boxes\n3. Always open exactly 3 boxes\n4. Always open exactly 4 boxes\n5. Always open all 5 boxes\n6. Use a conditional strategy (open more boxes only if we haven't found the car key yet)\n\nSince the boxes are selected randomly without replacement, and we only care about getting the car key, the optimal strategy is straightforward: if we see the car key, take it; otherwise, continue opening boxes.\n\nInitially, the car key is in 1 of 5 boxes, so the probability of finding it in the first box is 1/5 = 0.2.\n\nIf we don't find the car key in the first box (probability 4/5), we continue. Now the car key is in 1 of the 4 remaining boxes, so the probability of finding it in the second box is 1/4.\n\nThe total probability of finding the car key in the second box is the probability of not finding it in the first box AND finding it in the second box: (4/5) \u00d7 (1/4) = 4/20 = 0.2.\n\nFollowing the same logic for the remaining boxes:\n\nProbability of finding the car key in the third box: (4/5) \u00d7 (3/4) \u00d7 (1/3) = 4/20 = 0.2\nProbability of finding the car key in the fourth box: (4/5) \u00d7 (3/4) \u00d7 (2/3) \u00d7 (1/2) = 4/20 = 0.2\nProbability of finding the car key in the fifth box: (4/5) \u00d7 (3/4) \u00d7 (2/3) \u00d7 (1/2) \u00d7 (1/1) = 4/20 = 0.2\n\nInterestingly, the probability of finding the car key is uniformly distributed across all five boxes, with a 0.2 probability for each box.\n\nThe optimal strategy is to keep opening boxes until you find the car key, and the probability of winning the car with this strategy is 1 (certainty) if you can open all boxes, since the car key must be in one of them.\n\nHowever, if the question asks for the probability of winning with the optimal strategy (which is to always continue until you find the car key), then the answer is simply 1.0 or 100%, as you will eventually find the box with the car key if you open all boxes if necessary."
