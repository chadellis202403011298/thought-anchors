  "question": "You're deciding between two restaurants for dinner tonight. Restaurant A has 80 reviews with an average rating of 4 stars. Restaurant B has 20 reviews with an average rating of 4.5 stars. Assuming the ratings are honest reflections of quality and that you want to maximize your chances of having a good dining experience, which restaurant should you choose? Explain your reasoning based on confidence in the ratings.",
  "answer": "To solve this problem, I need to consider both the average ratings and the sample sizes to make a decision under uncertainty.\n\n1) Restaurant A: 80 reviews, 4.0 stars average\n2) Restaurant B: 20 reviews, 4.5 stars average\n\nWhile Restaurant B has a higher average rating (4.5 vs 4.0), this average comes from significantly fewer reviews (20 vs 80). With fewer reviews, there's greater uncertainty about Restaurant B's true quality - the 4.5 average could be due to chance or sampling error.\n\nTo make a decision under uncertainty, I should consider how confident I can be in each average rating. With 80 reviews, Restaurant A's 4.0 rating is likely to be closer to its true quality level. The larger sample size provides greater statistical confidence.\n\nRestaurant B's higher rating is promising but less reliable due to the smaller sample size. The true quality might be higher than Restaurant A, but there's more uncertainty.\n\nFor an easy-level decision framework: I would choose Restaurant A because its rating is based on a larger sample size, making it more reliable, even though it's slightly lower. The additional 60 reviews provide more confidence that I'll actually experience quality close to the 4.0 rating, whereas Restaurant B's limited reviews make its 4.5 rating less dependable.\n\nThis illustrates a key principle in decision-making under uncertainty: sometimes a more certain but slightly lower expected outcome is preferable to a potentially higher but more uncertain outcome."
