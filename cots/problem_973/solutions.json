After researching options, they found that each bookshelf costs $75, each children's book costs $15, and each small beanbag chair costs $40. The library director has determined they need at least 3 bookshelves to organize the current collection, at least 10 new books to expand offerings, and at least 2 beanbag chairs for the children to sit on while reading. How can the library optimize their spending to meet all these minimum requirements while staying within their $500 budget? What's the maximum number of additional books they could purchase with any remaining funds? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I've got this problem where a small community library received a $500 donation to improve their children's section. They need to buy new bookshelves, children's books, and some beanbag chairs. The goal is to figure out the optimal way to spend this money to meet all their minimum requirements while staying within the budget, and also find out the maximum number of additional books they can purchase with any leftover funds.\n\nFirst, let's break down the requirements. They need at least 3 bookshelves, 10 new books, and 2 beanbag chairs. Each bookshelf costs $75, each book is $15, and each beanbag chair is $40. So, I need to calculate the total cost for these minimum items and see how much money is left after that.\n\nStarting with the bookshelves: 3 bookshelves at $75 each. Let me calculate that: 3 * 75 = $225. Okay, so that's $225 spent on bookshelves.\n\nNext, the children's books: they need at least 10 books. Each book costs $15, so 10 books would cost 10 * 15 = $150. So, adding that to the previous total: $225 + $150 = $375.\n\nNow, the beanbag chairs: they need at least 2. Each chair is $40, so 2 chairs would cost 2 * 40 = $80. Adding this to the previous total: $375 + $80 = $455.\n\nSo, the total minimum expenditure for the required items is $455. They have a budget of $500, so the remaining money is $500 - $455 = $45.\n\nNow, the question is, how can they optimize their spending? I think this means they should use the remaining $45 in a way that either buys more of the items they need or maybe invests in something else that benefits them the most. But since they've already met all the minimum requirements, the only thing left is to see if they can buy more of the items they already need or perhaps get extra beanbags or books.\n\nBut wait, the problem also asks for the maximum number of additional books they could purchase with any remaining funds. So, after meeting the minimum requirements, they have $45 left. If they want to buy more books, each additional book costs $15. So, how many can they buy with $45?\n\nLet me calculate that: $45 / $15 per book = 3 additional books. So, they could buy 3 more books, making the total books 10 + 3 = 13 books.\n\nBut hold on, maybe there's a better way to allocate the remaining money to get more books or perhaps more beanbag chairs or bookshelves. Let's explore that.\n\nFirst, let's see if buying extra bookshelves would allow more books. Each bookshelf can hold multiple books, but the number of books isn't directly tied to the number of bookshelves unless they're trying to maximize the number of books per shelf, which isn't specified here. The problem only mentions that they need 3 bookshelves, so unless they need more, they don't have to buy more. So, buying extra bookshelves doesn't directly help with buying more books, but it does use up money that could have been spent on books.\n\nSimilarly, buying extra beanbag chairs would use up the remaining $45. Each chair is $40, so with $45, they could buy 1 extra chair at $40, leaving $5 unused. But that's not as efficient as buying books since $40 buys one chair, whereas $40 could buy 2 additional books (since 40 /15=2.666, so 2 books). So, buying an extra beanbag chair would cost $40, giving them 2 chairs instead of 3, but that leaves $5 unused, which isn't enough for another book. Alternatively, buying 2 more books would cost $30, leaving $15, which isn't enough for another beanbag chair or bookshelf.\n\nAlternatively, they could buy 3 beanbag chairs, but that would cost 3*40=120, which is way more than the remaining $45. So that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe buying a combination of an extra bookshelf and some books or chairs. Let's see.\n\nIf they buy 1 extra bookshelf, that's $75. But they only have $45 left, so that's not possible. So, they can't buy more bookshelves.\n\nWhat about buying 1 extra beanbag chair and some books? 1 chair is $40, leaving $5, which isn't enough for a book. So, they could buy 1 extra chair and then use the remaining $5, but that's not enough.\n\nAlternatively, buying 0 extra chairs and using all $45 on books. So, 45 /15=3 books. So, that's 3 additional books.\n\nAlternatively, buying 1 extra chair ($40) and then with $5 left, they can't buy any more books, so total books would still be 10.\n\nAlternatively, buying 2 extra chairs would cost 80, which is more than $45, so that's not possible.\n\nSo, the best option seems to be to buy as many additional books as possible with the remaining $45, which is 3 books.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to allocate the remaining money differently to get more books. For example, if they don't buy the minimum required items, but that's not allowed because they need at least 3 bookshelves, 10 books, and 2 chairs. So, they can't reduce the number of any of these below the minimum.\n\nTherefore, the optimal spending is to meet the minimum requirements and then use the remaining $45 to buy as many additional books as possible, which is 3 books.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n- 3 bookshelves: 3*75=225\n\n- 10 books:10*15=150\n\n- 2 chairs:2*40=80\n\nTotal:225+150+80=455\n\nRemaining:500-455=45\n\nWith $45, buy 3 more books:3*15=45\n\nTotal expenditure:455+45=500\n\nSo, they meet all the minimum requirements, and they have 13 books, 3 bookshelves, and 2 chairs.\n\nAlternatively, if they prefer, they could buy 1 extra chair and 2 books, but that would leave more money unused, which isn't optimal.\n\nWait, let's check that. If they buy 1 extra chair ($40) and 2 books ($30), that's 40+30=70, but they only have $45 left. So, that's not possible because 70>45. So, they can't do that.\n\nAlternatively, buying 1 chair and 2 books would require $40 + 2*15=40+30=70, which is more than $45, so that's not possible.\n\nSo, the only feasible way is to buy 3 more books.\n\nAlternatively, they could buy 1 extra bookshelf, but that's $75, which is more than the $45 they have left, so that's not possible.\n\nTherefore, the optimal way is to buy the minimum required items and then use the remaining $45 to buy 3 additional books.\n\nSo, the maximum number of additional books they could purchase is 3.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is that they can purchase 3 additional books, making the total books 13, and the total expenditure $500.\n</think>\n\nThe library should purchase the minimum required items and use the remaining $45 to buy additional books. \n\n- **Bookshelves:** 3 at $75 each = $225\n- **Books:** 10 at $15 each + 3 additional books = $150 + $45 = $195\n- **Beanbag Chairs:** 2 at $40 each = $80\n- **Total Expenditure:** $225 + $195 + $80 = $500\n\n**Maximum Additional Books:** 3\n\nDONE."

They want to improve their children's section by buying new bookshelves, children's books, and some beanbag chairs. The goal is to figure out how they can spend this money in a way that meets all their minimum requirements while staying within the budget, and then determine the maximum number of additional books they can buy with any remaining funds.\n\nFirst, let's break down the problem. The library needs at least 3 bookshelves, at least 10 new books, and at least 2 beanbag chairs. Each bookshelf costs $75, each book is $15, and each beanbag chair is $40. They have $500 in total. So, the first step is to calculate the total minimum cost for these required items and then see how much money is left for additional purchases.\n\nLet me start by calculating the cost of the minimum required items.\n\nFor the bookshelves:\nThey need at least 3. Each one is $75, so 3 times 75 is:\n3 * $75 = $225.\n\nFor the children's books:\nThey need at least 10. Each book is $15, so 10 times 15 is:\n10 * $15 = $150.\n\nFor the beanbag chairs:\nThey need at least 2. Each chair is $40, so 2 times 40 is:\n2 * $40 = $80.\n\nNow, adding these up gives the total minimum cost:\n$225 (bookshelves) + $150 (books) + $80 (beanbags) = $455.\n\nWait, that's interesting. $455 is less than $500. So, the library can meet the minimum requirements within the budget. That means there's some money left over to spend on additional items.\n\nTo find out how much money is left, subtract the total minimum cost from the total budget:\n$500 - $455 = $45.\n\nSo, they have $45 left after purchasing the required items.\n\nNow, the question is, how can they optimize their spending to meet all these minimum requirements and then use the remaining $45 to buy as many additional books as possible?\n\nSince the library wants to maximize the number of additional books, they should allocate as much of the remaining $45 to buying books. Each additional book costs $15, so let's see how many they can buy with $45.\n\nNumber of additional books = $45 / $15 = 3.\n\nSo, they can buy 3 more books with the remaining money.\n\nWait, but let me double-check that. If they have $45, and each book is $15, then 45 divided by 15 is indeed 3. So, they can buy 3 additional books.\n\nAlternatively, could they buy more beanbag chairs or bookshelves with the remaining money? But the problem specifies that they need to meet the minimum requirements, so they already have the necessary 3 bookshelves, 10 books, and 2 beanbags. The remaining money should be allocated to maximize the number of additional books, which is 3.\n\nSo, the optimized spending would be:\n\n- 3 bookshelves: 3 * $75 = $225\n- 10 books: 10 * $15 = $150\n- 2 beanbags: 2 * $40 = $80\n- Total: $225 + $150 + $80 = $455\n- Remaining money: $500 - $455 = $45\n- Additional books: $45 / $15 = 3\n\nTherefore, they can buy 3 more books with the remaining $45.\n\nSo, the maximum number of additional books they could purchase is 3.\n</think>\n\nThe library can allocate the $500 budget as follows to meet all minimum requirements and maximize the number of additional books:\n\n- **Bookshelves:** 3 units at $75 each: 3 \u00d7 $75 = $225\n- **Children's Books:** 10 units at $15 each: 10 \u00d7 $15 = $150\n- **Beanbag Chairs:** 2 units at $40 each: 2 \u00d7 $40 = $80\n- **Total Minimum Expenditure:** $225 + $150 + $80 = $455\n- **Remaining Budget:** $500 - $455 = $45\n- **Additional Books Purchased:** $45 / $15 = 3 units\n\n**Maximum Number of Additional Books:** 3\n\nDONE."

How can the library optimize their spending to meet all these minimum requirements while staying within their $500 budget? What's the maximum number of additional books they could purchase with any remaining funds? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I need to help this small community library figure out how to spend their $500 donation optimally. They want to buy bookshelves, children's books, and beanbag chairs. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's list out the requirements:\n\n1. **Bookshelves:** They need at least 3.\n2. **Children's books:** At least 10 new ones.\n3. **Beanbag chairs:** At least 2.\n\nEach bookshelf costs $75, each book is $15, and each beanbag is $40.\n\nThe total budget is $500, so I need to figure out how to allocate this money across the three items without exceeding the budget. Plus, once they've met the minimum requirements, they want to know the maximum number of additional books they can buy with any remaining money.\n\nLet me start by calculating the minimum costs for each item:\n\n- **Bookshelves:** 3 * $75 = $225\n- **Children's books:** 10 * $15 = $150\n- **Beanbag chairs:** 2 * $40 = $80\n\nAdding these up: 225 + 150 + 80 = $455\n\nSo, with the minimum purchases, they spend $455. That leaves them with $500 - $455 = $45 remaining.\n\nNow, the question is, how can they use this remaining $45 to maximize the number of additional books they can buy? Since each additional book costs $15, I can divide the remaining money by the cost per book to see how many they can get.\n\n$45 / $15 = 3\n\nSo, they can buy 3 additional books with the leftover money.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem says \"with any remaining funds,\" so maybe there's a way to adjust the number of bookshelves or beanbag chairs to get more books? Let me explore that.\n\nIf they reduce the number of bookshelves, they can save money for more books. Let's see:\n\n- If they buy 2 bookshelves instead of 3, that's 2 * $75 = $150 saved.\n\nBut then, they need at least 3 bookshelves. So they can't go below 3. Hmm.\n\nWhat about beanbag chairs? They need at least 2. If they reduce to 1, that's $40 saved.\n\nSo, let's recalculate:\n\n- Bookshelves: 3 * $75 = $225\n- Beanbag chairs: 1 * $40 = $40\n- Books: 10 + x\n\nTotal cost: 225 + 40 + 15x \u2264 $500\n\nSo, 265 + 15x \u2264 500\n\n15x \u2264 235\n\nx \u2264 15.666... So, x = 15\n\nWait, that would mean buying 15 additional books, but that doesn't seem right because earlier, I thought they had only $45 left. Let me check the math again.\n\nWait, if they reduce beanbag chairs to 1, that's a saving of $40. So the initial calculation was 3 bookshelves ($225), 10 books ($150), 2 beanbags ($80). Total $455. If they save $40 by buying only 1 beanbag, then the total spent would be $455 - $40 = $415. Then, they have $500 - $415 = $85 left.\n\nWith $85, they can buy additional books: 85 / 15 \u2248 5.666, so 5 more books.\n\nWait, that's better than before. So by reducing beanbags from 2 to 1, they can get 5 additional books instead of 3.\n\nIs there a way to reduce bookshelves further? But they need at least 3, so they can't go below that.\n\nAlternatively, what if they reduce both beanbags and bookshelves? Let's see:\n\n- Bookshelves: 3 * $75 = $225\n- Beanbags: 1 * $40 = $40\n- Books: 10 + x\n\nTotal: 225 + 40 + 150 + 15x = 415 + 15x \u2264 500\n\nSo, 15x \u2264 85\n\nx \u2264 5.666, so x=5\n\nThat's the same as before.\n\nAlternatively, what if they reduce beanbags to 1 and buy more books, but also see if they can buy more beanbags later? Wait, no, because they need at least 2 beanbags.\n\nSo, the optimal way is to reduce beanbags to 1, allowing more money for books.\n\nWait, but let me confirm:\n\nOriginal minimum expenditure: 3 shelves, 10 books, 2 beanbags = $455\n\nRemaining: $45\n\nWith $45, they can buy 3 more books.\n\nIf they instead buy 1 beanbag, then:\n\nTotal expenditure: 3 shelves + 10 books + 1 beanbag = 225 + 150 + 40 = $415\n\nRemaining: $85\n\nThen, they can buy 85 /15 \u22485.666, so 5 more books.\n\nSo total books bought: 15, which is better.\n\nIs there a way to reduce bookshelves further? No, because they need at least 3.\n\nAlternatively, what if they reduce beanbags to 1, and see if they can also reduce bookshelves? But they can't go below 3.\n\nSo, the best option is to buy 3 shelves, 15 books, and 1 beanbag.\n\nTotal cost: 3*75 +15*15 +1*40=225+225+40=490\n\nWait, that's over the budget. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 3 shelves:225, 15 books:225, 1 beanbag:40. Total 225+225+40=490, which is over $500. Oops, that's a mistake.\n\nWait, I think I miscalculated. Let me correct that.\n\nIf they buy 3 shelves, 15 books, and 1 beanbag:\n\nShelves: 3*75=225\n\nBooks:15*15=225\n\nBeanbags:1*40=40\n\nTotal:225+225+40=490, which is over $500. So that's not possible.\n\nWait, so maybe reducing beanbags alone isn't enough. Let me recalculate.\n\nIf they reduce beanbags to 1, total minimum expenditure is 3 shelves + 10 books +1 beanbag=225+150+40=415\n\nThen, remaining=500-415=85\n\nSo they can buy 85/15\u22485.666, so 5 more books.\n\nTotal books:10+5=15\n\nTotal expenditure:3 shelves +15 books +1 beanbag=225+225+40=490\n\nStill over by $10.\n\nWait, that's a problem. So maybe they need to adjust differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they can reduce the number of shelves by 1, so 2 shelves, and then use the saved money for more books and beanbags.\n\nLet's see:\n\n2 shelves:2*75=150\n\n10 books:150\n\n2 beanbags:80\n\nTotal:150+150+80=380\n\nRemaining:500-380=120\n\nThen, they can buy additional books:120/15=8\n\nSo total books:10+8=18\n\nTotal expenditure:2 shelves +18 books +2 beanbags=150+270+80=500\n\nThat works perfectly.\n\nSo, in this case, they can buy 18 books, which is more than the previous 15.\n\nAlternatively, let's see other combinations.\n\nWhat if they buy 3 shelves, 2 beanbags, and 10+ books.\n\nTotal minimum:3*75 +2*40 +10*15=225+80+150=455\n\nRemaining:45\n\nThey can buy 3 more books, making total books 13.\n\nBut that's less than 18.\n\nAlternatively, what if they buy 3 shelves, 1 beanbag, and 15 books.\n\nTotal:225+40+225=490, which is over the budget.\n\nSo, that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe buy 3 shelves, 10 books, 2 beanbags, and then use the remaining $45 for more books.\n\nBut 45/15=3, so 13 books total.\n\nBut that's less than buying 2 shelves, 2 beanbags, and 18 books.\n\nWait, no, in the 2 shelves scenario, they can buy 18 books without exceeding the budget.\n\nSo, that seems better.\n\nLet me confirm:\n\n2 shelves:2*75=150\n\n18 books:18*15=270\n\n2 beanbags:2*40=80\n\nTotal:150+270+80=500\n\nPerfect.\n\nSo, this way, they meet the minimum requirements:\n\n- At least 3 bookshelves: Wait, but they bought only 2. Oh, that's a problem.\n\nWait, the library director said they need at least 3 bookshelves. So they can't go below 3.\n\nSo, the previous idea of buying 2 shelves is invalid because they need at least 3.\n\nOops, that changes things.\n\nSo, they have to buy at least 3 shelves.\n\nTherefore, the previous approach where they bought 3 shelves, 10 books, and 2 beanbags, with $45 left, which allows 3 more books, is the way to go.\n\nSo, total books:13.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a better way.\n\nWhat if they buy 3 shelves, 10 books, 2 beanbags:455\n\nRemaining:45\n\nThey can buy 3 more books, making it 13.\n\nAlternatively, if they reduce beanbags to 1, saving $40, then they have 415, leaving 85.\n\nWith 85, they can buy 5 more books, making total books 15.\n\nBut let's see the total expenditure:\n\n3 shelves +15 books +1 beanbag=225+225+40=490, which is over the budget by $10.\n\nSo, that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they can adjust both beanbags and shelves.\n\nWait, but they need at least 3 shelves, so they can't reduce that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe buy 3 shelves, 10 books, 1 beanbag, and then have 500-225-150-40=85 left, which allows 5 more books.\n\nBut that's 15 books.\n\nWait, but 225+150+40=415, plus 5*15=75, total 415+75=490, which is still over by $10.\n\nHmm, so that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe buy 3 shelves, 10 books, 2 beanbags, and 3 more books, totaling 13 books, spending $455 + 45=500.\n\nYes, that works.\n\nSo, the maximum number of additional books they can buy is 3, making total books 13.\n\nBut wait, is there a way to buy more books?\n\nIf they reduce beanbags to 1, they can save $40, but that would require buying 15 books, which would cost 15*15=225, plus 3 shelves (225) and 1 beanbag (40), totaling 225+225+40=490, which is over.\n\nAlternatively, maybe reduce beanbags to 1, and reduce shelves to 3, but that doesn't help.\n\nWait, perhaps they can buy 3 shelves, 10 books, 1 beanbag, and then have $500 - 225 -150 -40=85 left.\n\nWith 85, they can buy 5 more books, making it 15 books.\n\nBut 225+150+40+75=500, which is exactly the budget.\n\nWait, but 225+150+40=415, plus 75=500.\n\nYes, that works.\n\nSo, total books:15\n\nBut wait, 15 books is more than the previous 13.\n\nSo, how?\n\nLet me recalculate:\n\n3 shelves:225\n\n15 books:225\n\n1 beanbag:40\n\nTotal:225+225+40=490\n\nWait, that's over by $10.\n\nWait, no, 225+225+40=490, which is under 500. Wait, 225+225=450, plus 40=490. So, they have $10 left.\n\nBut they can't buy more books because each book is $15, and they have only $10 left, which isn't enough.\n\nSo, that doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe buy 3 shelves, 14 books, and 1 beanbag.\n\n14 books:14*15=210\n\nTotal:225+210+40=475\n\nRemaining:25, which isn't enough for another book.\n\nSo, they can only buy 14 books.\n\nBut that's worse than buying 13 books with the original approach.\n\nWait, so maybe the best option is to buy 3 shelves, 10 books, 2 beanbags, and then 3 more books, totaling 13 books, spending exactly $500.\n\nYes, that works.\n\nSo, in that case, the maximum number of additional books is 3, making the total books 13.\n\nBut wait, earlier, I thought reducing beanbags to 1 would allow more books, but it seems it's not possible because it goes over the budget.\n\nSo, the optimal way is to buy the minimum required items and then spend the remaining money on additional books.\n\nTherefore, the solution is:\n\n- 3 bookshelves:3*75=225\n\n- 10 books:10*15=150\n\n- 2 beanbags:2*40=80\n\nTotal:225+150+80=455\n\nRemaining:45\n\n45/15=3, so buy 3 more books.\n\nTotal books:13\n\nTotal expenditure:225+153+80=458? Wait, no.\n\nWait, 3 shelves:225\n\n10+3=13 books:13*15=195\n\n2 beanbags:80\n\nTotal:225+195+80=500\n\nYes, that works.\n\nSo, the maximum number of additional books is 3.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought that reducing beanbags to 1 would allow more books, but it seems it's not possible because it exceeds the budget.\n\nTherefore, the optimal solution is to buy 3 shelves, 13 books, and 2 beanbags, spending exactly $500.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm:\n\n3 shelves:3*75=225\n\n13 books:13*15=195\n\n2 beanbags:2*40=80\n\nTotal:225+195+80=500\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the library can buy 3 shelves, 13 books, and 2 beanbags, meeting all their requirements and staying within the budget. Additionally, they can't buy more books without exceeding the budget, so 3 is the maximum number of additional books they can purchase.\n</think>\n\nThe library can purchase 3 bookshelves, 13 children's books, and 2 beanbag chairs, using the entire $500 budget. They can buy 3 additional books beyond the initial 10 required.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThey can buy 3 bookshelves, 13 children's books, and 2 beanbag chairs, spending exactly $500. The maximum number of additional books they can purchase is 3.\n\nDONE."

They need to purchase new bookshelves, children's books, and some comfortable seating. After researching options, they found that each bookshelf costs $75, each children's book costs $15, and each small beanbag chair costs $40. The library director has determined they need at least 3 bookshelves to organize the current collection, at least 10 new books to expand offerings, and at least 2 beanbag chairs for the children to sit on while reading. How can the library optimize their spending to meet all these minimum requirements while staying within their $500 budget? What's the maximum number of additional books they could purchase with any remaining funds? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so the community library has this $500 donation to improve their children's section. They need to buy bookshelves, children's books, and beanbag chairs. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's figure out the costs. Each bookshelf is $75, each book is $15, and each beanbag chair is $40. The library needs at least 3 bookshelves, 10 new books, and 2 beanbag chairs. So, let me calculate the minimum cost for these required items.\n\nFor the bookshelves: 3 bookshelves \u00d7 $75 each = $225.\n\nFor the books: 10 books \u00d7 $15 each = $150.\n\nFor the beanbags: 2 beanbag chairs \u00d7 $40 each = $80.\n\nAdding these up: $225 + $150 + $80 = $455.\n\nHmm, that's within the $500 budget, so they have some leftover money. Let's see how much is left: $500 - $455 = $45.\n\nNow, the question is, how can they maximize the number of additional books they can buy with that remaining $45? Since each book is $15, let's divide $45 by $15.\n\n$45 \u00f7 $15 = 3.\n\nSo, they can buy 3 more books. That means the total number of books they can purchase is 10 (required) + 3 (additional) = 13 books.\n\nLet me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 3\u00d775 is 225, 10\u00d715 is 150, 2\u00d740 is 80. Adding those gives 225+150=375, plus 80 is 455. The remaining is 500-455=45. Dividing 45 by 15 gives 3. Yep, that seems right.\n\nSo, they can buy 3 additional books, making it 13 in total. They meet all the minimum requirements and stay within the budget.\n</think>\n\nTo optimize the library's spending while meeting all requirements, they should purchase exactly 3 bookshelves, 10 new books, and 2 beanbag chairs. The total expenditure is $455, leaving $45 to purchase additional books. With $45, they can buy 3 more books, resulting in a total of 13 books.\n\n**Answer:**\nThe library can purchase 3 bookshelves, 10 new books, 2 beanbag chairs, and 3 additional books, totaling 13 books. They will spend $455 and have $45 remaining, allowing them to buy 3 more books. \n\nDONE."

How can the library optimize their spending to meet all these minimum requirements while staying within their $500 budget? What's the maximum number of additional books they could purchase with any remaining funds? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I need to help this small community library optimize their spending to meet all their minimum requirements while staying within a $500 budget. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's list out all the requirements and their costs:\n\n1. **Bookshelves**: They need at least 3. Each one costs $75.\n2. **Children's Books**: They need at least 10 new ones. Each costs $15.\n3. **Beanbag Chairs**: They need at least 2. Each small one costs $40.\n\nThe total budget is $500. So, I should calculate the minimum cost for these required items first to see how much money is left for additional purchases.\n\nStarting with the bookshelves:\n- 3 bookshelves \u00d7 $75 each = 3 \u00d7 75 = $225\n\nNext, the children's books:\n- 10 books \u00d7 $15 each = 10 \u00d7 15 = $150\n\nThen, the beanbag chairs:\n- 2 chairs \u00d7 $40 each = 2 \u00d7 40 = $80\n\nNow, let's add these up to see how much of the budget is used:\n- $225 (bookshelves) + $150 (books) + $80 (chairs) = $455\n\nHmm, so if they buy exactly the minimum required, they will have spent $455. That leaves some money left for additional purchases. Let me calculate the remaining budget:\n\n- Total budget: $500\n- Used: $455\n- Remaining: $500 - $455 = $45\n\nSo, they have $45 left to spend. The question is, how can they optimize this? I think optimization here means using the remaining money in a way that allows them to get the most value or the most items, perhaps.\n\nBut wait, the problem also asks what's the maximum number of additional books they could purchase with any remaining funds. So, if they have $45 left, how many more books can they buy?\n\nEach additional book costs $15. So:\n\n- Number of additional books = $45 \u00f7 $15 per book = 3 books\n\nSo, they can buy 3 more books, making the total books purchased 13.\n\nBut let me double-check that. If they have $45, and each book is $15, then 45 divided by 15 is 3. So yes, they can buy 3 more books.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"at least 10 new books,\" so if they buy 10, they can also buy 3 more, making it 13.\n\nIs there a better way to allocate the remaining $45? Let me think. Maybe instead of buying more books, they could buy more beanbag chairs or bookshelves, but the problem specifies that they need at least 3 bookshelves, 10 books, and 2 chairs. So, they can't go below those numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they could buy more chairs or more bookshelves, but that would require more money, and they only have $45 left. Let's see:\n\n- Each additional book: $15\n- Each additional chair: $40\n- Each additional bookshelf: $75\n\nIf they try to buy more chairs, say one more, that would cost $40, leaving $5, which isn't enough for a book or another chair. Similarly, buying another bookshelf would cost $75, which is more than the remaining $45.\n\nSo, the best use of the remaining money is to buy more books, specifically 3 more, to reach 13 books.\n\nTherefore, the optimized purchase would be:\n\n- 3 bookshelves\n- 13 children's books\n- 2 beanbag chairs\n\nTotal cost: $225 + (13\u00d7$15) + $80 = $225 + $195 + $80 = $500\n\nYes, that adds up perfectly. So, they meet all their minimum requirements and have no money left over. If they had more money, they could buy more chairs or bookshelves, but with the given budget, this is the optimal allocation.\n\nWait, let me double-check the math to be sure:\n\n- Bookshelves: 3 \u00d7 75 = 225\n- Books: 13 \u00d7 15 = 195\n- Chairs: 2 \u00d7 40 = 80\n- Total: 225 + 195 + 80 = 500\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, the maximum number of additional books they can purchase is 3, making the total books 13.\n</think>\n\nThe library should purchase 3 bookshelves, 13 children's books, and 2 beanbag chairs, using the entire $500 budget. This allows them to meet all minimum requirements and have no remaining funds. \n\nThe maximum number of additional books they can purchase is **3**.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe library should buy 3 bookshelves, 13 children's books, and 2 beanbag chairs, and they can purchase an additional 3 books.

How can the library optimize their spending to meet all these minimum requirements while staying within their $500 budget? What's the maximum number of additional books they could purchase with any remaining funds? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem where a small community library received $500 to improve their children's section. They need to buy bookshelves, children's books, and beanbag chairs. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's list out what they need:\n\n1. **Bookshelves**: At least 3.\n2. **Children's books**: At least 10.\n3. **Beanbag chairs**: At least 2.\n\nEach bookshelf costs $75, each book is $15, and each beanbag chair is $40. They have a total budget of $500.\n\nMy goal is to figure out how to spend this money in a way that meets all the minimum requirements while possibly leaving some money left over for extra books. Then, I need to find out the maximum number of additional books they can buy with any remaining funds.\n\nLet me start by calculating the total cost for the minimum items.\n\n**Calculating Minimum Expenditure:**\n\n- **Bookshelves**: 3 * $75 = $225\n- **Books**: 10 * $15 = $150\n- **Beanbag chairs**: 2 * $40 = $80\n\nAdding these up: $225 + $150 + $80 = $455\n\nSo, the minimum expenditure is $455. Now, subtracting this from the total budget: $500 - $455 = $45\n\nThis means they have $45 left after meeting all the minimum requirements.\n\nNow, the question is, how can they use this remaining $45 to get more books? Since each book costs $15, let's see how many additional books they can buy with $45.\n\n**Calculating Additional Books:**\n\n$45 / $15 per book = 3 books.\n\nSo, they can buy 3 more books.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n- 3 bookshelves: 3 * 75 = 225\n- 10 books: 10 * 15 = 150\n- 2 beanbags: 2 * 40 = 80\n- Total: 225 + 150 + 80 = 455\n- Remaining: 500 - 455 = 45\n- Additional books: 45 / 15 = 3\n\nThat seems correct. So, they can buy 3 more books with the remaining money.\n\nIs there a way to optimize this differently? For example, maybe buying more beanbags or bookshelves instead of books? But the problem specifically asks for the maximum number of additional books, so it's better to spend the remaining money on books.\n\nLet me see if buying more of one item allows them to have more books. Suppose they buy more beanbags instead of bookshelves. Let's say they buy 4 beanbags instead of 2. That would cost 4 * 40 = $160. But then, the total expenditure would be 225 (bookshelves) + 150 (books) + 160 (beanbags) = 535, which is over the budget. So, that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, if they buy an extra bookshelf, that's 4 bookshelves at 75 each, totaling 300. Then, books at 10 * 15 = 150, beanbags at 2 * 40 = 80. Total would be 300 + 150 + 80 = 530, which is also over the budget.\n\nSo, it seems that sticking to the minimum required items and using the remaining money for books is the optimal way.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of additional books they can purchase is 3.\n</think>\n\nThey can purchase 3 additional books with the remaining funds.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify Minimum Requirements:**\n   - 3 bookshelves at $75 each: 3 \u00d7 $75 = $225\n   - 10 children's books at $15 each: 10 \u00d7 $15 = $150\n   - 2 beanbag chairs at $40 each: 2 \u00d7 $40 = $80\n\n2. **Calculate Total Minimum Expenditure:**\n   - $225 (bookshelves) + $150 (books) + $80 (beanbags) = $455\n\n3. **Determine Remaining Budget:**\n   - $500 (total) - $455 (minimum) = $45\n\n4. **Calculate Additional Books with Remaining Funds:**\n   - $45 / $15 per book = 3 books\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - Maximum number of additional books: 3\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe library can purchase 3 additional books, making the total books 13. The optimized spending is $455 on required items, leaving $45 for 3 more books. DONE."

What's the maximum number of additional books they could purchase with any remaining funds? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I need to help this small community library optimize their spending to meet all their minimum requirements and see how many extra books they can buy with the remaining money. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's list out all the requirements and their costs:\n\n1. **Bookshelves:** They need at least 3. Each costs $75.\n2. **Children's Books:** They need at least 10. Each costs $15.\n3. **Beanbag Chairs:** They need at least 2. Each costs $40.\n\nThey have a total budget of $500. So, I need to calculate the total minimum cost for these items and see how much is left after that. Then, with the remaining money, they can buy additional books or maybe even more beanbags or shelves if it fits within the budget.\n\nLet's start by calculating the minimum cost for each required item.\n\n**Bookshelves:**\n- 3 bookshelves \u00d7 $75 each = $225.\n\n**Children's Books:**\n- 10 books \u00d7 $15 each = $150.\n\n**Beanbag Chairs:**\n- 2 chairs \u00d7 $40 each = $80.\n\nNow, let's add these up to see how much the minimum expenditure would be.\n\n$225 (shelves) + $150 (books) + $80 (chairs) = $455.\n\nHmm, $455 is less than $500, so there's a remaining amount. Let me calculate the remaining money.\n\n$500 total budget - $455 minimum expenditure = $45 remaining.\n\nSo, they have $45 left to spend after meeting all the minimum requirements. Now, the question is, how can they optimize their spending? I think this means they should allocate the remaining money in a way that gives them the most value, probably by buying more of the cheaper items.\n\nLooking at the costs:\n\n- Bookshelves are $75 each.\n- Books are $15 each.\n- Beanbags are $40 each.\n\nBooks are the cheapest, followed by beanbags, and then shelves. So, to maximize the number of additional items, they should spend the remaining $45 on the cheapest option first, which is children's books.\n\nEach book costs $15, so let's see how many they can buy with $45.\n\n$45 \u00f7 $15 per book = 3 books.\n\nSo, they can buy 3 additional books.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. If they buy 3 books, that would add to their initial 10, making it 13 books. That seems reasonable.\n\nAlternatively, they could also consider buying one beanbag chair with $40 and then have $5 left, which doesn't buy anything else. Or maybe buying another shelf and have negative money, which isn't possible. So, buying books is better.\n\nAlternatively, if they don't buy all the minimum required items, but I think the problem states they need at least 3 shelves, 10 books, and 2 chairs. So, they can't go below that.\n\nSo, the optimal spending would be:\n\n- 3 shelves: $225\n- 10 books: $150\n- 2 chairs: $80\n- 3 additional books: $45\n\nTotal spent: $225 + $150 + $80 + $45 = $500 exactly.\n\nThat's perfect because they're using up the entire budget without going over. So, they meet all the minimum requirements and have $45 left, which they've used to buy 3 more books.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of additional books they can purchase is 3.\n\nWait, but let me make sure there's no other combination that allows them to buy more books or maybe more beanbags or shelves without exceeding the budget.\n\nSuppose they buy 3 shelves, 10 books, and 2 chairs, that's $455. Then with $45, they can buy 3 books. Alternatively, if they reduce the number of shelves or chairs, but the problem says they need at least 3 shelves, 10 books, and 2 chairs. So, they can't reduce below those numbers.\n\nAnother option: instead of buying 3 shelves, maybe buy 2 shelves and see if they can buy more books or chairs. Let's try that.\n\nIf they buy 2 shelves: 2\u00d7$75 = $150.\n\nThen, 10 books: $150.\n\n2 chairs: $80.\n\nTotal so far: $150 + $150 + $80 = $380.\n\nRemaining budget: $500 - $380 = $120.\n\nNow, with $120, they can buy more books or chairs or shelves.\n\nBooks are cheaper, so let's see how many books they can buy with $120.\n\n$120 \u00f7 $15 = 8 books.\n\nSo, they can buy 8 additional books, making the total books 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nBut wait, they initially only needed 10, so they can have 18.\n\nAlternatively, they could buy more chairs or shelves.\n\nLet me see:\n\nIf they buy 2 shelves, 10 books, and 2 chairs, that's $380. Then, with $120, they can buy more chairs or books.\n\nEach chair is $40, so 120 \u00f7 40 = 3 chairs. So, they can buy 3 chairs, making it 2 + 3 = 5 chairs, but they only needed 2. So, that's an option.\n\nAlternatively, they can buy more shelves: 120 \u00f7 75 = 1.6, which isn't a whole number, so they can't buy another shelf without exceeding the budget.\n\nSo, buying 2 shelves, 10 books, 2 chairs, and 8 books would total:\n\nShelves: 2\u00d775=150\n\nBooks: 10 +8=18\u00d715=270\n\nChairs: 2\u00d740=80\n\nTotal: 150 +270 +80=500.\n\nThat works too. So, they could have 18 books instead of 13. So, which is better? 13 or 18 books? 18 is more, so that's better.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"at least\" 10 books, so 18 is acceptable.\n\nSo, in this case, buying 2 shelves, 10 books, 2 chairs, and 8 additional books would use up the entire $500, resulting in 18 books.\n\nAlternatively, if they buy 3 shelves, 10 books, 2 chairs, and 3 additional books, that's 13 books.\n\nSo, 18 is more, so that's better.\n\nBut is that allowed? Let me check.\n\nThey need at least 3 shelves, so 2 is less than 3, which is not allowed. So, they must have at least 3 shelves. So, buying 2 shelves is not acceptable because they need at least 3.\n\nTherefore, the previous approach where they bought 3 shelves, 10 books, 2 chairs, and 3 additional books is the correct one because it meets all the minimum requirements.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of additional books they can buy is 3.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any other combination.\n\nSuppose they buy 3 shelves, 10 books, 2 chairs, and 3 books: total $500.\n\nAlternatively, if they buy 3 shelves, 10 books, 2 chairs, and 3 books, that's 3+3=6 additional books? Wait, no, 3 shelves, 10 books, 2 chairs, and 3 additional books: total books 13.\n\nAlternatively, if they buy 3 shelves, 10 books, 2 chairs, and then use the remaining $45 to buy more books, which is 3 books, making it 13 books.\n\nAlternatively, if they buy 3 shelves, 10 books, 2 chairs, and then see if they can buy more books: 3 shelves is $225, 10 books $150, 2 chairs $80. Total so far: 225+150+80=455. Remaining: 45. So, 45/15=3 books. So, 13 books total.\n\nAlternatively, if they buy 3 shelves, 10 books, and 2 chairs, that's $455, then with $45, they can't buy another shelf because 45<75, nor another chair because 45<40? Wait, 40 is less than 45, so they could buy one more chair and have $5 left, but that would exceed the budget if they have to have at least 2 chairs.\n\nWait, no, they need at least 2 chairs, so buying one more is allowed. Let's see:\n\nIf they buy 3 shelves: $225\n\n10 books: $150\n\n3 chairs: 3\u00d740=120\n\nTotal: 225+150+120=495.\n\nWait, that's $495, leaving $5. But 5 isn't enough to buy another book or a shelf or another chair.\n\nBut they could have bought 3 chairs instead of 2, making it 3 chairs, which is more than the minimum 2. So, that's allowed.\n\nIn that case, they have $5 left, which isn't enough for another book or anything else.\n\nSo, in this case, they have 10 books, 3 chairs, and 3 shelves.\n\nBut is that better? Because they have more chairs but fewer books.\n\nAlternatively, they could buy 3 shelves, 10 books, 2 chairs, and 3 books, making 13 books.\n\nSo, which is better? More books or more chairs?\n\nSince the question is about maximizing the number of books, buying more books is better.\n\nTherefore, the optimal allocation is to buy 3 shelves, 10 books, 2 chairs, and 3 additional books, totaling 13 books.\n\nThis uses up all $500, so they can't spend more.\n\nAlternatively, if they buy 3 shelves, 10 books, 2 chairs, and 3 books, that's 13 books.\n\nAlternatively, if they buy 3 shelves, 10 books, 2 chairs, and 3 books, that's 13 books.\n\nAlternatively, if they buy 3 shelves, 10 books, 2 chairs, and 3 books, that's 13 books.\n\nSo, in all cases, they can have 13 books, 3 shelves, 2 chairs, and the budget is fully used.\n\nAlternatively, if they buy 3 shelves, 10 books, 2 chairs, and 3 books, that's 13 books.\n\nAlternatively, they could buy more chairs if they have extra money, but in this case, they have exactly $500, so they can't.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of additional books they can buy is 3.\n\nSo, the answer is 3 additional books.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any other combination.\n\nSuppose they buy 3 shelves, 10 books, 2 chairs, and 3 books: total $500.\n\nAlternatively, if they buy 3 shelves, 10 books, 2 chairs, and 3 books: total $500.\n\nAlternatively, if they buy 3 shelves, 10 books, 2 chairs, and 3 books: total $500.\n\nAlternatively, if they buy 3 shelves, 10 books, 2 chairs, and 3 books: total $500.\n\nSo, regardless, they can only buy 3 additional books.\n\nAlternatively, if they reduce the number of shelves, but they can't because they need at least 3.\n\nAlternatively, if they buy 3 shelves, 10 books, 2 chairs, and 3 books: total $500.\n\nSo, I think 3 is the maximum number of additional books they can buy.\n\nTherefore, the library can purchase 3 additional books with the remaining $45, making the total books 13, while meeting all the minimum requirements.\n</think>\n\nThe library can allocate their $500 budget to purchase 3 bookshelves, 13 children's books, and 2 beanbag chairs, using up the entire budget. This allows them to meet all their requirements while maximizing the number of additional books they can buy, which is 3.\n\n**Answer:** The library can purchase 3 additional books, resulting in a total of 13 children's books. They can also buy 3 bookshelves, 2 beanbag chairs, and use the entire $500 budget. DONE."

End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: A small community library has received a donation of $500 to improve their children's section. They need to purchase new bookshelves, children's books, and some comfortable seating. After researching options, they found that each bookshelf costs $75, each children's book costs $15, and each small beanbag chair costs $40. The library director has determined they need at least 3 bookshelves to organize the current collection, at least 10 new books to expand offerings, and at least 2 beanbag chairs for the children to sit on while reading. How can the library optimize their spending to meet all these minimum requirements while staying within their $500 budget? What's the maximum number of additional books they could purchase with any remaining funds? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so the library has this $500 donation, and they need to spend it wisely on bookshelves, children's books, and beanbag chairs. Let me break down what they need and how they can allocate the funds.\n\nFirst off, the minimum requirements are:\n- **3 bookshelves**: Each costs $75, so that's 3 times 75.\n- **10 children's books**: Each is $15, so that's 10 times 15.\n- **2 beanbag chairs**: Each is $40, so that's 2 times 40.\n\nLet me calculate the total minimum cost for these.\n\n**Bookshelves**: 3 * $75 = $225  \n**Books**: 10 * $15 = $150  \n**Beanbags**: 2 * $40 = $80  \n\nAdding those up: $225 + $150 = $375, plus $80 is $455. Hmm, so the minimum expenditure for the required items is $455.\n\nNow, the library has a total of $500. So, the remaining money they can use for additional books or other items is $500 - $455 = $45.\n\nThe question is, how can they maximize the number of additional books? Since each book costs $15, I should see how many can be bought with the remaining $45.\n\n$45 divided by $15 is 3. So, they can buy 3 additional books.\n\nWait, let me double-check. If they buy 3 more books, that's 10 + 3 = 13 books. The cost breakdown would be:\n- 3 bookshelves: $225\n- 13 books: 13 * $15 = $195\n- 2 beanbags: $80\n\nTotal: $225 + $195 = $420, plus $80 is $500. Perfect, that fits within the budget.\n\nSo, the maximum number of additional books they can purchase is 3.\n</think>\n\nThe library can purchase 3 additional books, bringing the total number of books to 13.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Calculate the cost of minimum required items:**\n   - 3 bookshelves at $75 each: 3 \u00d7 75 = $225\n   - 10 children's books at $15 each: 10 \u00d7 15 = $150\n   - 2 beanbag chairs at $40 each: 2 \u00d7 40 = $80\n   - Total: $225 + $150 + $80 = $455\n\n2. **Determine remaining budget:**\n   - Total donation: $500\n   - Used for minimum items: $455\n   - Remaining: $500 - $455 = $45\n\n3. **Calculate additional books possible with remaining money:**\n   - Each additional book costs $15.\n   - Number of additional books: $45 \u00f7 15 = 3\n\n4. **Total books purchased:**\n   - 10 + 3 = 13 books\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe library can purchase 3 additional books, totaling 13 books. The maximum number of additional books they can buy is 3.\n\nDONE."

The library director has determined they need at least 3 bookshelves to organize the current collection, at least 10 new books to expand offerings, and at least 2 beanbag chairs for the children to sit on while reading. How can the library optimize their spending to meet all these minimum requirements while staying within their $500 budget? What's the maximum number of additional books they could purchase with any remaining funds? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I need to help this small community library optimize their spending to meet all the minimum requirements and stay within the $500 budget. Then, figure out the maximum number of additional books they could buy with any remaining funds. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's list out the requirements and their costs:\n\n1. **Bookshelves:** They need at least 3. Each bookshelf costs $75.\n2. **Children's books:** They need at least 10 new books. Each book costs $15.\n3. **Beanbag chairs:** They need at least 2. Each chair costs $40.\n\nSo, let's calculate the total minimum cost for these items first.\n\nCalculating the cost for bookshelves:\n3 bookshelves * $75/bookshelf = $225\n\nCalculating the cost for children's books:\n10 books * $15/book = $150\n\nCalculating the cost for beanbag chairs:\n2 chairs * $40/chair = $80\n\nNow, let's add these up to see how much money is spent on the minimum requirements:\n$225 (bookshelves) + $150 (books) + $80 (beanbags) = $455\n\nHmm, so the minimum expenditure for these three items is $455. The library has a total budget of $500, so there's some leftover money to use for additional books or maybe even more beanbags or shelves if needed. But the question is about maximizing the number of additional books, so I should focus on that.\n\nThe leftover money would be:\n$500 (total budget) - $455 (minimum requirements) = $45\n\nSo, with $45 remaining, how many additional books can they purchase? Each book is $15, so:\n$45 / $15/book = 3 additional books\n\nTherefore, the library could purchase 3 more books beyond the initial 10, making the total books 13.\n\nWait, let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nBookshelves: 3 * 75 = 225 \u2714\ufe0f\nBooks: 10 + 3 = 13, each at 15, so 13*15 = 195 \u2714\ufe0f\nBeanbags: 2*40 = 80 \u2714\ufe0f\nTotal: 225 + 195 + 80 = 500 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nEverything adds up correctly. So, the maximum number of additional books they can buy is 3.\n</think>\n\nThe library can purchase the minimum required items and use the remaining $45 to buy 3 additional books. \n\n**Final Answer:** They can purchase 3 additional books, making the total number of books 13.

What's the maximum number of additional books they could purchase with any remaining funds? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I need to help this small community library optimize their spending to meet all their minimum requirements while staying within a $500 budget. They received a donation of $500, and they need to buy bookshelves, children's books, and beanbag chairs. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let me list out what they need:\n\n1. **Bookshelves**: They need at least 3.\n2. **Children's Books**: At least 10 new ones.\n3. **Beanbag Chairs**: At least 2.\n\nEach bookshelf costs $75, each book costs $15, and each beanbag chair is $40. The total budget is $500.\n\nI think the first thing to do is calculate how much it would cost to meet all the minimum requirements. Then, see if there's any money left over after that, which can be used to buy additional books.\n\nSo, let's calculate the cost for the minimum items:\n\n- **Bookshelves**: 3 * $75 = $225\n- **Children's Books**: 10 * $15 = $150\n- **Beanbag Chairs**: 2 * $40 = $80\n\nNow, add these up: $225 + $150 + $80 = $455\n\nHmm, $455 is less than $500. That means there's $500 - $455 = $45 left. \n\nBut the question is about optimizing spending. So, maybe they can buy more of some items and less of others to stay within the budget while still meeting the minimum requirements.\n\nWait, but the minimum requirements are fixed. They need at least 3 bookshelves, 10 books, and 2 beanbags. So, they can't go below those numbers. Therefore, they have to buy exactly 3 bookshelves, 10 books, and 2 beanbags to meet the minimums. Any extra money would be used to buy more of any of these items or perhaps additional books.\n\nBut the question is asking for the maximum number of additional books they could purchase with any remaining funds. So, after meeting the minimums, any extra money should be used to buy more books since each book is relatively cheaper compared to beanbags and bookshelves.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If they have $45 left, and each book is $15, then 45 / 15 = 3. So, they can buy 3 additional books.\n\nBut wait, maybe they can use some of that money to buy beanbags or bookshelves, freeing up more money for books? Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe buying more beanbags or bookshelves could allow them to buy more books because they might be able to reduce the number of beanbags or bookshelves, but no, the minimums are fixed. They need at least 3 bookshelves, 10 books, and 2 beanbags. So, they can't go below those numbers. Therefore, any extra money must be used to buy additional books or maybe a combination of more beanbags or bookshelves and more books.\n\nBut since the goal is to maximize the number of additional books, it's better to spend the extra money only on books.\n\nSo, with $45 left, they can buy 3 more books. So, total books would be 13.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculations.\n\nTotal cost for minimums:\n\n3 bookshelves: 3 * 75 = 225\n\n10 books: 10 * 15 = 150\n\n2 beanbags: 2 * 40 = 80\n\nTotal: 225 + 150 + 80 = 455\n\nRemaining: 500 - 455 = 45\n\n45 / 15 = 3, so 3 more books.\n\nSo, total books: 13.\n\nAlternatively, if they use the remaining money for beanbags or bookshelves, they might have more money for books. Wait, no, because they have to buy at least 3 bookshelves, 10 books, and 2 beanbags. So, they can't reduce the number of bookshelves or beanbags. Therefore, the extra money is only $45, which can be used to buy 3 additional books.\n\nBut let me think again. Suppose they buy more beanbags instead of books. For example, if they buy 3 beanbags instead of 2, that would cost 3 * 40 = 120, which would leave them with 45 - 120 = negative, which isn't possible. So, that's not an option.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they can buy more bookshelves. Each additional bookshelf costs 75. If they buy one more, that would be 4 bookshelves, costing 300. But they only have 45 left, so they can't do that.\n\nTherefore, the only option is to buy 3 additional books.\n\nWait, but the question is about the maximum number of additional books, so 3.\n\nBut let me think again: is there a way to buy more books by reducing the number of beanbags? For example, if they buy 1 beanbag instead of 2, that would save 40, which could be used to buy more books. Then, the remaining money would be 45 + 40 = 85, which would allow them to buy 85 / 15 \u2248 5.666, so 5 more books. But wait, the problem says they need at least 2 beanbags. So, they can't go below 2. Therefore, they have to buy 2 beanbags at minimum.\n\nSimilarly, they can't reduce the number of bookshelves below 3.\n\nSo, they have to buy exactly 3 bookshelves, 10 books, and 2 beanbags, costing 455, leaving 45, which can buy 3 more books.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of additional books is 3.\n\nWait, but let me check again:\n\nTotal cost with 3 bookshelves, 10 books, and 2 beanbags: 225 + 150 + 80 = 455\n\nRemaining: 45\n\n45 / 15 = 3\n\nSo, 3 more books.\n\nAlternatively, if they buy more beanbags, say 3, that would cost 120, but they only have 45 left, so that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, buying more bookshelves: 4 bookshelves would cost 300, which is more than 45, so no.\n\nTherefore, the only way is to buy 3 more books.\n\nBut wait, the question says \"at least\" 3 bookshelves, 10 books, and 2 beanbags. So, maybe they can buy more than the minimum and have more money left for books. Let's explore that.\n\nSuppose they buy 4 bookshelves, 10 books, and 2 beanbags.\n\nCost: 4*75=300, 10*15=150, 2*40=80. Total: 300+150+80=530, which is over the budget. So, no.\n\nAlternatively, buy 3 bookshelves, 11 books, and 2 beanbags.\n\nCost: 3*75=225, 11*15=165, 2*40=80. Total: 225+165+80=470. Remaining: 30.\n\n30 /15=2, so 2 more books. So total books:13.\n\nWait, but that's less than the previous scenario where they bought 3 more books.\n\nAlternatively, buy 3 bookshelves, 10 books, and 3 beanbags.\n\nCost: 225 + 150 + 120=495. Remaining:5. Can't buy any more books.\n\nSo, that's worse.\n\nAlternatively, buy 3 bookshelves, 10 books, and 2 beanbags, and then use the remaining 45 to buy 3 more books.\n\nSo, total books:13.\n\nAlternatively, if they buy 3 bookshelves, 10 books, and 2 beanbags, and then use the remaining 45 to buy 3 more books, that's 13 books.\n\nAlternatively, if they buy 3 bookshelves, 10 books, 2 beanbags, and 3 more books, total books 13.\n\nBut wait, is there a way to have more than 3 additional books? Let me see.\n\nIf they buy more beanbags, but that would require more money.\n\nWait, maybe they can buy more beanbags and still have money for books.\n\nBut let's see:\n\nSuppose they buy 3 bookshelves, 10 books, 3 beanbags.\n\nCost: 225 + 150 + 120=495. Remaining:5. Can't buy more books.\n\nAlternatively, buy 3 bookshelves, 10 books, 2 beanbags, and 3 books: 225+150+80+45=500. So, exactly $500.\n\nSo, that's the maximum.\n\nAlternatively, if they buy 3 bookshelves, 10 books, 2 beanbags, and 3 books, total books 13.\n\nAlternatively, could they buy 3 bookshelves, 11 books, and 2 beanbags, and have $30 left, which can buy 2 more books. So, total books 13.\n\nWait, same as before.\n\nAlternatively, buy 3 bookshelves, 10 books, 2 beanbags, and 3 books: 13 books.\n\nAlternatively, buy 3 bookshelves, 10 books, 2 beanbags, and 3 books: 13 books.\n\nSo, in all cases, the maximum number of additional books is 3.\n\nWait, but let me think again: is there a way to spend the $45 more efficiently to get more books? For example, if they buy more beanbags, but that would cost more, so it's not efficient.\n\nAlternatively, buy more bookshelves, but that would also cost more.\n\nTherefore, the best way is to spend all the remaining $45 on books, buying 3 more.\n\nSo, the maximum number of additional books is 3.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm:\n\nTotal books:10 +3=13\n\nTotal cost:225 + (10+3)*15 +80=225+195+80=500\n\nYes, that adds up.\n\nAlternatively, could they buy 3 bookshelves, 11 books, and 2 beanbags, and have $30 left, which buys 2 more books. So total books 13.\n\nSame as before.\n\nSo, either way, they can have 13 books.\n\nWait, but the question is about the maximum number of additional books, so 3.\n\nAlternatively, if they buy 3 bookshelves, 10 books, 2 beanbags, and 3 books, that's 13 books.\n\nAlternatively, if they buy 3 bookshelves, 10 books, 2 beanbags, and 3 books, that's 13.\n\nSo, 3 additional books.\n\nWait, but the question says \"the maximum number of additional books they could purchase with any remaining funds.\"\n\nSo, the answer is 3.\n\nBut let me see if there's another way.\n\nSuppose they buy 3 bookshelves, 10 books, 2 beanbags: total 455.\n\nRemaining:45.\n\n45/15=3.\n\nSo, 3 more books.\n\nAlternatively, if they buy 3 bookshelves, 10 books, 2 beanbags, and 3 books, total 13 books.\n\nAlternatively, if they buy 3 bookshelves, 10 books, 2 beanbags, and 3 books, that's 13 books.\n\nSo, yes, 3 additional books.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of additional books is 3.\n</think>\n\nTo optimize the library's spending, they must purchase the minimum required items and use any remaining funds for additional books. \n\n- **Minimum Purchases**:\n  - 3 bookshelves: 3 \u00d7 $75 = $225\n  - 10 children's books: 10 \u00d7 $15 = $150\n  - 2 beanbag chairs: 2 \u00d7 $40 = $80\n  - **Total Cost**: $225 + $150 + $80 = $455\n\n- **Remaining Funds**: $500 - $455 = $45\n\n- **Additional Books**: $45 / $15 = 3\n\n**Final Purchases**:\n- 3 bookshelves\n- 13 children's books (10 + 3)\n- 2 beanbag chairs\n\n**Maximum Additional Books**: 3\n\nDONE."
