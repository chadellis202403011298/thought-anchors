  "question": "A small community library has received a donation of $500 to improve their children's section. They need to purchase new bookshelves, children's books, and some comfortable seating. After researching options, they found that each bookshelf costs $75, each children's book costs $15, and each small beanbag chair costs $40. The library director has determined they need at least 3 bookshelves to organize the current collection, at least 10 new books to expand offerings, and at least 2 beanbag chairs for the children to sit on while reading. How can the library optimize their spending to meet all these minimum requirements while staying within their $500 budget? What's the maximum number of additional books they could purchase with any remaining funds?",
  "answer": "Let's solve this step by step:\n\n1) First, identify the minimum requirements and their costs:\n   - At least 3 bookshelves at $75 each = $225\n   - At least 10 books at $15 each = $150\n   - At least 2 beanbag chairs at $40 each = $80\n   - Total minimum cost: $225 + $150 + $80 = $455\n\n2) Calculate the remaining budget after meeting minimum requirements:\n   - Budget: $500\n   - Minimum expenses: $455\n   - Remaining funds: $500 - $455 = $45\n\n3) Determine how to use the remaining $45:\n   - Since each additional book costs $15, and $45 \u00f7 $15 = 3, the library can purchase 3 additional books with the remaining funds.\n\n4) Final allocation:\n   - 3 bookshelves ($225)\n   - 13 books (10 minimum + 3 additional = $195)\n   - 2 beanbag chairs ($80)\n   - Total spent: $225 + $195 + $80 = $500\n\nTherefore, the library can meet all minimum requirements and purchase a maximum of 3 additional books (for a total of 13 books) while staying within their $500 budget."
