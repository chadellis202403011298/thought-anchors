  "question": "Consider the following 3\u00d73 matrix pattern:\n\n2  5  10\n4  7  12\n8  11 ?\n\nWhat number should replace the question mark to continue the pattern?",
  "answer": "The pattern in this matrix can be understood by examining the differences between adjacent numbers.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the rows:\nRow 1: 2, 5, 10 (differences: +3, +5)\nRow 2: 4, 7, 12 (differences: +3, +5)\nRow 3: 8, 11, ? (differences: +3, ?)\n\nWe can see that in each row, the difference between the first and second numbers is consistently +3, and the difference between the second and third numbers appears to be consistently +5.\n\nTherefore, the missing number should be 11 + 5 = 16.\n\nWe can verify this by checking for other patterns:\nColumn 1: 2, 4, 8 (differences: +2, +4)\nColumn 2: 5, 7, 11 (differences: +2, +4)\nColumn 3: 10, 12, ? (differences: +2, ?)\n\nIn the columns, the difference between the first and second numbers is consistently +2, and the difference between the second and third numbers is consistently +4.\n\nSo if we apply this pattern to the third column, we get 12 + 4 = 16.\n\nBoth approaches yield the same answer: 16."
