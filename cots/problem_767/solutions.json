The differences between consecutive numbers are 2 and 4, which suggests a doubling pattern: 2 \u00d7 2 = 4, and 4 \u00d7 2 = 8.\n\nIn the second column, the numbers are 5, 7, and 11. The differences are 2 and 4 again, following the same doubling pattern: 5 \u00d7 2 = 10, but since 10 is already in the matrix, I'll move to the next difference.\n\nIn the third column, the numbers are 10, 12, and ?. The differences are 2 and 4, so I'll apply the same pattern to find the missing number: 12 \u00d7 2 = 24.\n\nFinally, I'll verify the pattern by checking if the third column follows the same doubling pattern as the other columns.\n</think>\n\nTo find the missing number in the 3\u00d73 matrix pattern:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}\n\\hline\n2 & 5 & 10 \\\\\n\\hline\n4 & 7 & 12 \\\\\n\\hline\n8 & 11 & ? \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Pattern in Columns**\n\nLet's examine each column to identify the pattern:\n\n1. **First Column (2, 4, 8):**\n   - Difference between 2 and 4: \\(4 - 2 = 2\\)\n   - Difference between 4 and 8: \\(8 - 4 = 4\\)\n   - **Pattern:** The difference doubles each time.\n\n2. **Second Column (5, 7, 11):**\n   - Difference between 5 and 7: \\(7 - 5 = 2\\)\n   - Difference between 7 and 11: \\(11 - 7 = 4\\)\n   - **Pattern:** Similar to the first column, the difference doubles each time.\n\n3. **Third Column (10, 12, ?):**\n   - Difference between 10 and 12: \\(12 - 10 = 2\\)\n   - Difference between 12 and ? should be **4** to follow the pattern.\n   - **Missing Number:** \\(12 + 4 = 16\\)\n\n**Step 2: Verify the Pattern Consistently**\n\n- **First Column:** \\(2 \\times 2 = 4\\), \\(4 \\times 2 = 8\\)\n- **Second Column:** \\(5 \\times 2 = 10\\), \\(7 \\times 2 = 14\\) (but 14 isn't in the matrix; however, the difference pattern holds)\n- **Third Column:** \\(10 \\times 2 = 20\\) (but 20 isn't in the matrix; instead, the difference pattern is applied)\n\nIt appears that the pattern focuses on the differences rather than the multiplication.

End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: Consider the following 3\u00d73 matrix pattern:\n\n2  5  10\n4  7  12\n8  11 ?\n\nWhat number should replace the question mark to continue the pattern? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this 3x3 matrix pattern here, and I need to figure out what number should replace the question mark. Let me take a look at the matrix again:\n\n2  5  10\n4  7  12\n8  11 ?\n\nHmm, okay. I need to find the number in the bottom right corner. Let me see if there's a pattern in the numbers provided. Maybe it's an arithmetic or geometric sequence, or perhaps there's some relationship between the numbers.\n\nFirst, I'll write down the numbers in order as they appear in the matrix:\n\n2, 5, 10,\n4, 7, 12,\n8, 11, ?\n\nLet me see if there's a pattern in the rows or columns. Maybe each row has a certain relationship, or each column does. Let's look at the first row: 2, 5, 10. Hmm, from 2 to 5 is an increase of 3, and from 5 to 10 is an increase of 5. That doesn't seem to follow a simple arithmetic sequence, but maybe it's a geometric one. Let's check: 2 times something equals 5. That would be 2.5, which isn't an integer, so probably not geometric.\n\nWhat about columns? Let's check the first column: 2, 4, 8. Okay, 2 to 4 is +2, and 4 to 8 is +4. That's an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 2 and then 4. Hmm, maybe each column has a different pattern. Let's check the second column: 5, 7, 11. From 5 to 7 is +2, and from 7 to 11 is +4. Oh, that's the same as the first column. Interesting. Now the third column: 10, 12, ?. From 10 to 12 is +2, so maybe the next number is 14? But let's not jump to conclusions yet.\n\nWait, maybe there's a diagonal pattern. Let me check the main diagonal: 2, 7, ?. From 2 to 7 is +5, so maybe the next number is 12? But the main diagonal would be 2, 7, ?, but the third diagonal element is 12 as given. Hmm, that doesn't quite fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the differences between the numbers can help. Let's list the differences between consecutive numbers in each row and column.\n\nLooking at the first row: 2, 5, 10. The differences are 3 and 5.\n\nSecond row: 4, 7, 12. The differences are 3 and 5 as well.\n\nThird row: 8, 11, ?. The differences are 3 and something. So from 8 to 11 is +3, and from 11 to ? would also need to be + something. Let's see if the pattern holds.\n\nLooking at the columns:\n\nFirst column: 2,4,8. Differences are +2, +4.\n\nSecond column:5,7,11. Differences are +2, +4.\n\nThird column:10,12,?. Differences are +2, and then ?.\n\nSo in the third column, the difference between 10 and 12 is +2, so if the pattern continues, the next number should be 14. So 10 +2=12, 12+2=14. Therefore, the number should be 14.\n\nBut wait, let me check the rows again. In the third row, from 8 to 11 is +3, so if the pattern in the rows is +3, then from 11 to ? would be +5, making it 16. But that's conflicting with the column pattern which suggests +2.\n\nHmm, so there's a conflict here. The third column suggests +2, but the third row suggests +5. That's a problem. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is based on the sum of the previous two numbers or something else. Let me think differently.\n\nLooking at the numbers:\n\n2,5,10,4,7,12,8,11,?\n\nMaybe it's a sequence where each number is the sum of the two numbers above it. Let's check:\n\nLooking at the third column, 10 is below 2 and 5. 2+5=7, but that's not 10. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each number is the sum of the number to the left and the number above. Let's try that.\n\nFor the third column:\n\n10 is in the first row, third column. To the left is 5, above is nothing (since it's the top row). So maybe 5 + something? Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe it's a magic square? In a magic square, the sums of the rows, columns, and diagonals are equal. Let's check that.\n\nThe magic constant for a 3x3 magic square is 15. Let's see:\n\nFirst row: 2+5+10=17. That's not 15. So it's not a magic square.\n\nHmm, maybe it's based on some other pattern, like the position of the numbers. Let me see the positions:\n\n(1,1)=2, (1,2)=5, (1,3)=10\n\n(2,1)=4, (2,2)=7, (2,3)=12\n\n(3,1)=8, (3,2)=11, (3,3)=?\n\nLooking at the numbers, maybe they are following a pattern where each number is the previous number plus an incrementing value.\n\nLooking at the first row: 2,5,10.\n\nFrom 2 to 5: +3\n\nFrom 5 to 10: +5\n\nSo the increments are +3, +5.\n\nIn the second row:4,7,12.\n\nFrom 4 to7: +3\n\nFrom7 to12:+5\n\nSame as first row.\n\nThird row:8,11,?\n\nFrom8 to11:+3\n\nFrom11 to ?: +5, so 11+5=16.\n\nBut let's check the columns:\n\nFirst column:2,4,8\n\nFrom2 to4:+2\n\nFrom4 to8:+4\n\nSo increments are +2, +4.\n\nSecond column:5,7,11\n\nFrom5 to7:+2\n\nFrom7 to11:+4\n\nSame as first column.\n\nThird column:10,12,?\n\nFrom10 to12:+2\n\nFrom12 to ?: +4, so 12+4=16.\n\nWait, but earlier in the rows, the third column would be 10,12,16, but in the third row, it's 8,11,?.\n\nFrom8 to11:+3, so 11+5=16.\n\nSo both the row and column patterns point to 16 in the bottom right corner.\n\nBut earlier I thought the third column would be 14, but that was based on a different increment pattern.\n\nWait, let's clarify.\n\nIn the third column, the differences are:\n\n10 to12: +2\n\n12 to ?: ?\n\nIf the column pattern is +2, +4, then the next difference should be +4, making it 12+4=16.\n\nSimilarly, in the third row, the differences are +3, +5, so 8 to11:+3, 11 to ?:+5, so 16.\n\nSo both the row and column patterns lead to 16.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the third column might be +2, +2, but that doesn't fit the column pattern. The column pattern is +2, +4, so the third column should be 10,12,16.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the number should be 16.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the third column was +2, but that was a mistake. Let me correct that.\n\nIn the third column:\n\n10 (row1) to12 (row2): +2\n\n12 (row2) to ? (row3): +4 (since the column pattern is +2, +4)\n\nSo 12+4=16.\n\nSimilarly, in the third row:\n\n8 (row3, column1) to11 (row3, column2): +3\n\n11 (row3, column2) to ? (row3, column3): +5\n\nSo 11+5=16.\n\nTherefore, the number should be 16.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 14, but that was a mistake. Let me make sure.\n\nYes, because the column pattern is +2, +4, so from 12, adding 4 gives 16.\n\nSo the answer is 16.\n</think>\n\nThe number that should replace the question mark is found by analyzing the column and row patterns. Each column and row follows an increment pattern where the differences increase by 2 each time. The third column increases by +2 and then +4, leading to 16. Similarly, the third row increases by +3 and then +5, also leading to 16. \n\nDONE."
