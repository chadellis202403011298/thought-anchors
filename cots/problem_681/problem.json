  "question": "In a survey of 120 college students, the following information was gathered:\n- 75 students enjoy reading fiction\n- 65 students enjoy reading non-fiction\n- 40 students enjoy reading both fiction and non-fiction\n\nBased on this information, answer the following questions:\n1. How many students enjoy reading fiction but not non-fiction?\n2. How many students enjoy reading non-fiction but not fiction?\n3. How many students don't enjoy reading either type of book?",
  "answer": "This problem can be solved by setting up a Venn diagram with two overlapping circles - one for fiction readers and one for non-fiction readers.\n\nGiven information:\n- Total number of students: 120\n- Students who enjoy reading fiction: 75\n- Students who enjoy reading non-fiction: 65\n- Students who enjoy reading both: 40\n\nStep 1: Calculate the number of students who enjoy reading fiction but not non-fiction.\nStudents who enjoy fiction only = Total fiction readers - Those who enjoy both\n= 75 - 40 = 35 students\n\nStep 2: Calculate the number of students who enjoy reading non-fiction but not fiction.\nStudents who enjoy non-fiction only = Total non-fiction readers - Those who enjoy both\n= 65 - 40 = 25 students\n\nStep 3: Calculate the number of students who don't enjoy reading either type.\nFirst, determine how many students enjoy at least one type of reading:\nStudents who enjoy at least one type = Fiction only + Non-fiction only + Both\n= 35 + 25 + 40 = 100 students\n\nTherefore, students who don't enjoy either type = Total students - Students who enjoy at least one type\n= 120 - 100 = 20 students\n\nAnswers:\n1. 35 students enjoy reading fiction but not non-fiction\n2. 25 students enjoy reading non-fiction but not fiction\n3. 20 students don't enjoy reading either type of book"
