How many students enjoy reading fiction but not non-fiction?\n2. How many students enjoy reading non-fiction but not fiction?\n3. How many students don't enjoy reading either type of book? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I've got this survey data about college students and their reading habits. There are 120 students in total. The data shows that 75 enjoy reading fiction, 65 enjoy reading non-fiction, and 40 enjoy both. I need to figure out three things: how many enjoy only fiction, how many enjoy only non-fiction, and how many don't enjoy either.\n\nFirst, I think I should visualize this with a Venn diagram. There are two circles: one for fiction and one for non-fiction. The overlap between them is the 40 students who enjoy both. So, the total number of students is 120, which is the sum of those who enjoy only fiction, only non-fiction, both, and neither.\n\nLet me denote the number of students who enjoy only fiction as F, and those who enjoy only non-fiction as N. So, according to the problem:\n\nF + N + Both + Neither = Total\n\nI know Both is 40, and Total is 120. So,\n\nF + N + 40 + Neither = 120\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nF + N + Neither = 80\n\nNow, I need to find F and N separately. I have the total number of students who enjoy fiction, which is 75. That includes those who enjoy only fiction and those who enjoy both. So,\n\nF + Both = 75\n\nWe know Both is 40, so:\n\nF = 75 - 40 = 35\n\nSo, 35 students enjoy only fiction.\n\nSimilarly, for non-fiction, the total is 65, which includes those who enjoy only non-fiction and both. So,\n\nN + Both = 65\n\nAgain, Both is 40, so:\n\nN = 65 - 40 = 25\n\nSo, 25 students enjoy only non-fiction.\n\nNow, going back to the equation F + N + Neither = 80, we can plug in the values:\n\n35 + 25 + Neither = 80\n\nSo,\n\n60 + Neither = 80\n\nTherefore,\n\nNeither = 80 - 60 = 20\n\nSo, 20 students don't enjoy reading either type of book.\n</think>\n\nTo solve this problem, we'll use the principle of inclusion-exclusion and set theory to find the number of students who enjoy each category of reading.\n\n**Given:**\n- Total number of students surveyed: 120\n- Number of students who enjoy reading fiction (F): 75\n- Number of students who enjoy reading non-fiction (N): 65\n- Number of students who enjoy both fiction and non-fiction (F \u2229 N): 40\n\n**To Find:**\n1. Number of students who enjoy reading fiction but not non-fiction (F - N).\n2. Number of students who enjoy reading non-fiction but not fiction (N - F).\n3. Number of students who do not enjoy reading either type of book (Neither).\n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. **Students who enjoy only fiction (F - N):**\n   - We know that F = 75 and F \u2229 N = 40.\n   - Therefore, students who enjoy only fiction = F - (F \u2229 N) = 75 - 40 = 35.\n\n2. **Students who enjoy only non-fiction (N - F):**\n   - We know that N = 65 and F \u2229 N = 40.\n   - Therefore, students who enjoy only non-fiction = N - (F \u2229 N) = 65 - 40 = 25.\n\n3. **Students who do not enjoy reading either type of book:**\n   - Total students surveyed = F + N - (F \u2229 N) + Neither.\n   - Plugging in the values: 120 = 75 + 65 - 40 + Neither.\n   - Simplifying: 120 = 100 - 40 + Neither \u2192 120 = 60 + Neither \u2192 Neither = 120 - 60 = 20.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n1. **35** students enjoy reading fiction but not non-fiction.\n2. **25** students enjoy reading non-fiction but not fiction.\n3. **20** students do not enjoy reading either type of book.\n\nDONE."

How many students enjoy reading fiction but not non-fiction?\n2. How many students enjoy reading non-fiction but not fiction?\n3. How many students don't enjoy reading either type of book? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I've got this problem here about a survey of 120 college students and their reading habits. Let me try to figure it out step by step. First, let's list out what we know:\n\n- Total students surveyed: 120\n- Students who enjoy reading fiction: 75\n- Students who enjoy reading non-fiction: 65\n- Students who enjoy both fiction and non-fiction: 40\n\nAnd the questions are:\n\n1. How many students enjoy reading fiction but not non-fiction?\n2. How many students enjoy reading non-fiction but not fiction?\n3. How many students don't enjoy reading either type of book?\n\nOkay, starting with question 1: How many students enjoy reading fiction but not non-fiction? Hmm. So, this is about students who like fiction but don't like non-fiction at all. I remember something about sets and maybe using a Venn diagram for this kind of problem. So, if I imagine two overlapping circles, one for fiction and one for non-fiction, the overlapping part is the students who enjoy both.\n\nGiven that 75 students enjoy fiction and 65 enjoy non-fiction, and 40 enjoy both, I think I can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion here. The formula for the total number of students who enjoy either fiction or non-fiction or both would be:\n\nTotal = (Number who enjoy Fiction) + (Number who enjoy Non-Fiction) - (Number who enjoy Both)\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers: 75 + 65 - 40. Let me calculate that: 75 + 65 is 140, minus 40 is 100. So, 100 students enjoy either fiction or non-fiction or both.\n\nBut wait, the total number of students surveyed is 120. So, the number of students who don't enjoy either would be the total minus those who enjoy at least one. That is, 120 - 100 = 20. Okay, so 20 students don't enjoy reading either type of book. That might be useful for question 3.\n\nBut back to question 1. How many enjoy fiction but not non-fiction? I think this is the number of students in the fiction circle who are not in the non-fiction circle. So, that would be the total who enjoy fiction minus those who enjoy both. So, 75 - 40 = 35. So, 35 students enjoy only fiction, not non-fiction.\n\nLet me double-check that. If 40 enjoy both, then 75 - 40 = 35 must be fiction only. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nNow, question 2: How many students enjoy reading non-fiction but not fiction? Similar logic. It's the number of students in the non-fiction circle who are not in the fiction circle. So, that's 65 - 40 = 25. So, 25 students enjoy only non-fiction.\n\nAnd then question 3, which we kind of already answered indirectly: 120 total minus the 100 who enjoy either, so 20 don't enjoy either.\n\nLet me make sure all these numbers add up correctly. So, 35 (fiction only) + 25 (non-fiction only) + 40 (both) = 100. Plus the 20 who don't read either, that's 120 total. Yep, that checks out.\n\nI think that's it. So, the answers are 35, 25, and 20.\n</think>\n\n1. The number of students who enjoy reading fiction but not non-fiction is 35.\n2. The number of students who enjoy reading non-fiction but not fiction is 25.\n3. The number of students who don't enjoy reading either type of book is 20.\n\nDONE."

Let me try to figure this out step by step. Okay, so first, the data given is:\n\n- 75 students enjoy reading fiction.\n- 65 students enjoy reading non-fiction.\n- 40 students enjoy both fiction and non-fiction.\n\nAnd the questions are asking:\n\n1. How many students enjoy reading fiction but not non-fiction?\n2. How many students enjoy reading non-fiction but not fiction?\n3. How many students don't enjoy reading either type of book?\n\nHmm, okay. So, I think this is a problem about sets and maybe using a Venn diagram to visualize it. Let me recall what I know about sets. There's the principle of inclusion-exclusion, right? Which says that the total number in either set A or set B is equal to the number in A plus the number in B minus the number in both A and B. \n\nSo, in this case, the total number of students is 120. Let me denote:\n\n- Let F be the set of students who enjoy reading fiction. So, |F| = 75.\n- Let N be the set of students who enjoy reading non-fiction. So, |N| = 65.\n- The intersection of F and N, which is F \u2229 N, is 40 students.\n\nSo, according to the inclusion-exclusion principle, the total number of students who enjoy reading either fiction or non-fiction or both is |F \u222a N| = |F| + |N| - |F \u2229 N|. Plugging in the numbers, that would be 75 + 65 - 40. Let me compute that:\n\n75 + 65 is 140. Then subtract 40, which gives 100. So, 100 students enjoy reading either fiction or non-fiction or both.\n\nBut wait, the total number of students surveyed is 120. So, the number of students who don't enjoy reading either type of book would be the total minus those who enjoy at least one type. That is, 120 - 100 = 20 students. Okay, so that's the answer to question 3: 20 students don't enjoy either.\n\nNow, for question 1: How many students enjoy reading fiction but not non-fiction? That would be the number of students in set F but not in set N. I think this is calculated by subtracting the intersection from the total in F. So, |F| - |F \u2229 N| = 75 - 40 = 35 students. So, 35 students enjoy only fiction.\n\nSimilarly, for question 2: How many students enjoy reading non-fiction but not fiction? That would be |N| - |F \u2229 N| = 65 - 40 = 25 students. So, 25 students enjoy only non-fiction.\n\nLet me just double-check these numbers to make sure they add up correctly. So, if 35 enjoy only fiction, 25 enjoy only non-fiction, and 40 enjoy both, then the total number of students who enjoy reading is 35 + 25 + 40 = 100, which matches what I found earlier. And the remaining 20 don't enjoy either, which also makes sense because 100 + 20 = 120, the total number of students.\n\nSo, I think that's all correct.\n</think>\n\n1. **Students who enjoy reading fiction but not non-fiction:**  \n   To find students who enjoy only fiction, subtract those who enjoy both from the total who enjoy fiction.  \n   \\( 75 - 40 = 35 \\)  \n   **Answer:** 35 students.\n\n2. **Students who enjoy reading non-fiction but not fiction:**  \n   Similarly, subtract those who enjoy both from the total who enjoy non-fiction.  \n   \\( 65 - 40 = 25 \\)  \n   **Answer:** 25 students.\n\n3. **Students who don't enjoy reading either type of book:**  \n   Subtract the number of students who enjoy at least one type from the total surveyed.  \n   \\( 120 - 100 = 20 \\)  \n   **Answer:** 20 students.\n\n**DONE.**"

Let me see if I can figure out the answers to these questions. Okay, first, let's list out what we know.\n\nWe have a total of 120 college students surveyed. Out of these:\n\n- 75 students enjoy reading fiction.\n- 65 students enjoy reading non-fiction.\n- 40 students enjoy reading both fiction and non-fiction.\n\nHmm, so I think this is a problem about sets and maybe using a Venn diagram to visualize it. I remember something about the principle of inclusion-exclusion from math class, which might help here.\n\nThe first question is: How many students enjoy reading fiction but not non-fiction? Okay, so that's the number of students who like fiction minus those who like both fiction and non-fiction. Because those 40 students who like both are already included in the 75 who like fiction, so if I subtract them, I should get the number who only like fiction.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nFiction only = Total fiction - Both fiction and non-fiction\nFiction only = 75 - 40 = 35\n\nSo, 35 students enjoy reading fiction but not non-fiction. That seems straightforward.\n\nMoving on to the second question: How many students enjoy reading non-fiction but not fiction? Hmm, similar logic here. The total number of students who enjoy non-fiction is 65, but that includes those who also enjoy both. So, to find just those who like non-fiction but not fiction, I should subtract the 40 who like both from the total non-fiction.\n\nNon-fiction only = Total non-fiction - Both fiction and non-fiction\nNon-fiction only = 65 - 40 = 25\n\nOkay, so 25 students enjoy reading non-fiction but not fiction.\n\nNow, the third question is a bit trickier: How many students don't enjoy reading either type of book? So, that means these are the students who don't fall into either the fiction-only, non-fiction-only, or both categories. To find this, I think I can subtract the total number of students who enjoy any type of reading from the total number surveyed.\n\nSo, let's calculate the total number of students who enjoy fiction or non-fiction or both. That would be the sum of fiction-only, non-fiction-only, and both.\n\nTotal reading = Fiction only + Non-fiction only + Both\nTotal reading = 35 + 25 + 40 = 100\n\nWait, so 100 students enjoy reading either fiction, non-fiction, or both. Since the total number surveyed is 120, the number of students who don't enjoy either would be the total minus those who enjoy reading.\n\nNeither = Total students - Total reading\nNeither = 120 - 100 = 20\n\nSo, 20 students don't enjoy reading either type of book.\n\nLet me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Adding up the numbers:\n\n- Fiction only: 35\n- Non-fiction only: 25\n- Both: 40\n- Neither: 20\n\nAdding these up: 35 + 25 + 40 + 20 = 120, which matches the total number of students. So that seems correct.\n\nI think I've got all the answers now.\n</think>\n\n1. **Fiction only**: 35 students  \n2. **Non-fiction only**: 25 students  \n3. **Neither**: 20 students  \n\nDONE."

How many students don't enjoy reading either type of book? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this problem about a survey of 120 college students and their reading preferences. It says 75 students enjoy reading fiction, 65 enjoy reading non-fiction, and 40 enjoy both. I need to find out three things: how many enjoy fiction but not non-fiction, how many enjoy non-fiction but not fiction, and how many don't enjoy either.\n\nFirst, I think I need to visualize this data. Maybe using a Venn diagram would help. I remember that in set theory, the total number in either set A or set B is equal to the number in A plus the number in B minus the number in both A and B. So, that formula is |A \u222a B| = |A| + |B| - |A \u2229 B|. \n\nGiven that, the total number of students is 120. So, |A \u222a B| can't be more than 120. Let me plug in the numbers: |A| is 75 (fiction), |B| is 65 (non-fiction), and |A \u2229 B| is 40 (both). So, |A \u222a B| = 75 + 65 - 40. That's 140 - 40, which equals 100. Wait, that means 100 students enjoy either fiction or non-fiction or both. But the total number surveyed is 120, so how many don't enjoy either? That would be 120 - 100 = 20. Okay, so 20 students don't read either type of book. That answers the third question.\n\nNow, for the first question: how many enjoy fiction but not non-fiction. That should be the number who enjoy only fiction, which is |A| - |A \u2229 B|. So, 75 - 40 = 35. So, 35 students enjoy only fiction.\n\nSimilarly, for the second question: how many enjoy non-fiction but not fiction. That would be |B| - |A \u2229 B|. So, 65 - 40 = 25. Therefore, 25 students enjoy only non-fiction.\n\nLet me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. \n\n- Total students: 120\n- Fiction only: 75 - 40 = 35\n- Non-fiction only: 65 - 40 = 25\n- Both: 40\n- Neither: 120 - (35 + 25 + 40) = 120 - 100 = 20\n\nYes, that adds up correctly. 35 + 25 + 40 = 100, and 100 + 20 = 120. So, everything checks out.\n</think>\n\n1. **Students who enjoy reading fiction but not non-fiction:**  \n   To find the number of students who enjoy only fiction, subtract those who enjoy both from the total who enjoy fiction.  \n   \\( 75 - 40 = 35 \\)  \n   So, **35 students** enjoy reading fiction but not non-fiction.\n\n2. **Students who enjoy reading non-fiction but not fiction:**  \n   Similarly, subtract those who enjoy both from the total who enjoy non-fiction.  \n   \\( 65 - 40 = 25 \\)  \n   So, **25 students** enjoy reading non-fiction but not fiction.\n\n3. **Students who don't enjoy reading either type of book:**  \n   Subtract the number of students who enjoy either fiction, non-fiction, or both from the total number surveyed.  \n   \\( 120 - (75 + 65 - 40) = 120 - 100 = 20 \\)  \n   So, **20 students** don't enjoy reading either type of book.\n\n**DONE.**"

How many students don't enjoy reading either type of book? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this survey data about college students and their reading preferences. Let me see how to approach this. The total number of students surveyed is 120. The data given is:\n\n- 75 students enjoy reading fiction.\n- 65 students enjoy reading non-fiction.\n- 40 students enjoy both fiction and non-fiction.\n\nHmm, okay, so I think this is a problem about sets and their overlaps. Maybe I can use a Venn diagram to visualize it. There are two sets: one for fiction lovers and one for non-fiction lovers. The overlap between them is the 40 students who enjoy both.\n\nI remember something about the principle of inclusion-exclusion. It says that the total number in either set is equal to the sum of the numbers in each set minus the number in their intersection. So, in formula terms, that would be:\n\nTotal = Fiction + Non-Fiction - Both\n\nLet me plug in the numbers:\n\nTotal surveyed = 120\nFiction = 75\nNon-Fiction = 65\nBoth = 40\n\nSo,\n\n120 = 75 + 65 - Both\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because 75 plus 65 is 140, which is more than 120. So, if I plug in Both as 40,\n\n120 = 75 + 65 - 40\n\nYes, 75 + 65 is 140, minus 40 gives 100. But wait, that's not 120. Did I do something wrong?\n\nOh, I think I misapplied the formula. The formula should actually be:\n\nTotal = Fiction + Non-Fiction - Both\n\nSo,\n\n120 = 75 + 65 - Both\n\nWait, that's not right because 75 + 65 is 140, which is more than 120. So, the Both can't be 40 because that would give a total of 100. But the actual total surveyed is 120. Hmm, maybe I need to reconsider.\n\nWait, maybe I need to find the number of students who don't enjoy either, which is part of the question. Let me think.\n\nThe question asks for three things:\n\n1. Students who enjoy fiction but not non-fiction.\n2. Students who enjoy non-fiction but not fiction.\n3. Students who don't enjoy either.\n\nSo, maybe I should break it down that way.\n\nFirst, let's find the number who enjoy only fiction. That would be total fiction lovers minus those who enjoy both.\n\nOnly Fiction = Fiction - Both = 75 - 40 = 35\n\nSimilarly, Only Non-Fiction = Non-Fiction - Both = 65 - 40 = 25\n\nSo, now, adding Only Fiction and Only Non-Fiction, and the Both, we have:\n\n35 (Only Fiction) + 25 (Only Non-Fiction) + 40 (Both) = 100\n\nBut the total surveyed is 120, so there are 120 - 100 = 20 students who don't enjoy either.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, the numbers are:\n\n- Only Fiction: 35\n- Only Non-Fiction: 25\n- Both: 40\n- Neither: 20\n\nSo, to answer the questions:\n\n1. How many enjoy fiction but not non-fiction? That's Only Fiction, which is 35.\n2. How many enjoy non-fiction but not fiction? That's Only Non-Fiction, which is 25.\n3. How many don't enjoy either? That's 20.\n\nLet me double-check. If I add up the numbers: 35 + 25 + 40 + 20 = 120, which matches the total. So, that seems correct.\n</think>\n\n1. **Students who enjoy reading fiction but not non-fiction**:  \n   Only Fiction = Total Fiction - Both = 75 - 40 = 35\n\n2. **Students who enjoy reading non-fiction but not fiction**:  \n   Only Non-Fiction = Total Non-Fiction - Both = 65 - 40 = 25\n\n3. **Students who don't enjoy reading either type of book**:  \n   Neither = Total Surveyed - (Only Fiction + Only Non-Fiction + Both)  \n   = 120 - (35 + 25 + 40) = 20\n\n**Answer:**\n1. 35 students  \n2. 25 students  \n3. 20 students  \n\nDONE."

That makes sense because if we just add F and NF, we're double-counting those who enjoy both, so we subtract the overlap once.\n\nLet me compute each part step by step.\n\nFirst, for the number of students who enjoy only fiction:\n\nF only = F - (F \u2229 NF) = 75 - 40 = 35\n\nSo, 35 students enjoy reading fiction but not non-fiction.\n\nNext, the number of students who enjoy only non-fiction:\n\nNF only = NF - (F \u2229 NF) = 65 - 40 = 25\n\nSo, 25 students enjoy reading non-fiction but not fiction.\n\nNow, for the number of students who don't enjoy either:\n\nStudents who don't enjoy either = Total - (F + NF - (F \u2229 NF)) = 120 - (75 + 65 - 40)\n\nLet me calculate inside the parentheses first:\n\n75 + 65 = 140\n\n140 - 40 = 100\n\nSo, 120 - 100 = 20\n\nTherefore, 20 students don't enjoy reading either type of book.\n\nWait, let me double-check these calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFor F only: 75 total fiction lovers minus 40 who also like non-fiction gives 35. That seems right.\n\nFor NF only: 65 total non-fiction lovers minus 40 who also like fiction gives 25. That also makes sense.\n\nFor those who don't enjoy either: total is 120. If 75+65=140, but 40 are in both, so the unique count is 140 - 40=100. So, 120 - 100=20. Yep, that checks out.\n\nI think that's all correct. So, the answers should be 35, 25, and 20 for the respective questions.\n</think>\n\n1. **Students who enjoy reading fiction but not non-fiction**: 35  \n2. **Students who enjoy reading non-fiction but not fiction**: 25  \n3. **Students who don't enjoy reading either type of book**: 20  \n\nDONE."

End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: In a survey of 120 college students, the following information was gathered:\n- 75 students enjoy reading fiction\n- 65 students enjoy reading non-fiction\n- 40 students enjoy reading both fiction and non-fiction\n\nBased on this information, answer the following questions:\n1. How many students enjoy reading fiction but not non-fiction?\n2. How many students enjoy reading non-fiction but not fiction?\n3. How many students don't enjoy reading either type of book? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this survey data about college students and their reading habits. Let me try to make sense of it step by step. \n\nFirst, the total number of students surveyed is 120. Okay, that's straightforward. Now, the data breaks down into three categories:\n1. Students who enjoy reading fiction: 75\n2. Students who enjoy reading non-fiction: 65\n3. Students who enjoy both fiction and non-fiction: 40\n\nHmm, so I need to figure out three things:\n1. How many students enjoy only fiction, not non-fiction.\n2. How many enjoy only non-fiction, not fiction.\n3. How many don't enjoy either type.\n\nLet me recall some set theory principles here. I think the formula for the union of two sets is:\nTotal = Number in Fiction + Number in Non-Fiction - Number in Both + Neither\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers I have:\n120 = 75 + 65 - 40 + Neither\n\nLet me calculate that:\n75 + 65 is 140.\n140 - 40 is 100.\nSo, 120 = 100 + Neither\nThat means Neither = 120 - 100 = 20.\n\nOkay, so 20 students don't enjoy either type. That answers the third question.\n\nNow, for the first question: Students who enjoy only fiction. That would be the total in Fiction minus those who enjoy both.\nSo, Only Fiction = 75 - 40 = 35.\n\nSimilarly, for the second question: Students who enjoy only non-fiction.\nOnly Non-Fiction = 65 - 40 = 25.\n\nLet me double-check these numbers to make sure they add up correctly. \n\nOnly Fiction: 35\nOnly Non-Fiction: 25\nBoth: 40\nNeither: 20\n\nAdding them up: 35 + 25 + 40 + 20 = 120. Perfect, that matches the total surveyed.\n\nSo, the numbers seem to add up correctly. I think that's it!\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion for sets.\n\nGiven:\n- Total students surveyed, \\( T = 120 \\)\n- Students who enjoy reading fiction, \\( F = 75 \\)\n- Students who enjoy reading non-fiction, \\( N = 65 \\)\n- Students who enjoy both, \\( F \\cap N = 40 \\)\n\nWe need to find:\n1. Students who enjoy reading fiction but not non-fiction: \\( F - (F \\cap N) \\)\n2. Students who enjoy reading non-fiction but not fiction: \\( N - (F \\cap N) \\)\n3. Students who don't enjoy reading either type: \\( T - (F + N - (F \\cap N)) \\)\n\nCalculations:\n1. Only Fiction: \\( 75 - 40 = 35 \\)\n2. Only Non-Fiction: \\( 65 - 40 = 25 \\)\n3. Neither: \\( 120 - (75 + 65 - 40) = 120 - 100 = 20 \\)\n\n**Answer:**\n1. 35 students enjoy reading fiction but not non-fiction.\n2. 25 students enjoy reading non-fiction but not fiction.\n3. 20 students don't enjoy reading either type of book.\n\nDONE."

End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: In a survey of 120 college students, the following information was gathered:\n- 75 students enjoy reading fiction\n- 65 students enjoy reading non-fiction\n- 40 students enjoy reading both fiction and non-fiction\n\nBased on this information, answer the following questions:\n1. How many students enjoy reading fiction but not non-fiction?\n2. How many students enjoy reading non-fiction but not fiction?\n3. How many students don't enjoy reading either type of book? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I've got this survey data about college students and their reading habits. Let me try to figure out the answers step by step. \n\nFirst, the total number of students surveyed is 120. That's good to know because it will help me check my work later. Now, the data provided is:\n\n- 75 students enjoy reading fiction.\n- 65 students enjoy reading non-fiction.\n- 40 students enjoy both fiction and non-fiction.\n\nOkay, so the first thing that comes to mind is that this is a problem about sets and their overlaps. I remember something about using Venn diagrams for these kinds of questions, where you have two overlapping circles representing the different groups.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- Let F be the set of students who enjoy reading fiction.\n- Let N be the set of students who enjoy reading non-fiction.\n- The intersection of F and N, which is F \u2229 N, represents the students who enjoy both.\n\nSo, according to the problem:\n\n- |F| = 75\n- |N| = 65\n- |F \u2229 N| = 40\n\nNow, the questions are:\n\n1. How many students enjoy reading fiction but not non-fiction?\n2. How many students enjoy reading non-fiction but not fiction?\n3. How many students don't enjoy reading either type of book?\n\nStarting with question 1: How many students enjoy reading fiction but not non-fiction?\n\nHmm, so this is the number of students who are in set F but not in set N. In set notation, that would be |F - N|. To find this, I can subtract the number of students who enjoy both from the total number who enjoy fiction.\n\nSo, |F - N| = |F| - |F \u2229 N| = 75 - 40 = 35\n\nWait, is that right? Let me think again. If 40 students like both, then those 40 are already included in the 75 who like fiction. So, to find those who like only fiction, I subtract the overlap from the total fiction lovers. So yes, 75 minus 40 is 35. That makes sense.\n\nMoving on to question 2: How many students enjoy reading non-fiction but not fiction?\n\nSimilarly, this should be the number of students in set N but not in set F. Using the same logic, we can subtract the overlap from the total non-fiction lovers.\n\nSo, |N - F| = |N| - |F \u2229 N| = 65 - 40 = 25\n\nOkay, that seems straightforward. So, 25 students like non-fiction but not fiction.\n\nNow, question 3: How many students don't enjoy reading either type of book?\n\nThis is the number of students who are not in either set F or N. In set terms, that's the total number minus those in F, N, or both. But to avoid double-counting the overlap, I need to use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\n\nThe formula for the union of two sets is:\n\n|F \u222a N| = |F| + |N| - |F \u2229 N|\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers:\n\n|F \u222a N| = 75 + 65 - 40 = 100\n\nTherefore, 100 students enjoy reading either fiction or non-fiction or both. But the total number surveyed is 120, so the number of students who don't enjoy either is:\n\n120 - |F \u222a N| = 120 - 100 = 20\n\nSo, 20 students don't enjoy reading either type of book.\n\nLet me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFor question 1: 75 - 40 = 35 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor question 2: 65 - 40 = 25 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor question 3: 75 + 65 = 140; 140 - 40 = 100; 120 - 100 = 20 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nEverything adds up. So, I think I've got the right answers.\n</think>\n\n1. The number of students who enjoy reading fiction but not non-fiction is **35**.\n\n2. The number of students who enjoy reading non-fiction but not fiction is **25**.\n\n3. The number of students who don't enjoy reading either type of book is **20**.\n\nDONE."

How many students enjoy reading fiction but not non-fiction?\n2. How many students enjoy reading non-fiction but not fiction?\n3. How many students don't enjoy reading either type of book? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this survey data about college students and their reading habits. Let me try to figure out the answers step by step. \n\nFirst, the total number of students surveyed is 120. Out of these, 75 enjoy reading fiction, 65 enjoy reading non-fiction, and 40 enjoy both fiction and non-fiction. Hmm, okay. So, I think this is a problem involving sets and maybe using a Venn diagram to visualize it.\n\nLet me recall the principle of inclusion-exclusion for sets. It says that the total number of students who enjoy reading fiction or non-fiction or both is equal to the number who enjoy fiction plus the number who enjoy non-fiction minus the number who enjoy both. So, in formula terms, that would be:\n\nTotal = Fiction + Non-Fiction - Both\n\nPlugging in the numbers I have:\n\n120 = 75 + 65 - 40\n\nLet me calculate that. 75 plus 65 is 140. Then subtracting 40 gives me 100. So, 120 = 100. Wait, that doesn't make sense because 100 is not equal to 120. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the formula or the numbers given.\n\nWait, no, actually, the total number of students surveyed is 120, so the number of students who enjoy either fiction or non-fiction or both should be 120. But according to the formula, it's 75 + 65 - 40 = 100. That's a discrepancy. So, what does that mean? Maybe the survey didn't cover all students, or perhaps some students don't enjoy either type of book. That must be it.\n\nSo, the number of students who enjoy at least one of the two types of books is 100, which leaves 120 - 100 = 20 students who don't enjoy reading either fiction or non-fiction. Okay, that answers question 3 indirectly. \n\nNow, moving on to question 1: How many students enjoy reading fiction but not non-fiction? To find this, I think I need to subtract those who enjoy both from those who enjoy fiction. So, it would be 75 (fiction) minus 40 (both) = 35 students who enjoy only fiction.\n\nSimilarly, for question 2: How many students enjoy reading non-fiction but not fiction? That should be 65 (non-fiction) minus 40 (both) = 25 students who enjoy only non-fiction.\n\nLet me double-check these calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nFor question 1: 75 - 40 = 35. That seems right.\n\nFor question 2: 65 - 40 = 25. Also correct.\n\nAnd for the total, 35 (only fiction) + 25 (only non-fiction) + 40 (both) = 100 students. Adding the 20 who don't enjoy either, we get 120, which matches the total surveyed. So, everything checks out.\n\nI think I've got it now.\n</think>\n\n1. **Students who enjoy reading fiction but not non-fiction:**  \n   To find this, subtract the number of students who enjoy both from those who enjoy fiction.  \n   \\( 75 \\) (fiction) - \\( 40 \\) (both) = \\( 35 \\) students.\n\n2. **Students who enjoy reading non-fiction but not fiction:**  \n   Subtract the number of students who enjoy both from those who enjoy non-fiction.  \n   \\( 65 \\) (non-fiction) - \\( 40 \\) (both) = \\( 25 \\) students.\n\n3. **Students who don't enjoy reading either type of book:**  \n   Subtract the total number of students who enjoy at least one type of book from the total surveyed.  \n   \\( 120 \\) (total) - \\( 100 \\) (fiction or non-fiction or both) = \\( 20 \\) students.\n\n**Answers:**\n1. \\( 35 \\) students  \n2. \\( 25 \\) students  \n3. \\( 20 \\) students  \n\nDONE."
