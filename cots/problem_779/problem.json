  "question": "At a small publishing company, four editors\u2014Alex, Bianca, Carlos, and Diana\u2014each specialize in exactly one genre: mystery, romance, science fiction, or western. Based on the following clues, determine which editor specializes in which genre:\n\n1. Alex does not specialize in mystery or western.\n2. The editor who specializes in science fiction sits next to Carlos in the office.\n3. Bianca and the romance editor are good friends.\n4. Diana's genre has guns but no spaceships.\n\nNote: 'Sits next to' means in adjacent offices.",
  "answer": "Let's solve this step by step using logical deduction:\n\nStep 1: From clue 1, we know Alex doesn't specialize in mystery or western. So Alex must specialize in either romance or science fiction.\n\nStep 2: From clue 4, Diana's genre has guns but no spaceships. This description fits western (which typically features guns) but not science fiction (which would have spaceships). So Diana specializes in western.\n\nStep 3: From clue 2, we know the science fiction editor sits next to Carlos. This means Carlos is not the science fiction editor.\n\nStep 4: Since Diana specializes in western and Alex can't specialize in western or mystery, Carlos must specialize in either mystery or science fiction. But from Step 3, we know Carlos isn't the science fiction editor. Therefore, Carlos specializes in mystery.\n\nStep 5: Now we need to determine who specializes in romance and who specializes in science fiction. The remaining options are Alex and Bianca.\n\nStep 6: From clue 3, Bianca and the romance editor are good friends. This implies Bianca is not the romance editor (as the clue distinguishes between Bianca and the romance editor). Therefore, Bianca must be the science fiction editor.\n\nStep 7: Since Bianca specializes in science fiction, the only remaining option for Alex is romance.\n\nStep 8: From clue 2, we can also verify our solution: the science fiction editor (Bianca) sits next to Carlos, which is consistent with our assignments.\n\nFinal answer:\n- Alex specializes in romance\n- Bianca specializes in science fiction\n- Carlos specializes in mystery\n- Diana specializes in western"
