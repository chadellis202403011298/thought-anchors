In other words, prove that 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2n-1) = n\u00b2 for all positive integers n. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I need to prove by mathematical induction that the sum of the first n odd positive integers equals n squared. Hmm, okay, let me recall how mathematical induction works. From what I remember, it involves two main steps: the base case and the inductive step. \n\nFirst, I should verify the base case, which is usually n=1. Let me check that. The sum of the first 1 odd positive integer is just 1, right? And 1 squared is also 1. So, that checks out. The base case holds.\n\nNow, moving on to the inductive step. This is where I assume that the statement is true for some arbitrary positive integer k. That is, I assume that the sum of the first k odd positive integers is equal to k squared. So, let me write that down: \n\n1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k - 1) = k\u00b2.\n\nOkay, that's my inductive hypothesis. Now, I need to show that if this is true for n=k, then it must also be true for n=k+1. In other words, I need to prove that the sum up to the (k+1)th odd integer is equal to (k+1) squared.\n\nSo, the sum up to the (k+1)th odd integer would be 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k - 1) + (2(k+1) - 1). Let me compute that last term: 2(k+1) - 1 is 2k + 2 - 1, which simplifies to 2k + 1.\n\nSo, the sum becomes the sum up to the kth term plus (2k + 1). From my inductive hypothesis, the sum up to the kth term is k\u00b2. So, the total sum is k\u00b2 + (2k + 1). Let me write that out: \n\nk\u00b2 + 2k + 1.\n\nHmm, that looks familiar. I think that's a perfect square. Let me check: (k + 1) squared is k\u00b2 + 2k + 1. Yes, that's exactly it! So, the sum up to the (k+1)th odd integer is (k + 1) squared.\n\nTherefore, by mathematical induction, the statement holds for all positive integers n. \n\nWait, did I skip any steps here? Let me go through it again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nBase case: n=1, sum=1, 1\u00b2=1. Correct.\n\nInductive step: Assume sum up to k is k\u00b2. Then sum up to k+1 is k\u00b2 + (2k+1) = (k + 1)\u00b2. That seems right. Yeah, I think that works. \n\nI guess another way to think about it is by visualizing the odd numbers. Each new odd number added is 2 more than the previous even number, but I'm not sure if that helps here. The induction approach seems straightforward.\n\nAlso, just to double-check, maybe I can test it for a small value, like n=2. The sum should be 1 + 3 = 4, which is 2\u00b2. Yep, that's correct. For n=3, 1 + 3 + 5 = 9, which is 3\u00b2. That works too. So, the formula seems to hold for these small cases, which gives me more confidence in the proof.\n\nI think I'm all set. The inductive step seems to logically follow, and the base case is verified. So, the proof is complete.\nDONE.\n</think>\n\nTo prove by mathematical induction that for all positive integers \\( n \\), the sum of the first \\( n \\) odd positive integers equals \\( n^2 \\), follow these steps:\n\n**Base Case (\\( n = 1 \\)):**\nThe sum of the first 1 odd positive integer is \\( 1 \\).\n\\[\n1 = 1^2\n\\]\nThus, the base case holds.\n\n**Inductive Step:**\nAssume that the statement is true for some arbitrary positive integer \\( k \\).

Hmm, induction usually involves two steps: the base case and the inductive step. Let me try to recall how induction works. \n\nFirst, I should check the base case, which is usually n=1. So, when n is 1, the sum is just the first odd positive integer, which is 1. And 1 squared is also 1. So, the base case holds true because 1 equals 1\u00b2. That makes sense.\n\nNow, for the inductive step, I need to assume that the statement is true for some arbitrary positive integer k, and then show that it must also be true for k+1. So, let me write that down. \n\nAssume that for n = k, the sum of the first k odd positive integers is k\u00b2. That is, 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k - 1) = k\u00b2.\n\nNow, I need to show that the sum up to k+1 odd numbers is equal to (k+1) squared. That is, I need to show that 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k - 1) + (2(k+1) - 1) equals (k+1)\u00b2.\n\nWait, let me make sure I have that right. The next odd number after 2k - 1 would be 2(k+1) - 1, which simplifies to 2k + 2 - 1, which is 2k +1. So, the sum up to k+1 terms would be the sum up to k terms plus the next odd number, which is 2k +1.\n\nSo, if the sum up to k terms is k\u00b2, then adding 2k +1 should give me (k+1)\u00b2. Let me write that out:\n\nSum up to k+1 terms = Sum up to k terms + (2k +1) = k\u00b2 + 2k +1.\n\nNow, I need to see if k\u00b2 + 2k +1 equals (k+1)\u00b2. Let me expand (k+1)\u00b2. That's k\u00b2 + 2k +1. So, yes, that matches exactly. Therefore, the sum up to k+1 terms is indeed (k+1)\u00b2.\n\nSince both the base case and the inductive step have been proven, by mathematical induction, the sum of the first n odd positive integers equals n\u00b2 for all positive integers n.\n\nWait, did I just do that correctly? Let me double-check. Base case: n=1, sum=1, which is 1\u00b2. Inductive step: Assume sum up to k is k\u00b2. Then sum up to k+1 is k\u00b2 + (2k+1) = k\u00b2 + 2k +1 = (k+1)\u00b2.

That is, 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2n-1) = n\u00b2 for all positive integers n. Hmm, okay, induction seems like a good approach here. Let me recall how mathematical induction works.\n\nFirst, I remember that induction involves two main steps: the base case and the inductive step. The base case is where I prove that the statement holds true for n = 1. Then, in the inductive step, I assume that the statement is true for some arbitrary positive integer k, and then I prove that it must also be true for k + 1. If both steps are successful, then by induction, the statement holds for all positive integers.\n\nSo, let's start with the base case. For n = 1, the sum of the first 1 odd positive integer is just 1. On the right side, we have 1\u00b2, which is also 1. Therefore, the base case holds true because both sides equal 1.\n\nOkay, that part was straightforward. Now, onto the inductive step. Let's assume that the statement is true for some arbitrary positive integer k. That is, assume that 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k-1) = k\u00b2. This is my inductive hypothesis.\n\nNow, I need to show that the statement also holds for k + 1. That is, I need to prove that 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k-1) + (2(k+1)-1) = (k+1)\u00b2. Simplifying the left side, the sum up to k terms is k\u00b2, as per my inductive hypothesis. Then, adding the next term, which is (2(k+1)-1) = 2k + 2 - 1 = 2k + 1, gives me k\u00b2 + (2k + 1).\n\nSo, now I have k\u00b2 + 2k + 1. Hmm, that looks familiar. Let me see, k\u00b2 + 2k + 1 is equal to (k + 1)\u00b2, because (k + 1)\u00b2 = k\u00b2 + 2k + 1. Therefore, the left side becomes (k + 1)\u00b2, which is exactly the right side of the equation I needed to prove for k + 1.\n\nWait, that seems to work out perfectly. So, by the principle of mathematical induction, since the base case holds and the inductive step has been proven, the statement is true for all positive integers n.\n\nBut, let me double-check my inductive step to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. I assumed the sum up to k terms is k\u00b2, then added the (k+1)th term, which is 2k + 1. So, the sum becomes k\u00b2 + 2k + 1, which is indeed (k + 1)\u00b2. Yep, that looks correct.\n\nIs there another way to think about this? Maybe by actually computing the sum for a small value of k and seeing if it matches k\u00b2. Let's try k = 2. The sum of the first 2 odd numbers is 1 + 3 = 4, which is 2\u00b2. For k = 3, 1 + 3 + 5 = 9, which is 3\u00b2. And for k = 4, 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16, which is 4\u00b2. It seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, I remember that the sum of an arithmetic series can be calculated using the formula: (number of terms)/2 * (first term + last term). In this case, the first term is 1, the last term is 2n - 1, and the number of terms is n. So, the sum should be (n/2) * (1 + (2n - 1)) = (n/2) * (2n) = n\u00b2. That aligns with the statement we're trying to prove. So, that's another way to see it.\n\nBut since the problem specifically asks for induction, I should stick to that method. I think I've covered all the necessary steps. The base case is verified, the inductive hypothesis is assumed, and the inductive step is proven by showing that adding the next odd number results in (k + 1)\u00b2. Therefore, by induction, the statement holds for all positive integers n.\n\nI don't see any gaps or errors in my reasoning. It all seems to fit together logically.

This is where I assume that the statement is true for some arbitrary positive integer k, and then I have to show that it must also be true for k+1. So, let me assume that the sum of the first k odd positive integers is equal to k squared. In other words, 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k-1) = k\u00b2. That's my inductive hypothesis.\n\nNext, I need to show that the sum up to k+1 odd integers is equal to (k+1) squared. So, the sum would be 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k-1) + (2(k+1)-1). Wait, what is 2(k+1)-1? Let me compute that. That would be 2k + 2 - 1, which simplifies to 2k + 1. So, the next odd integer after 2k-1 is 2k+1.\n\nSo, the sum up to k+1 is the sum up to k plus 2k+1. According to my inductive hypothesis, the sum up to k is k\u00b2. Therefore, the sum up to k+1 would be k\u00b2 + (2k + 1). Now, I need to simplify this expression and see if it equals (k+1) squared.\n\nLet me compute k\u00b2 + 2k + 1. Hmm, that looks familiar. Isn't that a perfect square? Yes, because (k + 1) squared is k\u00b2 + 2k + 1. So, the sum up to k+1 is (k+1)\u00b2, which is exactly what we wanted to prove.\n\nWait, did I do that correctly? Let me double-check. So, starting from the inductive hypothesis, adding the next odd number, which is 2k+1, and then showing that the total is (k+1)\u00b2. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me test it with a specific example. Let's take k=2. The sum of the first 2 odd numbers is 1 + 3 = 4, which is 2\u00b2. Now, for k+1=3, the sum should be 1 + 3 + 5 = 9, which is 3\u00b2. According to my inductive step, the sum up to 3 should be (2)\u00b2 + (2*2 +1) = 4 + 5 = 9, which matches. Okay, that works.\n\nAnother example: k=3. The sum is 1 + 3 + 5 = 9, which is 3\u00b2. Then, for k+1=4, the sum should be 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16, which is 4\u00b2. Using my inductive step, the sum up to 4 is 9 + 7 = 16. Perfect.\n\nSo, it seems like the inductive step holds for these examples, which gives me more confidence in the proof.\n\nWait, but is there another way to think about this? Maybe visualizing the sum. If I arrange the odd numbers in a certain way, does it form a square? For example, 1 is a square, 1 + 3 is a 2x2 square missing one corner, 1 + 3 + 5 is a 3x3 square missing some corners, and so on. Hmm, that's an interesting perspective, but I think the induction proof is sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, I remember something about arithmetic series. The sum of an arithmetic series is (number of terms)/2 times (first term + last term). In this case, the first term is 1, the last term is 2n -1, and the number of terms is n. So, plugging into the formula, the sum should be n/2 * (1 + (2n -1)) = n/2 * 2n = n\u00b2. That's another way to see it without induction, but since the problem asks for induction, I should stick to that.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me write down the induction proof step by step again. Base case: n=1, sum=1=1\u00b2. Inductive step: Assume sum up to k is k\u00b2. Then sum up to k+1 is k\u00b2 + (2k+1) = k\u00b2 + 2k +1 = (k+1)\u00b2. Therefore, by induction, the statement holds for all positive integers n.\n\nI think that covers it. I don't see any gaps or mistakes in the reasoning.

Hmm, induction. I remember that induction has two main steps: the base case and the inductive step. Let me try to recall how that works.\n\nFirst, the base case. I think that means I have to check if the statement is true for n = 1. So, when n is 1, the sum of the first 1 odd positive integer should be equal to 1 squared, which is 1. Let me write that down. The first odd positive integer is 1, so the sum is just 1. And 1 squared is also 1. So, 1 equals 1. That works. Okay, base case is done.\n\nNow, the inductive step. This is where I assume that the statement is true for some arbitrary positive integer k, and then I have to show that it's also true for k + 1. So, let me state my assumption. For some integer k \u2265 1, the sum of the first k odd positive integers is k squared. That is, 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k - 1) = k\u00b2.\n\nNow, I need to show that the sum up to k + 1 is equal to (k + 1) squared. So, the sum up to k + 1 would be 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k - 1) + (2(k + 1) - 1). Wait, let me make sure I get the next term right. The next odd number after 2k - 1 is 2(k + 1) - 1, which simplifies to 2k + 2 - 1, which is 2k + 1. So, the sum becomes k\u00b2 + (2k + 1).\n\nSo, I have to show that k\u00b2 + (2k + 1) equals (k + 1) squared. Let me compute (k + 1) squared. That's k\u00b2 + 2k + 1. Hmm, so k\u00b2 + 2k + 1 is exactly the same as k\u00b2 + (2k + 1). Therefore, the sum up to k + 1 is indeed (k + 1) squared.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. So, by induction, the statement holds for all positive integers n.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything. So, base case: n=1, sum is 1, which is 1\u00b2. Good. Inductive step: Assume it's true for n=k, so sum is k\u00b2. Then for n=k+1, sum is k\u00b2 + (2k+1) = k\u00b2 + 2k +1 = (k+1)\u00b2. That looks correct.\n\nI think that's all.

End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: Prove by mathematical induction that for all positive integers n, the sum of the first n odd positive integers equals n\u00b2. In other words, prove that 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2n-1) = n\u00b2 for all positive integers n. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I need to prove by mathematical induction that the sum of the first n odd positive integers equals n squared. Hmm, okay, let me recall what mathematical induction involves. From what I remember, it's a two-step process: the base case and the inductive step. \n\nFirst, the base case. That means I need to check if the statement holds true for n = 1. So, the sum of the first 1 odd positive integer would just be 1. And according to the formula, n squared when n=1 is 1 squared, which is also 1. So, the base case checks out. That makes sense.\n\nNow, onto the inductive step. This is where things get a bit trickier. I need to assume that the statement is true for some arbitrary positive integer k. That is, I'll assume that the sum of the first k odd positive integers is equal to k squared. So, 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k - 1) = k\u00b2. \n\nOkay, so assuming that's true, I need to show that the statement holds for k + 1. In other words, I need to prove that the sum of the first (k + 1) odd positive integers is equal to (k + 1) squared. \n\nTo do this, I should consider the sum up to k + 1. The sum up to k + 1 would be the sum up to k plus the next odd integer, which is (2(k + 1) - 1). Let me compute that: 2(k + 1) - 1 = 2k + 2 - 1 = 2k + 1. So, the next term is 2k + 1.\n\nSo, the sum up to k + 1 is the sum up to k plus (2k + 1). From my assumption, the sum up to k is k squared. Therefore, the sum up to k + 1 is k\u00b2 + (2k + 1). \n\nNow, I need to simplify this expression and see if it equals (k + 1) squared. Let me compute (k + 1) squared: (k + 1)\u00b2 = k\u00b2 + 2k + 1. \n\nWait a minute, that's exactly what I have! The sum up to k + 1 is k\u00b2 + 2k + 1, which is equal to (k + 1)\u00b2. So, that works out perfectly.\n\nHmm, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the inductive hypothesis: sum up to k is k\u00b2. Then, adding the next term, which is 2k + 1, gives k\u00b2 + 2k + 1. Expanding (k + 1)\u00b2 also gives k\u00b2 + 2k + 1. Yep, that matches. So, the inductive step holds.\n\nTherefore, by mathematical induction, the sum of the first n odd positive integers equals n squared for all positive integers n. That seems solid.\n\nJust to be thorough, maybe I should test it with another small value of n to ensure it works beyond the base case. Let's try n = 2. The sum of the first 2 odd positive integers is 1 + 3 = 4, and 2 squared is also 4. For n = 3, the sum is 1 + 3 + 5 = 9, which is 3 squared. Yep, it works for n=2 and n=3 as well. So, that gives me more confidence in the proof.\n\nI think I've covered all the necessary steps. The base case is verified, the inductive hypothesis is assumed, the next step is proven by adding the next term and simplifying, and it matches the expansion of (k + 1) squared. Plus, testing with specific numbers confirms the validity. So, I'm confident that this proof by induction is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo prove by mathematical induction that the sum of the first \\( n \\) odd positive integers equals \\( n^2 \\), we proceed as follows:\n\n**Base Case (\\( n = 1 \\)):**\nThe sum of the first 1 odd positive integer is \\( 1 \\). According to the formula, \\( 1^2 = 1 \\).

In other words, prove that 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2n-1) = n\u00b2 for all positive integers n. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this problem to prove by mathematical induction that the sum of the first n odd positive integers equals n squared. That is, I need to show that 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2n - 1) = n\u00b2 for all positive integers n. Hmm, induction... Okay, let me recall how mathematical induction works. It's a two-step process: first, you prove the base case, usually for n = 1. Then, you assume it's true for some arbitrary positive integer k, and then you prove it for k + 1. If both steps hold, then by induction, the statement is true for all positive integers n.\n\nSo, starting with the base case, n = 1. Let's plug in n = 1 into the left side of the equation: 1. And the right side is 1\u00b2, which is also 1. So, 1 = 1, which is true. That means the base case holds. Cool, that wasn't too bad.\n\nNow, onto the inductive step. I need to assume that the statement is true for some arbitrary positive integer k. That is, I'll assume that 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k - 1) = k\u00b2. This is my induction hypothesis. So, I'm assuming that the sum up to the kth odd number is k squared.\n\nNow, I need to show that if this is true for k, then it must also be true for k + 1. In other words, I need to show that 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k - 1) + (2(k + 1) - 1) = (k + 1)\u00b2. Let me write that down.\n\nStarting from the left side, the sum up to (2k - 1) is equal to k\u00b2 by the induction hypothesis. Then, adding the next odd number, which is 2(k + 1) - 1. Let me compute that: 2(k + 1) is 2k + 2, so subtracting 1 gives 2k + 1. So, the next odd number is 2k + 1.\n\nTherefore, the sum up to (2(k + 1) - 1) is k\u00b2 + (2k + 1). So, that's k\u00b2 + 2k + 1. Hmm, can I factor that? Let me see, k\u00b2 + 2k + 1 is a perfect square, right? It's equal to (k + 1)\u00b2 because (k + 1)\u00b2 = k\u00b2 + 2k + 1.\n\nSo, that means the sum up to (2(k + 1) - 1) is equal to (k + 1)\u00b2. Which is exactly what we needed to prove for the inductive step.\n\nTherefore, since the base case holds and the inductive step holds, by mathematical induction, the statement is true for all positive integers n. So, 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2n - 1) equals n squared for all positive integers n.\n\nWait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting with the base case, n = 1: 1 = 1\u00b2, which is correct. Then, assuming it's true for n = k: sum is k\u00b2. Then, for n = k + 1, adding the next odd number, which is 2k + 1. Adding that to k\u00b2 gives k\u00b2 + 2k + 1, which factors to (k + 1)\u00b2. That seems right.\n\nIs there another way to think about this? Maybe visualizing the sum. Each odd number is 2 apart, so the sequence is 1, 3, 5, ..., (2n - 1). The sum is n\u00b2. I remember that the sum of the first n odd numbers is a square number. For example, 1 = 1\u00b2, 1 + 3 = 4 = 2\u00b2, 1 + 3 + 5 = 9 = 3\u00b2, and so on. So, this makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about it in terms of arithmetic series. The first term a1 is 1, the last term an is (2n - 1), and the number of terms is n. The sum of an arithmetic series is (number of terms)/2 times (first term + last term). So, plugging in, the sum S = n/2 * (1 + (2n - 1)) = n/2 * (2n) = n\u00b2. That's another way to see it without induction.\n\nBut since the problem specifically asks for induction, I should stick to that method. So, to recap: base case holds, inductive step holds, therefore by induction, the statement is true for all positive integers n.\n\nI think that covers it. I don't see any gaps in the logic. The key was realizing that adding the next odd number to the sum up to k gives a perfect square, specifically (k + 1)\u00b2, which completes the inductive step.\n</think>\n\nAlright, so let's go through the proof step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Base Case**\n\nFirst, we verify the statement for the initial value, \\( n = 1 \\).\n\nLeft side: \\( 1 \\)\n\nRight side: \\( 1^2 = 1 \\)\n\nSince both sides are equal, the base case holds.\n\n**Step 2: Inductive Hypothesis**\n\nAssume that the statement is true for some arbitrary positive integer \\( k \\). That is, assume:\n\n\\[ 1 + 3 + 5 + \\ldots + (2k - 1) = k^2 \\]\n\n**Step 3: Inductive Step**\n\nWe need to show that the statement holds for \\( k + 1 \\), i.e.,\n\n\\[ 1 + 3 + 5 + \\ldots + (2k - 1) + (2(k + 1) - 1) = (k + 1)^2 \\]\n\nStarting with the left side, we use the inductive hypothesis:\n\n\\[ 1 + 3 + 5 + \\ldots + (2k - 1) + (2k + 1) \\]\n\nSubstituting the inductive hypothesis:\n\n\\[ k^2 + (2k + 1) \\]\n\nSimplify the expression:\n\n\\[ k^2 + 2k + 1 \\]\n\nFactor the quadratic expression:\n\n\\[ (k + 1)^2 \\]\n\nThus, the left side equals the right side:\n\n\\[ (k + 1)^2 \\]\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\n\nSince the base case holds and the inductive step has been proven, by mathematical induction, the statement is true for all positive integers \\( n \\).\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nFor all positive integers \\( n \\), the sum of the first \\( n \\) odd positive integers is \\( n^2 \\).

Hmm, okay, induction is a method where I prove the base case and then show that if it holds for some integer k, it holds for k+1. Let me start by recalling the formula I need to prove: 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2n - 1) = n\u00b2 for all positive integers n.\n\nFirst, I'll check the base case when n = 1. Plugging in n=1, the left side is just 1, and the right side is 1\u00b2, which is also 1. So the base case holds. That\u2019s straightforward.\n\nNow, for the induction step. I need to assume that the formula holds for some arbitrary positive integer k, meaning that 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k - 1) = k\u00b2. Then, I have to show that it also holds for k + 1, that is, 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k - 1) + (2(k+1) - 1) = (k + 1)\u00b2.\n\nWait, let me make sure I understand the induction step correctly. If I assume the sum up to k is k\u00b2, then adding the next odd number, which would be 2(k+1) - 1, which simplifies to 2k + 1, right? So the sum up to k+1 would be k\u00b2 + (2k + 1). I need to show that this equals (k + 1)\u00b2.\n\nLet me compute (k + 1)\u00b2. That's k\u00b2 + 2k + 1. So, k\u00b2 + (2k + 1) is equal to k\u00b2 + 2k + 1, which is exactly (k + 1)\u00b2. Therefore, the sum up to k+1 is indeed (k + 1)\u00b2. So the induction step holds.\n\nWait, did I do that correctly? Let me double-check. If I have the sum up to k as k\u00b2, then adding the next odd number, which is 2(k+1)-1, which is 2k+1, gives k\u00b2 + 2k +1. And (k +1)\u00b2 is also k\u00b2 + 2k +1. So yes, that seems right.\n\nBut wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the induction step. Let me think again. When I'm adding the next term, which is 2(k+1) -1, that's correct, but maybe I should consider how the sum is structured. The sum up to k+1 is the sum up to k plus the next term. So, 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k -1) + (2(k+1) -1). That's the same as k\u00b2 + (2k +1). And k\u00b2 + 2k +1 is (k+1)\u00b2. So yes, that's correct.\n\nI think that's solid. Therefore, by mathematical induction, the formula holds for all positive integers n. The base case works, and the induction step holds. So the proof is complete.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Sometimes in induction, especially with sums, it's easy to miscount the terms or misapply the formula. Let me test with a small value, say n=2. The sum should be 1 + 3 = 4, which is 2\u00b2. Using my induction step, when k=1, sum is 1, then for k=2, sum is 1 + 3 =4, which is 2\u00b2. That works.\n\nAnother test: n=3. Sum is 1+3+5=9, which is 3\u00b2. Using the induction step, when k=2, sum is 4, then adding 5 gives 9, which is (2+1)\u00b2. So that works too.\n\nOkay, I think I've got it right. The induction step correctly shows that if the sum up to k is k\u00b2, then the sum up to k+1 is (k+1)\u00b2. Therefore, by induction, the formula holds for all positive integers n.\n</think>\n\nNow, let's provide a clear step-by-step explanation and proof using mathematical induction.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation and Proof:**\n\nWe aim to prove that for all positive integers \\( n \\), the sum of the first \\( n \\) odd positive integers equals \\( n^2 \\).

In other words, prove that 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2n-1) = n\u00b2 for all positive integers n. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I need to prove by mathematical induction that the sum of the first n odd positive integers equals n squared. That is, 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2n - 1) = n\u00b2 for all positive integers n. Hmm, okay. Let me try to recall how mathematical induction works. It's been a while since I did one of these.\n\nFirst, I think induction has two main steps: the base case and the inductive step. The base case is usually proving the statement for the initial value, often n = 1. Then, the inductive step assumes it's true for some arbitrary positive integer k and then proves it for k + 1. If both steps are successful, then by induction, the statement holds for all positive integers n.\n\nSo, starting with the base case. Let's set n = 1. The sum of the first 1 odd positive integer is just 1. On the other hand, n\u00b2 when n=1 is 1\u00b2 = 1. So, 1 = 1, which checks out. Base case is done, I think.\n\nNow, moving on to the inductive step. Let's assume that the statement is true for some arbitrary positive integer k. That is, assume that 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k - 1) = k\u00b2. This is my induction hypothesis. Now, I need to show that if this is true, then the statement also holds for k + 1, meaning that 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k - 1) + (2(k + 1) - 1) = (k + 1)\u00b2.\n\nWait, let me write that out more clearly. If I have the sum up to the kth term, which is k\u00b2, then adding the next odd number, which would be 2(k + 1) - 1. Let's compute that: 2(k + 1) - 1 = 2k + 2 - 1 = 2k + 1. So, the sum up to k + 1 terms would be k\u00b2 + (2k + 1). I need to show that this equals (k + 1)\u00b2.\n\nSo, let's compute (k + 1)\u00b2. That's k\u00b2 + 2k + 1. Comparing this with the sum we have, which is k\u00b2 + 2k + 1, they are the same. Therefore, the sum up to k + 1 terms is indeed (k + 1)\u00b2. Therefore, by induction, the statement holds for all positive integers n.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward, but maybe I should double-check. Let me try with a small value of k to see if it holds. Let's take k = 2. The sum of the first 2 odd integers is 1 + 3 = 4, which is 2\u00b2. Now, according to the inductive step, if it holds for k = 2, it should hold for k = 3. The sum up to k = 2 is 4, and adding the next odd number, which is 5, gives 4 + 5 = 9, which is 3\u00b2. That works. Let me try k = 3. The sum is 1 + 3 + 5 = 9, which is 3\u00b2. Adding the next odd number, 7, gives 9 + 7 = 16, which is 4\u00b2. Yeah, that's correct.\n\nSo, it seems like the inductive step works because adding the next odd number increases the sum by an additional 2k + 1, which is exactly the same as (k + 1)\u00b2 - k\u00b2. Let me compute that difference: (k + 1)\u00b2 - k\u00b2 = (k\u00b2 + 2k + 1) - k\u00b2 = 2k + 1. Yep, that matches. So, the inductive step holds.\n\nTherefore, by mathematical induction, the sum of the first n odd positive integers is equal to n squared for all positive integers n. I think that covers it. Maybe I should write it out more formally to make sure I haven't missed anything.\n\nWait, another thought: sometimes, in induction, people make mistakes in either the base case or the inductive step. Let me ensure both are solid. The base case was n = 1, which works. The inductive step assumed it's true for k, and then showed it's true for k + 1. I think that's correct. Also, the formula for the sum of the first n odd integers is a known formula, which is n\u00b2. So, this proof aligns with that known result.\n\nAlright, I think I'm confident in this proof. It seems to hold for the base case, and the inductive step works as needed.
