  "question": "A weather forecast indicates a 30% chance of rain tomorrow. You are planning a picnic, and if it rains, you will lose $50 in non-refundable supplies. Alternatively, you can host an indoor gathering, which would cost an additional $20 to rent a space, but this option is not affected by weather. Should you plan the picnic or the indoor gathering to minimize your expected cost? Show your reasoning using expected value calculations.",
  "answer": "This problem requires calculating the expected cost of each option and choosing the one with the lower expected cost.\n\n1. For the picnic option:\n   - If it rains (30% probability): You lose $50\n   - If it doesn't rain (70% probability): You lose $0\n   - Expected cost = 0.3 \u00d7 $50 + 0.7 \u00d7 $0 = $15\n\n2. For the indoor gathering option:\n   - You pay $20 extra regardless of weather\n   - Expected cost = $20\n\n3. Comparing the two options:\n   - Picnic expected cost: $15\n   - Indoor gathering expected cost: $20\n\n4. Decision: Since the expected cost of the picnic ($15) is less than the expected cost of the indoor gathering ($20), you should choose to plan the picnic to minimize your expected cost.\n\nThis solution demonstrates how to use probability and expected value to make decisions under uncertainty, even when there is a risk of a worse outcome."
