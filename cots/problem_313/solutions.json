You are planning a picnic, and if it rains, you will lose $50 in non-refundable supplies. Alternatively, you can host an indoor gathering, which would cost an additional $20 to rent a space, but this option is not affected by weather. Should you plan the picnic or the indoor gathering to minimize your expected cost? Show your reasoning using expected value calculations. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to decide whether to plan a picnic or an indoor gathering for my picnic tomorrow. The weather forecast says there's a 30% chance of rain, and if it rains, I lose $50 in non-refundable supplies. If I go with the indoor gathering, I have to pay an extra $20 to rent a space, but the weather doesn't affect it. I need to figure out which option is better financially. \n\nOkay, first, let's break down the costs for each option. If I choose the picnic, the only variable cost is the $50 loss if it rains. The $50 is non-refundable, so if it doesn't rain, I don't lose anything. If I choose the indoor gathering, I have a fixed cost of $20 regardless of the weather. \n\nSo, for the picnic, I need to calculate the expected cost. Expected value is like the average outcome we can expect if we were to repeat this scenario many times. It's calculated by multiplying each outcome by its probability and then summing those up. \n\nIn this case, there are two outcomes for the picnic: it rains or it doesn't rain. The probability of rain is 30%, or 0.3, and the probability of no rain is 70%, or 0.7. \n\nIf it rains, my cost is $50. If it doesn't rain, my cost is $0. So, the expected cost for the picnic would be:\n\nExpected Cost (Picnic) = (Probability of Rain * Cost if Rain) + (Probability of No Rain * Cost if No Rain)\nExpected Cost (Picnic) = (0.3 * $50) + (0.7 * $0)\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n0.3 * 50 = $15\n0.7 * 0 = $0\nSo, Expected Cost (Picnic) = $15 + $0 = $15\n\nOkay, so on average, planning a picnic would cost me $15. \n\nNow, for the indoor gathering, the cost is fixed at $20, regardless of the weather. So, the expected cost here is just $20 because there's no uncertainty involved. \n\nSo, comparing the two:\n- Picnic: Expected cost $15\n- Indoor Gathering: Expected cost $20\n\nSince $15 is less than $20, the picnic seems like the cheaper option on average. Therefore, I should plan the picnic to minimize my expected cost. \n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. The picnic has a 30% chance of losing $50, which is a pretty high chance, but the loss is also a significant amount. The expected value is $15, which is lower than the fixed $20 for the indoor gathering. So yeah, the picnic is better in this case because even though there's a chance of losing money, the average cost is lower than the guaranteed $20.\n</think>\n\nTo determine which option is more cost-effective, we'll calculate the expected cost for both scenarios.\n\n**Picnic:**\n- Probability of Rain = 30% (0.3)\n- Cost if it rains = $50\n- Probability of No Rain = 70% (0.7)\n- Cost if it doesn't rain = $0\n\nExpected Cost (Picnic) = (0.3 * $50) + (0.7 * $0) = $15 + $0 = $15\n\n**Indoor Gathering:**\n- Fixed Cost = $20\n- No dependency on weather\n\nExpected Cost (Indoor) = $20\n\n**Comparison:**\n- Picnic: Expected Cost = $15\n- Indoor Gathering: Expected Cost = $20\n\n**Conclusion:**\nSince the expected cost of the picnic ($15) is less than that of the indoor gathering ($20), you should plan the picnic to minimize your expected cost.\n\nDONE."

Should you plan the picnic or the indoor gathering to minimize your expected cost? Show your reasoning using expected value calculations. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether I should plan a picnic or an indoor gathering for my picnic tomorrow. The weather forecast says there's a 30% chance of rain, and if it rains, I'll lose $50 in non-refundable supplies. If I go with the indoor gathering, I have to pay an extra $20 to rent a space, but that's it\u2014it's not affected by the weather. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the costs involved in each option. For the picnic, the main uncertainty is the rain. There's a 30% chance it will rain, costing me $50, and a 70% chance it won't rain, so I don't lose any money. On the other hand, the indoor gathering is a sure thing in terms of cost\u2014it's going to cost me $20 regardless of the weather. \n\nI think I should calculate the expected cost for both options to see which one is cheaper on average. Expected value is a way to calculate the average outcome if we were to repeat the scenario many times. It's done by multiplying each outcome by its probability and then summing those values.\n\nFor the picnic, the expected cost would be the cost if it rains multiplied by the probability of rain plus the cost if it doesn't rain multiplied by the probability of no rain. So that would be:\n\nExpected Cost (Picnic) = ($50 * 0.30) + ($0 * 0.70)\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n$50 * 0.30 = $15\n$0 * 0.70 = $0\nSo, Expected Cost (Picnic) = $15 + $0 = $15\n\nHmm, so on average, the picnic would cost me $15. But wait, is that the correct way to look at it? Because if it rains, I lose $50, but if it doesn't, I don't lose anything. So the expected loss is $15, which is the average loss I'd expect over many days.\n\nNow, for the indoor gathering, the expected cost is straightforward since there's no uncertainty. It's just the fixed cost of $20.\n\nExpected Cost (Indoor) = $20\n\nComparing the two expected costs, the picnic has an expected cost of $15, while the indoor gathering costs $20. So, on average, the picnic seems cheaper. But I want to double-check my reasoning because sometimes intuition can be tricky.\n\nWait, let me think again. If I go to the picnic, there's a 30% chance of losing $50, which is a significant amount. So, on days when it rains, which happens 30% of the time, I'm out $50, but on the other 70% of days, I don't lose anything. So, over time, the average loss per picnic is $15. But does that mean the expected cost is $15, or is the $50 a loss, so it's negative? Hmm, maybe I should frame it as a loss rather than a cost.\n\nIf I think of the picnic as having a potential loss, then the expected loss is $15, which is better than the guaranteed $20 cost of the indoor gathering. So, from a purely financial standpoint, the picnic has a lower expected cost.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider the total cost, including the possible loss, the picnic has a 70% chance of costing $0 and a 30% chance of costing $50. So, the expected total cost would be:\n\nExpected Total Cost (Picnic) = ($0 * 0.70) + ($50 * 0.30) = $15\n\nAnd the indoor gathering is a sure $20.\n\nComparing $15 to $20, the picnic is still cheaper on average. Therefore, I should plan the picnic because it has a lower expected cost, even though there's a risk of losing $50 if it rains. The lower expected cost outweighs the potential loss in this case.\n\nI guess another way to look at it is to see how much more expensive the indoor gathering is compared to the picnic. The difference in expected costs is $5 ($20 - $15). So, I'm saving an average of $5 by choosing the picnic over the indoor gathering, despite the 30% chance of losing $50.\n\nBut wait, is $15 the correct expected cost? Let me confirm:\n\n- 30% chance of rain: cost = $50\n- 70% chance of no rain: cost = $0\n\nSo, Expected Cost = (0.30 * 50) + (0.70 * 0) = 15 + 0 = $15\n\nYes, that's correct. So, the expected cost is indeed $15 for the picnic and $20 for the indoor gathering. Therefore, the picnic is the better option financially.\n\nI think I've thought this through thoroughly. The key is to calculate the expected values for both options and compare them. Since the picnic has a lower expected cost, it's the optimal choice.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether to plan a picnic or an indoor gathering, we calculate the expected cost for each option.\n\n**Picnic:**\n- 30% chance of rain: Cost = $50\n- 70% chance of no rain: Cost = $0\n- Expected Cost = (0.30 * $50) + (0.70 * $0) = $15\n\n**Indoor Gathering:**\n- Cost = $20 (guaranteed)\n\nComparing the expected costs:\n- Picnic: $15\n- Indoor Gathering: $20\n\nThe picnic has a lower expected cost, making it the optimal choice.\n\nDONE."

Mathematically, that would be:\n\nExpected Cost (Picnic) = ($50 * 0.3) + ($0 * 0.7) = $15 + $0 = $15\n\nWait, that seems a bit off. If there's a 30% chance of rain, the expected loss is 30% of $50, which is indeed $15. So the expected cost for the picnic is $15.\n\nNow, for the indoor gathering:\n- There's no uncertainty because the weather doesn't affect it.\n- I have to pay an additional $20 regardless of the weather.\n\nSo, the expected cost for the indoor gathering is straightforward:\n\nExpected Cost (Indoor) = $20 * 1 = $20\n\nComparing both expected costs:\n- Picnic: $15\n- Indoor: $20\n\nSince $15 is less than $20, it seems like the picnic has a lower expected cost.

If it rains, I lose $50. If it doesn't rain, I don't lose anything. The probability of rain is 30%, so no rain would be 70% because those are the only two possibilities.\n\nSo, the expected cost for the picnic would be the cost if it rains plus the cost if it doesn't rain, each multiplied by their respective probabilities. That would be:\n\nExpected Cost (Picnic) = ($50 * 0.30) + ($0 * 0.70)\n\nCalculating that, 0.30 times $50 is $15, and 0.70 times $0 is $0. So, the expected cost for the picnic is $15.\n\nNow, let's look at the indoor gathering option. This one seems straightforward because the weather doesn't affect it. Regardless of whether it rains or not, I have to pay $20 to rent the space. So, the expected cost here is just:\n\nExpected Cost (Indoor) = $20 * 1.00 = $20\n\nComparing the two expected costs, the picnic has an expected cost of $15, while the indoor gathering has an expected cost of $20. Since $15 is less than $20, it makes sense to choose the picnic to minimize my expected cost.\n\nWait a second, I should double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. For the picnic, 30% chance of rain times $50 loss is indeed $15, and 70% chance of no loss is $0, totaling $15.

Expected value is like the average outcome we can expect, so it'll help me decide which plan is better financially.\n\nStarting with the picnic. If it rains, I lose $50. If it doesn't rain, I don't lose anything. The probability of rain is 30%, so that's 0.3, and the probability of no rain is 70%, which is 0.7. So, the expected cost for the picnic would be the cost of rain times the probability of rain plus the cost of no rain times the probability of no rain. \n\nMathematically, that would be: Expected Cost (Picnic) = (Cost if Rain * Probability of Rain) + (Cost if No Rain * Probability of No Rain). Plugging in the numbers, it's (50 * 0.3) + (0 * 0.7). So, 15 + 0 equals $15. So, on average, I expect to lose $15 if I go with the picnic.\n\nNow, let's look at the indoor gathering. The cost is a flat $20 regardless of the weather. So, the expected cost here is straightforward. It's just $20 all the time. So, Expected Cost (Indoor) = $20.\n\nComparing the two, the picnic has an expected cost of $15, and the indoor gathering costs $20.

On the other hand, if I go with an indoor gathering, it costs an additional $20 to rent a space, but this option isn't affected by the weather. So, I need to compare the expected costs of both options and decide which one is cheaper on average.\n\nLet me start by understanding what expected value means. The expected value is like the average outcome we can expect if we repeat an action many times. So, in this case, I'll calculate the expected cost for both the picnic and the indoor gathering and see which one is lower.\n\nFor the picnic, there are two possible scenarios: it rains or it doesn't rain. The probability of rain is 30%, which is 0.3 in decimal form, and the probability of no rain is 70%, or 0.7.\n\nIf it rains, the cost is $50. If it doesn't rain, I don't lose any money, so the cost is $0.

There's no uncertainty here because it's not affected by the weather. It costs an additional $20 to rent a space, so regardless of the weather, the cost is $20. Therefore, the expected cost for the indoor gathering (E_i) is straightforward.\n\nE_i = $20\n\nComparing both expected costs:\n- Picnic: $15\n- Indoor gathering: $20\n\nSince $15 is less than $20, the picnic has a lower expected cost.

So, the picnic is the better option.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether to plan a picnic or an indoor gathering, we calculate the expected cost for each option using the given probabilities and costs.\n\n**Picnic Expected Cost:**\n- Probability of Rain (P(Rain)) = 0.3\n- Cost if it rains (C(Rain)) = $50\n- Probability of No Rain (P(No Rain)) = 0.7\n- Cost if it doesn't rain (C(No Rain)) = $0\n\nExpected Cost (E_p) = P(Rain) * C(Rain) + P(No Rain) * C(No Rain)\nE_p = 0.3 * 50 + 0.7 * 0 = $15 + $0 = $15\n\n**Indoor Gathering Expected Cost:**\n- Cost (C) = $20 (flat rate, unaffected by weather)\n\nExpected Cost (E_i) = $20\n\n**Comparison:**\n- E_p = $15\n- E_i = $20\n\nSince $15 < $20, the picnic has a lower expected cost.\n\n**Decision:**\nPlan the picnic to minimize the expected cost.\n\nDONE."

On the other hand, if I go indoors, I have to pay an extra $20 to rent a space, but that's it\u2014no other costs or issues. I need to figure out which option is better financially to minimize my expected cost. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the probabilities and the associated costs. The weather forecast gives a 30% chance of rain. That means there's a 70% chance it won't rain. So, I have two scenarios to consider: one where it rains and another where it doesn't.\n\nIf it rains, I lose $50. That's straightforward. But if it doesn't rain, I can have the picnic without any loss, right? However, if I choose the indoor gathering, regardless of the weather, I have to pay an extra $20. So, whether it rains or not, I'll have to spend $20 more for the indoor setup. But wait, if it rains, I also lose the $50. So, in that case, my total cost would be $20 (for the indoor setup) plus $50 (the lost supplies), totaling $70. On the other hand, if it doesn't rain, I only have to pay the extra $20 for the indoor gathering, no loss of supplies.\n\nLet me write this down to visualize it better:\n\n- **Picnic:**\n  - Probability of Rain (P(Rain)) = 30% = 0.3\n  - Cost if it rains: $50\n  - Probability of No Rain (P(No Rain)) = 70% = 0.7\n  - Cost if it doesn't rain: $0 (since I can have the picnic without any extra cost)\n\n- **Indoor Gathering:**\n  - Regardless of weather, cost is $20\n  - So, both when it rains and when it doesn't, I pay $20\n\nNow, to calculate the expected cost for each option, I need to multiply the probability of each scenario by the corresponding cost and then sum them up.\n\nLet's start with the picnic:\n\nExpected Cost for Picnic = (Probability of Rain * Cost if it rains) + (Probability of No Rain * Cost if it doesn't rain)\n= (0.3 * $50) + (0.7 * $0)\n= $15 + $0\n= $15\n\nSo, the expected cost for the picnic is $15.\n\nNow, for the indoor gathering:\n\nSince the cost is fixed at $20 regardless of the weather, the expected cost is straightforward:\n\nExpected Cost for Indoor Gathering = $20\n\nComparing both, the picnic has an expected cost of $15, while the indoor gathering costs $20. Therefore, the picnic is the cheaper option with a lower expected cost.\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. If it rains, I lose $50, but I can still have the picnic, so maybe I don't have to pay for the indoor gathering in that case? Hmm, actually, no. The problem says that if I choose the indoor gathering, it costs an additional $20, but if I choose the picnic, it's free unless it rains, in which case I lose the supplies. So, I think my initial calculation is correct.\n\nBut just to clarify, if I choose the picnic, and it rains, I lose $50. If I choose the indoor gathering, I pay $20 regardless. So, the expected cost for the picnic is the probability of rain times the loss plus the probability of no rain times zero. That's $15, as I calculated. The indoor gathering is a sure $20 cost. Therefore, the picnic is better because $15 is less than $20.\n\nI think that's solid. No mistakes noticed here.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether to plan a picnic or an indoor gathering, we'll calculate the expected cost for each option using the given probabilities and costs.\n\n**Picnic:**\n- **Probability of Rain (P(Rain))**: 30% or 0.3\n- **Cost if it rains**: $50\n- **Probability of No Rain (P(No Rain))**: 70% or 0.7\n- **Cost if it doesn't rain**: $0\n\n**Expected Cost for Picnic**:\n\\[\n\\text{Expected Cost} = (0.3 \\times \\$50) + (0.7 \\times \\$0) = \\$15 + \\$0 = \\$15\n\\]\n\n**Indoor Gathering:**\n- **Cost**: $20 (fixed, regardless of weather)\n\n**Expected Cost for Indoor Gathering**: \\$20\n\n**Comparison**:\n- **Picnic Expected Cost**: \\$15\n- **Indoor Gathering Expected Cost**: \\$20\n\n**Conclusion**: Planning the picnic results in a lower expected cost of \\$15 compared to the indoor gathering's \\$20. Therefore, you should plan the picnic to minimize your expected cost.\n\nDONE."

Show your reasoning using expected value calculations. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether I should plan a picnic or an indoor gathering for my picnic tomorrow. The weather forecast says there's a 30% chance of rain, and if it rains, I'll lose $50 in non-refundable supplies. If I go with the indoor gathering, it'll cost an extra $20 to rent a space, but the weather won't affect that option. I guess I need to calculate the expected costs for both options and see which one is cheaper on average.\n\nFirst, let me break it down. For the picnic option, there are two possible outcomes: it rains or it doesn't. The probability of rain is 30%, so the probability of no rain would be 70%, right? If it rains, I lose $50. If it doesn't rain, I don't lose anything, so that's a cost of $0.\n\nSo, for the picnic, the expected cost would be the probability of rain times the cost of losing supplies plus the probability of no rain times the cost of no supplies. Let me write that out:\n\nExpected cost for picnic = (0.30 * $50) + (0.70 * $0)\n\nCalculating that: 0.30 * 50 = $15, and 0.70 * 0 = $0. So the expected cost is $15.\n\nNow, for the indoor gathering, there's no mention of any weather-related costs. It just says it's an additional $20 to rent a space, and it's not affected by the weather. So, regardless of whether it rains or not, I have to pay $20. Therefore, the expected cost for the indoor gathering is straightforward:\n\nExpected cost for indoor gathering = $20\n\nComparing the two expected costs: picnic is $15 and indoor gathering is $20. Since $15 is less than $20, it makes sense to plan the picnic because the expected cost is lower. Even though there's a 30% chance of losing $50, the lower probability makes the overall expected loss less than the fixed cost of the indoor gathering.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations. For the picnic, 30% of $50 is indeed $15, and 70% of $0 is $0. So, $15 total expected cost. For the indoor, it's a flat $20. Yep, $15 is less than $20, so picnic is better.\n\nI think that's it. The expected cost for the picnic is lower, so I should go with that.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether to plan a picnic or an indoor gathering, we'll calculate the expected cost for each option.\n\n**Picnic Expected Cost:**\n- Probability of Rain = 30% = 0.30\n- Cost if it rains = $50\n- Probability of No Rain = 70% = 0.70\n- Cost if it doesn't rain = $0\n\nExpected Cost (Picnic) = (0.30 * $50) + (0.70 * $0) = $15 + $0 = $15\n\n**Indoor Gathering Expected Cost:**\n- Cost = $20 (fixed, regardless of weather)\n\nExpected Cost (Indoor Gathering) = $20\n\n**Comparison:**\n- Picnic: $15\n- Indoor Gathering: $20\n\n**Decision:**\nPlan the picnic as it has a lower expected cost of $15 compared to $20 for the indoor gathering.\n\nDONE."

Show your reasoning using expected value calculations. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether to plan a picnic or an indoor gathering for my picnic tomorrow, considering the weather forecast. The forecast says there's a 30% chance of rain, and if it rains, I lose $50 in non-refundable supplies. If I host an indoor gathering instead, I have to pay an extra $20 to rent a space, but that's not affected by the weather. I want to minimize my expected cost, so I need to calculate the expected costs for both options and see which one is cheaper.\n\nFirst, let's break down the problem. There are two possible scenarios: rain or no rain. Each scenario has its own cost associated with it, and I need to calculate the expected cost for each option.\n\nStarting with the picnic option. If it rains, I lose $50, and if it doesn't rain, I don't lose anything. The probability of rain is 30%, or 0.3, and no rain is 70%, or 0.7. So, the expected cost for the picnic would be the cost if it rains plus the cost if it doesn't rain, multiplied by their respective probabilities.\n\nMathematically, that would be:\nExpected Cost of Picnic = (Cost if Rain * Probability of Rain) + (Cost if No Rain * Probability of No Rain)\nPlugging in the numbers:\nExpected Cost of Picnic = ($50 * 0.3) + ($0 * 0.7)\nCalculating that:\n$50 * 0.3 = $15\n$0 * 0.7 = $0\nAdding them together: $15 + $0 = $15\nSo, the expected cost of the picnic is $15.\n\nNow, moving on to the indoor gathering option. There's a fixed cost of $20 to rent the space, regardless of the weather. So, whether it rains or not, I have to pay $20. There's no additional cost based on the weather for this option. Therefore, the expected cost for the indoor gathering is just the fixed cost.\n\nExpected Cost of Indoor Gathering = $20\n\nComparing the two expected costs:\nPicnic: $15\nIndoor Gathering: $20\n\nSince $15 is less than $20, the picnic has a lower expected cost. Therefore, I should plan the picnic to minimize my expected cost.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. For the picnic, 30% chance of rain leading to a $50 loss, and 70% chance of no rain with no loss. So, 0.3*50 + 0.7*0 = 15 + 0 = $15. That seems correct. For the indoor gathering, it's a flat $20 regardless of the weather. So, yes, $15 is indeed less than $20. Therefore, the picnic is the better option.\n\nI think that's all. I don't see any other factors I need to consider, like other costs or benefits. The problem only mentions the $50 loss for the picnic and the $20 fixed cost for the indoor gathering. So, based on expected value, the picnic is cheaper on average.\n</think>\n\nTo determine whether to plan a picnic or an indoor gathering, let's calculate the expected cost for each option.\n\n**Picnic:**\n- **Cost if it rains:** $50\n- **Probability of rain:** 30% (0.3)\n- **Cost if it doesn't rain:** $0\n- **Probability of no rain:** 70% (0.7)\n\n**Expected Cost of Picnic:**\n\\[\n(0.3 \\times \\$50) + (0.7 \\times \\$0) = \\$15 + \\$0 = \\$15\n\\]\n\n**Indoor Gathering:**\n- **Cost:** \\$20 (fixed, regardless of weather)\n\n**Expected Cost of Indoor Gathering:**\n\\[\n\\$20\n\\]\n\n**Comparison:**\n- **Picnic:** \\$15\n- **Indoor Gathering:** \\$20\n\nSince \\$15 is less than \\$20, the picnic has a lower expected cost. Therefore, you should plan the picnic to minimize your expected cost.\n\nDONE."
