  "question": "In a group of 15 people, some pairs are friends on a social media platform. If each person has at least 10 friends in the group, prove that there must exist at least one set of 3 people who are all friends with each other (forming a 'friendship triangle').",
  "answer": "To solve this problem, we'll use the Pigeonhole Principle to analyze potential friendship patterns.\n\nStep 1: For any person A in the group, they have at least 10 friends among the other 14 people.\n\nStep 2: Let's consider any person A and the set S of their friends. By the given condition, S contains at least 10 people.\n\nStep 3: Now, we'll analyze the possible friendship relationships between members of set S. For any two people B and C in set S, they can either be friends or not friends with each other.\n\nStep 4: Let's count the maximum number of pairs in set S that might NOT be friends. If there are no 'friendship triangles' involving A, then none of A's friends can be friends with each other. This means all pairs of people in set S would not be friends.\n\nStep 5: The number of possible pairs among 10 people is (10 \u00d7 9)/2 = 45 pairs.\n\nStep 6: However, each person in set S has at least 10 friends in the entire group. Since they are already friends with A, they must have at least 9 other friends.\n\nStep 7: This means each person in set S has at least 9 friends among the 14 people in the group excluding themselves. At least some of these friends must be within set S.\n\nStep 8: Let's count the minimum total number of friendships that must exist among people in set S. Each person in S has at least 9 other friends, and there are 10 people in S, giving a total of (10 \u00d7 9)/2 = 45 friendship pairs if we count each friendship once.\n\nStep 9: Since the maximum number of pairs that might NOT be friends is 45, and we've shown there must be at least 45 friendship pairs, by the Pigeonhole Principle, at least some pairs in set S must be friends with each other.\n\nStep 10: In fact, if every person in S has at least 9 friends among the other 14 people, and some of those friends must be in S (since there are only 4 people outside S), then there must be at least one pair of people B and C in S who are friends with each other.\n\nStep 11: Since A is friends with both B and C, and B and C are friends with each other, we have found a 'friendship triangle' consisting of A, B, and C.\n\nTherefore, by the Pigeonhole Principle, there must exist at least one set of 3 people who are all friends with each other, forming a friendship triangle."
