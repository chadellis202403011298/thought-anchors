If each person has at least 10 friends in the group, prove that there must exist at least one set of 3 people who are all friends with each other (forming a 'friendship triangle'). \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I've got this problem here about a group of 15 people on a social media platform. The condition is that each person has at least 10 friends within this group. I need to prove that there must be at least one set of three people who are all friends with each other, forming what's called a 'friendship triangle'. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I think I should model this situation using graph theory. I remember that in graph theory, each person can be represented as a vertex, and each friendship as an edge connecting two vertices. So, if we have 15 people, the graph will have 15 vertices. The problem states that each person has at least 10 friends, which translates to each vertex having a degree of at least 10. Degree here refers to the number of edges connected to a vertex.\n\nSo, we have a graph with 15 vertices, each of degree at least 10. Now, the goal is to show that there must be at least one triangle, which is a set of three vertices where each pair is connected by an edge. In other words, a triangle is a set of three mutual friends.\n\nI recall something about graph theory called Tur\u00e1n's theorem, which gives the maximum number of edges a graph can have without containing a complete subgraph of a certain size. For triangles, which are complete subgraphs of size 3, Tur\u00e1n's theorem might be useful here. Let me try to remember what Tur\u00e1n's theorem states.\n\nTur\u00e1n's theorem says that for a graph to not contain a (r+1)-clique, the maximum number of edges it can have is given by the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Tur\u00e1n number } T(n, r) = \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{r}\\right) \\frac{n^2}{2} \\]\n\nIn our case, we're dealing with triangles, which are 3-cliques. So, r would be 2 because we're looking to avoid a 3-clique. Plugging that into the formula:\n\n\\[ T(15, 2) = \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\frac{15^2}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{225}{2} = \\frac{225}{4} = 56.25 \\]\n\nWait, but the number of edges must be an integer, so the maximum number of edges without a triangle is 56. So, if our graph has more than 56 edges, it must contain at least one triangle.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of edges in our graph. Each of the 15 people has at least 10 friends, so each vertex has a degree of at least 10. The sum of all degrees in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges, so:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total degree} = 15 \\times 10 = 150 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Number of edges} = \\frac{150}{2} = 75 \\]\n\nSo, our graph has 75 edges. Comparing this to Tur\u00e1n's theorem, since 75 is greater than 56.25, the graph must contain at least one triangle. Therefore, there must be a set of three people who are all friends with each other.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check if I applied Tur\u00e1n's theorem correctly. Tur\u00e1n's theorem gives the maximum number of edges in a triangle-free graph on 15 vertices as 56.25, which we rounded down to 56. Since our graph has 75 edges, which is significantly higher, it's definitely beyond the threshold. Therefore, a triangle must exist.\n\nAlternatively, I remember something about the pigeonhole principle that might also apply here. Each person has 10 friends, so each person is connected to 10 others. With 15 people, each person is not friends with 4 others (since 15 - 1 (themselves) - 10 (friends) = 4). But I'm not sure how that helps directly, maybe it's more about ensuring that someone has enough connections to form a triangle.\n\nAnother thought: maybe using the concept of average degree. The average degree in the graph is (2 * number of edges) / n = (2 * 75) / 15 = 10. So, the average degree is 10, which is the minimum degree as given. Perhaps using Dirac's theorem, which states that if a graph has n vertices and each vertex has degree at least n/2, then the graph is Hamiltonian, meaning it contains a cycle that visits every vertex exactly once. But I'm not sure if that directly leads to a triangle.\n\nWait, maybe I should think in terms of complement graphs. The complement of our original graph would have edges where there were not friendships. So, in the complement graph, each vertex would have degree 15 - 1 - 10 = 4, since each person is not friends with 4 others. Now, if the complement graph has 15 vertices each with degree 4, perhaps we can apply some theorem there. Maybe Tur\u00e1n's theorem again? But Tur\u00e1n's theorem for the complement graph would relate to avoiding cliques in the original graph, which is what we want.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the theorem that states that if a graph has minimum degree d, then it contains a clique of size k where k is something related to d. I'm not exactly recalling the precise statement, but I think that if the minimum degree is high enough, cliques must exist.\n\nWait, another approach: consider any vertex and look at its neighborhood. Each vertex has 10 friends. So, in the neighborhood of any vertex, there are 10 other vertices. If any two of these 10 are friends, then we have a triangle. So, to avoid a triangle, none of the 10 friends can be friends with each other. But how many edges can we have in a triangle-free neighborhood?\n\nIn a triangle-free graph, the maximum number of edges is given by Tur\u00e1n's theorem again. For a triangle-free graph on 10 vertices, the maximum number of edges is floor(10^2 / 4) = 25. So, in the neighborhood of a vertex, we can have at most 25 edges without forming a triangle. But our neighborhood has 10 vertices, and each has a degree in the original graph of at least 10. Wait, no, in the neighborhood, each vertex has a certain degree.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm complicating things. Let's think differently. If each vertex has 10 friends, and we want to ensure that in their list of friends, there are no edges, meaning that in the original graph, the friends are not connected. But each friend has 10 friends, so each friend could potentially be friends with 10 others, which might overlap with the original vertex's friends.\n\nWait, maybe using the concept of Ramsey numbers. The Ramsey number R(3, k) is the smallest number such that any graph of that size contains either a triangle or an independent set of size k. But I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the theorem by Mantel, which is a specific case of Tur\u00e1n's theorem for triangle-free graphs. Mantel's theorem states that the maximum number of edges in a triangle-free graph on n vertices is floor(n\u00b2/4). So, for n=15, that would be floor(225/4) = 56. So, any graph with more than 56 edges must contain a triangle. Since our graph has 75 edges, which is much higher, it must contain at least one triangle.\n\nTherefore, combining this with the given that each person has at least 10 friends, the total number of edges is 75, which exceeds the Tur\u00e1n threshold, so a triangle must exist.\n\nI think that covers it. So, the key steps are:\n\n1. Model the problem as a graph with 15 vertices, each of degree at least 10.\n2. Calculate the total number of edges, which is 75.\n3. Apply Mantel's theorem (a special case of Tur\u00e1n's theorem) for triangle-free graphs, which gives a maximum of 56 edges.\n4. Since 75 > 56, the graph must contain at least one triangle.\n\nTherefore, there must be a set of three people who are all friends with each other.\n</think>\n\nThe problem can be solved using graph theory concepts, specifically Tur\u00e1n's theorem. Here's the step-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Model the Problem as a Graph**:\n   - Represent each person as a vertex.\n   - Represent each friendship as an edge between two vertices.\n\n2. **Graph Properties**:\n   - The graph has 15 vertices (people).\n   - Each vertex has a degree of at least 10 (each person has at least 10 friends).\n\n3. **Calculate Total Number of Edges**:\n   - Sum of degrees = 15 * 10 = 150.\n   - Number of edges = 150 / 2 = 75.\n\n4. **Apply Tur\u00e1n's Theorem (Specifically Mantel's Theorem for Triangle-Free Graphs)**:\n   - Mantel's theorem states that the maximum number of edges in a triangle-free graph with n vertices is \u230an\u00b2/4\u230b.\n   - For n = 15: Maximum edges without a triangle = 15\u00b2 / 4 = 56.25, which floors to 56 edges.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the graph has 75 edges, which is greater than 56, it must contain at least one triangle (a set of three mutual friends).\n\n**Final Answer**: There must exist at least one set of three people who are all friends with each other.

If each person has at least 10 friends in the group, prove that there must exist at least one set of 3 people who are all friends with each other (forming a 'friendship triangle'). \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I've got this problem here about friends in a social media group. Let me try to wrap my head around it. There are 15 people, and some of them are friends on this platform. The condition is that each person has at least 10 friends within this group. I need to prove that there must be at least one set of three people who are all friends with each other, forming a \"friendship triangle.\" \n\nHmm, okay. So, it's a problem about graph theory, right? If I think of each person as a node and each friendship as an edge connecting two nodes, then this group of 15 people is a graph with 15 vertices. The condition that each person has at least 10 friends translates to every vertex having a degree of at least 10. \n\nNow, the goal is to show that this graph contains a triangle, which is a set of three vertices where each is connected to the other two, forming a cycle of length three. So, in other words, I need to prove that such a graph is not triangle-free. \n\nI remember something about Tur\u00e1n's theorem, which gives the maximum number of edges a graph can have without containing a complete subgraph of a certain size. Maybe that's relevant here. Let me recall Tur\u00e1n's theorem. It states that for a graph to be triangle-free (i.e., no triangles), the maximum number of edges it can have is given by the Tur\u00e1n number T(n,2), which is the complete bipartite graph with partitions as equal as possible. \n\nWait, for n=15, what's the maximum number of edges in a triangle-free graph? So, if I divide 15 into two as equal parts as possible, that would be 7 and 8. So, the Tur\u00e1n graph T(15,2) is a complete bipartite graph K_{7,8}, which has 7*8=56 edges. \n\nSo, if a graph with 15 vertices has more than 56 edges, it must contain at least one triangle. Now, how many edges do we have in our case? Each person has at least 10 friends, so each vertex has degree at least 10. Since each edge is counted twice in the sum of degrees, the total number of edges is at least (15*10)/2 = 75 edges. \n\nWait, hold on. 15*10 is 150, divided by 2 is 75. So, the graph has at least 75 edges. But Tur\u00e1n's theorem says that a triangle-free graph can have at most 56 edges. So, 75 is way more than 56. That seems like a direct contradiction. Therefore, the graph must contain at least one triangle. \n\nSo, putting it all together: Since each person has at least 10 friends, the total number of edges is at least 75. But Tur\u00e1n's theorem tells us that any graph with more than 56 edges on 15 vertices must contain a triangle. Therefore, such a graph must have at least one triangle. \n\nI think that makes sense. Let me double-check if I applied Tur\u00e1n's theorem correctly. The Tur\u00e1n number T(n,r) gives the maximum number of edges in an n-vertex graph that does not contain a complete (r+1)-graph. Since we're looking for triangle-free graphs, r=2. So, T(15,2) is indeed the complete bipartite graph with partitions of 7 and 8, which has 56 edges. \n\nAnd the total number of edges in our graph is at least 75, which is way above 56, so it must contain a triangle. Yeah, that seems solid. I don't think I missed anything here. So, I think that's the proof.\n</think>\n\nAlright, let's break this down step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Model the Problem as a Graph**\nWe represent the group of 15 people as vertices in a graph, where each vertex corresponds to a person. An edge between two vertices signifies that those two people are friends on the social media platform.\n\n**Step 2: Translate the Degree Condition**\nEach person has at least 10 friends, which means each vertex in the graph has a degree of at least 10. In graph theory terms, each vertex has a degree \u2265 10.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Total Number of Edges**\nThe sum of all vertex degrees in a graph is equal to twice the number of edges. Therefore, the total number of edges \\( E \\) is:\n\\[\nE = \\frac{\\sum \\text{degrees}}{2} \\geq \\frac{15 \\times 10}{2} = 75\n\\]\nSo, the graph has at least 75 edges.\n\n**Step 4: Apply Tur\u00e1n's Theorem**\nTur\u00e1n's theorem states that the maximum number of edges in a triangle-free (i.e., no three vertices all connected to each other) graph with \\( n \\) vertices is given by:\n\\[\nT(n,2) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n^2}{4} \\right\\rfloor\n\\]\nFor \\( n = 15 \\):\n\\[\nT(15,2) = \\frac{15^2}{4} = \\frac{225}{4} = 56.25\n\\]\nSince the number of edges must be an integer, the maximum triangle-free graph has 56 edges.\n\n**Step 5: Compare the Number of Edges**\nOur graph has at least 75 edges, which is significantly more than the 56 edges allowed in a triangle-free graph. This means that the graph must contain at least one triangle.\n\n**Conclusion**\nTherefore, in a group of 15 people where each person has at least 10 friends, there must exist at least one set of three people who are all friends with each other, forming a friendship triangle.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{\\text{There must exist at least one friendship triangle.}}\n\nDONE."

Maybe that could be useful here. Tur\u00e1n's theorem states that for a graph to be triangle-free (no three vertices all connected), the maximum number of edges it can have is given by a specific formula. If the number of edges in our graph exceeds this maximum, then it must contain at least one triangle.\n\nLet me recall the formula for Tur\u00e1n's theorem. For a triangle-free graph (which is a K\u2083-free graph), the maximum number of edges is given by:\n\n\\[ \\text{Ex}(n, K_3) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n^2}{4} \\right\\rfloor \\]\n\nWhere n is the number of vertices. In our case, n is 15, so plugging that in:\n\n\\[ \\text{Ex}(15, K_3) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{15^2}{4} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{225}{4} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor 56.25 \\right\\rfloor = 56 \\]\n\nSo, according to Tur\u00e1n's theorem, a triangle-free graph with 15 vertices can have at most 56 edges.

That means our graph must contain at least one triangle. Therefore, there must be at least one set of three people who are all friends with each other.\n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, Tur\u00e1n's theorem for triangle-free graphs indeed says that the maximum edges are n\u00b2/4, which for n=15 is 56.25, so 56 edges. Our graph has at least 75 edges, which is way more than 56. So, yes, it must contain a triangle.\n\nI think that makes sense. Each person having 10 friends leads to a much higher number of edges than what a triangle-free graph can handle.

I need to prove that there must be at least one set of 3 people who are all friends with each other, forming a 'friendship triangle'. Hmm, okay, let me think about this.\n\nFirst, I remember something about graph theory from my studies. This problem sounds like it's related to graph theory because we can model the social media friendships as a graph where each person is a vertex, and each friendship is an edge connecting two vertices. So, if each person has at least 10 friends, that means the graph is 10-regular or more. But wait, regular graphs have all vertices with the same degree, but here it's just that each vertex has at least degree 10. So, it's a graph with minimum degree 10.\n\nNow, the problem is about proving that such a graph must contain a triangle, which is a set of three vertices where each pair is connected by an edge. I think there's a theorem related to this. Maybe Tur\u00e1n's theorem? Let me recall. Tur\u00e1n's theorem gives the maximum number of edges a graph can have without containing a complete subgraph of a certain size. For triangle-free graphs, Tur\u00e1n's theorem says that the maximum number of edges is achieved by the complete bipartite graph with partitions as equal as possible.\n\nSo, for triangle-free graphs, the maximum number of edges is given by Tur\u00e1n's theorem when r=2, which is the case for bipartite graphs. The formula is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Ex}(n, K_3) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n^2}{4} \\right\\rfloor \\]\n\nWhere n is the number of vertices. In this case, n=15. Let me calculate that:\n\n\\[ \\frac{15^2}{4} = \\frac{225}{4} = 56.25 \\]\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of an edge, we take the floor, so the maximum number of edges without a triangle is 56.\n\nNow, let's think about the total number of edges in our graph. Each person has at least 10 friends, so the minimum number of edges is:\n\n\\[ \\frac{15 \\times 10}{2} = 75 \\]\n\nBecause each edge is counted twice when summing the degrees. So, our graph has at least 75 edges.\n\nBut wait, Tur\u00e1n's theorem says that a triangle-free graph on 15 vertices can have at most 56 edges. However, our graph has at least 75 edges, which is way more than 56. That seems contradictory. So, does that mean that our graph cannot be triangle-free? Yes, exactly! If a graph has more edges than the Tur\u00e1n number for triangle-free graphs, it must contain at least one triangle.\n\nTherefore, in our case, since the graph has 75 edges, which is greater than the maximum triangle-free edges of 56, it must contain at least one triangle. So, there must be at least one set of three people who are all friends with each other.\n\nWait, let me double-check my reasoning. Tur\u00e1n's theorem for triangle-free (i.e., no K3) graphs indeed gives the maximum edges as floor(n\u00b2/4). For n=15, that's 56.25, so 56 edges. If our graph has more than 56 edges, then it must contain at least one triangle. Since each person has at least 10 friends, the total number of edges is at least 75, which is more than 56. Hence, a triangle must exist.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the key was to apply Tur\u00e1n's theorem to find the maximum number of edges a triangle-free graph can have and then compare it to the minimum number of edges in our case. Since our graph has more edges than that maximum, it must contain a triangle.\n\nAnother way to think about it is using the pigeonhole principle or maybe considering the degrees of the vertices. If everyone has a high enough degree, it's inevitable that some connections will overlap in a way that forms a triangle.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using Dirac's theorem, which says that if each vertex has degree at least n/2, then the graph is Hamiltonian, meaning it has a cycle that visits every vertex exactly once. But in our case, n=15, so n/2=7.5. Our minimum degree is 10, which is higher, so Dirac's theorem would apply, but I'm not sure if that directly helps with triangles. Maybe it's overcomplicating.\n\nNo, Tur\u00e1n's theorem seems the right approach here. It directly gives the condition for the existence of a triangle based on the number of edges. So, I think my reasoning is correct.\n</think>\n\nAlright, so after thinking it through, here's the step-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Model the Problem as a Graph**: Represent each person as a vertex and each friendship as an edge in a graph with 15 vertices.\n\n2. **Minimum Degree Condition**: Each vertex (person) has a degree of at least 10, meaning each person has at least 10 friends.\n\n3. **Calculate Total Edges**: The minimum number of edges in this graph is calculated by summing the degrees and dividing by 2 (since each edge is counted twice):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{15 \\times 10}{2} = 75 \\text{ edges}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Apply Tur\u00e1n's Theorem**: Tur\u00e1n's theorem states that the maximum number of edges in a triangle-free (no K\u2083) graph with 15 vertices is:\n   \\[\n   \\left\\lfloor \\frac{15^2}{4} \\right\\rfloor = 56 \\text{ edges}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Compare Edges**: Since our graph has 75 edges, which is more than the maximum 56 edges allowed for a triangle-free graph, it must contain at least one triangle.\n\nTherefore, there must exist at least one set of 3 people who are all friends with each other.\n\n**DONE.**"

I need to prove that there must be at least one set of three people who are all friends with each other, forming a 'friendship triangle'. Hmm, okay. Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I should probably model this situation using graph theory. I remember that in graph theory, we can represent people as vertices and friendships as edges. So, this problem is about a graph with 15 vertices where each vertex has a degree of at least 10. The goal is to show that this graph must contain at least one triangle, which is a set of three vertices all connected to each other.\n\nI think Tur\u00e1n's Theorem might be relevant here. Tur\u00e1n's Theorem gives the maximum number of edges a graph can have without containing a complete subgraph of a certain size. Specifically, Tur\u00e1n's Theorem states that for a graph to be triangle-free (no triangles), the maximum number of edges it can have is given by the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Ex}(n, K_3) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n^2}{4} \\right\\rfloor \\]\n\nWhere \\( n \\) is the number of vertices. In this case, \\( n = 15 \\). Let me calculate the maximum number of edges a triangle-free graph on 15 vertices can have.\n\nCalculating \\( \\frac{15^2}{4} \\):\n15 squared is 225. Divided by 4 is 56.25. Since the number of edges must be an integer, we take the floor, which is 56. So, the maximum number of edges without a triangle is 56.\n\nNow, let's find out how many edges are in our graph. Each person has at least 10 friends, so the graph is 10-regular or more. The total number of edges in a graph is \\( \\frac{sum \\, of \\, degrees}{2} \\). Since each of the 15 people has at least 10 friends, the sum of degrees is at least \\( 15 \\times 10 = 150 \\). Therefore, the total number of edges is at least \\( 150 / 2 = 75 \\).\n\nBut wait, Tur\u00e1n's Theorem says that to avoid a triangle, the graph can have at most 56 edges. But in our case, the graph has at least 75 edges, which is way more than 56. That seems like a contradiction. So, if our graph has more edges than the maximum allowed for a triangle-free graph, it must contain at least one triangle.\n\nLet me make sure I'm applying Tur\u00e1n's Theorem correctly. Tur\u00e1n's Theorem for triangle-free graphs (i.e., no \\( K_3 \\)) indeed gives the maximum number of edges as \\( \\lfloor n^2/4 \\rfloor \\). For n=15, that's 56.25, so 56 edges. If our graph has more than 56 edges, it must contain at least one triangle. Since our graph has at least 75 edges, which is way more than 56, it must contain at least one triangle.\n\nWait, is that all? It seems straightforward. Maybe I should think about it another way to confirm. Perhaps using the pigeonhole principle or some other method.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the average degree. The average degree \\( d \\) is \\( \\frac{2E}{n} \\). In our case, \\( E \\geq 75 \\), so average degree is \\( 2*75 /15 = 10 \\). So, average degree is 10.\n\nThere's a theorem by Mantel which is actually a specific case of Tur\u00e1n's Theorem for triangle-free graphs. It states that the maximum number of edges in a triangle-free graph is \\( \\lfloor n^2/4 \\rfloor \\). So, Mantel's Theorem confirms the same result as Tur\u00e1n's Theorem in this case.\n\nGiven that our graph has more than the maximum allowed by Mantel's Theorem, it must contain at least one triangle. Therefore, the conclusion follows.\n\nI think that's solid. So, summarizing: Using Tur\u00e1n's Theorem, we find that a triangle-free graph on 15 vertices can have at most 56 edges. Since our graph has at least 75 edges, it must contain at least one triangle. Therefore, there must exist a set of three people who are all friends with each other.\n</think>\n\nTo prove that in a group of 15 people, where each person has at least 10 friends, there must exist a set of 3 people who are all friends with each other, we can use Tur\u00e1n's Theorem.\n\n1. **Model the Problem as a Graph**: Represent each person as a vertex and each friendship as an edge. The graph has 15 vertices, and each vertex has a degree of at least 10.\n\n2. **Apply Tur\u00e1n's Theorem**: For a graph to be triangle-free (no three mutual friends), the maximum number of edges it can have is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Ex}(15, K_3) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{15^2}{4} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor 56.25 \\right\\rfloor = 56\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Calculate the Number of Edges in the Graph**: Each person has at least 10 friends, so the total number of edges is at least:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{15 \\times 10}{2} = 75\n   \\]\n   \n4. **Compare the Number of Edges**: Since 75 edges exceed the maximum of 56 edges allowed for a triangle-free graph, the graph must contain at least one triangle.\n\n**Conclusion**: There must exist at least one set of three people who are all friends with each other.\n\nDONE."

If each person has at least 10 friends in the group, prove that there must exist at least one set of 3 people who are all friends with each other (forming a 'friendship triangle'). \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem where there are 15 people in a group, and each person has at least 10 friends in this group. I need to prove that there must be at least one friendship triangle, which means three people who are all friends with each other. Hmm, interesting. I remember something about graph theory from my classes, so maybe I can model this problem using graphs.\n\nLet me think. If I represent each person as a vertex in a graph, then each friendship is an edge connecting two vertices. So, the problem is about a graph with 15 vertices where each vertex has a degree of at least 10. The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to it, which corresponds to the number of friends each person has. \n\nNow, I need to show that this graph must contain a triangle, which is a set of three vertices where each is connected to the other two. I think this might be related to Tur\u00e1n's theorem. Tur\u00e1n's theorem gives the maximum number of edges a graph can have without containing a complete subgraph of a certain size. Specifically, Tur\u00e1n's theorem says that for a graph to be triangle-free (no three mutual friends), the maximum number of edges it can have is given by a specific formula.\n\nLet me recall the formula. For a triangle-free graph with n vertices, the maximum number of edges is \u230an\u00b2/4\u230b. So, if a graph has more edges than this, it must contain at least one triangle. \n\nAlright, so let's apply this to our problem. We have n = 15 people. If each person has at least 10 friends, then the total number of edges in the graph is at least (15 * 10) / 2 = 75. Because each edge is counted twice when summing the degrees. \n\nWait, let me make sure. If each of the 15 people has at least 10 friends, then the sum of all degrees is at least 15 * 10 = 150. Since each edge contributes to two degrees, the number of edges is 150 / 2 = 75. So, the total number of edges is at least 75.\n\nNow, what's the maximum number of edges a triangle-free graph can have? Using Tur\u00e1n's theorem, it's \u230a15\u00b2 / 4\u230b. Let's compute that. 15 squared is 225, and 225 divided by 4 is 56.25. Taking the floor of that gives 56. So, a triangle-free graph with 15 vertices can have at most 56 edges.\n\nBut in our case, the graph has at least 75 edges, which is way more than 56. Therefore, by Tur\u00e1n's theorem, this graph must contain at least one triangle. \n\nWait, is that all? Did I miss something? Let me double-check. Tur\u00e1n's theorem says that any graph with more than n\u00b2/4 edges must contain a triangle. Since 75 is greater than 56.25, which is n\u00b2/4 for n=15, the graph must have a triangle. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nSo, putting it all together, each person having at least 10 friends leads to a graph with 75 edges, which exceeds the maximum number of edges a triangle-free graph can have. Therefore, there must be at least one friendship triangle in the group.\n\nI think that covers it. I'm using Tur\u00e1n's theorem correctly, right? Let me make sure Tur\u00e1n's theorem applies here. Tur\u00e1n's theorem indeed tells us the maximum number of edges in a graph without a (r+1)-clique, which for r=2 (triangle-free) is n\u00b2/4. So yes, applying it here is appropriate.\n\nAnother way to think about it is using the pigeonhole principle. If each person has a high number of friends, it's impossible for all their friendships to be arranged without creating a triangle. But the Tur\u00e1n's theorem approach is more straightforward and mathematical.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the proof is complete. There must be at least one set of three people who are all friends with each other.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we model the group of 15 people as a graph where each person is a vertex and each friendship is an edge. Each vertex has a degree of at least 10, meaning each person has at least 10 friends. The total number of edges in this graph is at least 75 (since each edge is counted twice in the sum of degrees). \n\nUsing Tur\u00e1n's theorem, a triangle-free graph with 15 vertices can have at most 56 edges. Since our graph has 75 edges, which exceeds 56, it must contain at least one triangle. Therefore, there must exist a set of three people who are all friends with each other.\n\n**Answer:** DONE."

I need to prove that there must be at least one triangle, meaning three people who are all friends with each other. Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, this seems like a graph theory problem. I can model the group of people as a graph where each person is a vertex, and each friendship is an edge connecting two vertices. So, we have a graph with 15 vertices, and each vertex has a degree of at least 10. That means each person is connected to at least 10 others.\n\nNow, the goal is to show that this graph must contain at least one triangle, which is a set of three vertices all connected to each other.

Maybe that could be useful here.\n\nTur\u00e1n's theorem states that for a graph to be triangle-free (no three vertices all connected), the maximum number of edges it can have is given by the formula:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of edges} \\leq \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n^2}{4} \\right\\rfloor \\]\n\nwhere \\( n \\) is the number of vertices. In this case, \\( n = 15 \\). Let me calculate that.\n\nSo, \\( 15^2 = 225 \\), and \\( 225 / 4 = 56.25 \\). Since we can't have a fraction of an edge, we take the floor, which gives 56 edges.\n\nWait, but our graph has 15 vertices, each with at least 10 edges. So, the total number of edges must be at least \\( (15 \\times 10) / 2 = 75 \\). Because each edge is counted twice when summing degrees.\n\nBut Tur\u00e1n's theorem says that a triangle-free graph can have at most 56 edges. But we need 75 edges, which is way more than 56. That seems contradictory. So, that would imply that our graph must have a triangle because it exceeds the maximum number of edges a triangle-free graph can have.\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm applying Tur\u00e1n's theorem correctly. Tur\u00e1n's theorem gives the maximum number of edges in a graph that doesn't contain a complete graph \\( K_r \\). For triangles, which are \\( K_3 \\), the maximum is indeed \\( \\lfloor n^2/4 \\rfloor \\). So, for \\( n = 15 \\), it's 56 edges.\n\nBut our graph has each of the 15 vertices with degree at least 10, so the total number of edges is at least \\( (15 \\times 10) / 2 = 75 \\). Since 75 is greater than 56, our graph must contain at least one triangle.\n\nIs that all? Did I just solve it? Let me double-check. Each person has at least 10 friends, so the total number of edges is at least 75. Tur\u00e1n's theorem says a triangle-free graph can't have more than 56 edges. Therefore, since 75 > 56, the graph must contain at least one triangle. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about it using the pigeonhole principle or some other combinatorial argument. Let's see.\n\nEach person has 14 possible friends (since there are 15 people in total). If each person has at least 10 friends, that means each person is not friends with at least 4 people. So, the complement graph (where edges represent non-friendships) has each vertex with degree at most 4.\n\nNow, in the complement graph, each vertex has degree \u22644. The complement graph has 15 vertices, each with degree \u22644. So, the maximum number of edges in the complement graph is \\( (15 \\times 4) / 2 = 30 \\) edges.\n\nWait, but in the original graph, the number of edges is at least 75, so the complement graph has at most 15 choose 2 minus 75. Let me calculate that.\n\nTotal possible edges: \\( C(15,2) = 105 \\). So, if original graph has at least 75 edges, the complement graph has at most 105 - 75 = 30 edges. Which matches with the earlier calculation since each vertex in the complement has degree \u22644, so total edges \u226430.\n\nBut how does this help? Hmm. Maybe using Ramsey theory? Because Ramsey numbers tell us the minimum number of vertices needed to guarantee a triangle or independent set of a certain size.\n\nThe Ramsey number \\( R(3, k) \\) is the smallest number such that any graph of that size contains either a triangle or an independent set of size k. But I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here.\n\nWait, but since the complement graph has maximum degree 4, maybe we can use some other theorem. Maybe Dirac's theorem or something else related to Hamiltonian cycles? But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the number of triangles directly. Let's think about the number of triangles in the graph. Maybe using some counting argument.\n\nEach edge is part of a certain number of triangles. If the graph has too many edges, the number of triangles must be positive.\n\nWait, but I think the initial approach with Tur\u00e1n's theorem is sufficient. Since the total number of edges in the graph is more than the maximum allowed for a triangle-free graph, it must contain at least one triangle.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n- Total edges \u2265 75.\n\n- Maximum edges in a triangle-free graph on 15 vertices is 56.\n\n- 75 > 56, so the graph must contain at least one triangle.\n\nTherefore, such a set of three friends must exist.\n\nI think that's a solid proof. I don't see any gaps in the logic. It all checks out.\n</think>\n\nTo prove that in a group of 15 people, where each person has at least 10 friends, there must exist at least one set of 3 people who are all friends with each other (a 'friendship triangle'), we can use Tur\u00e1n's theorem.\n\n1. **Model the Problem as a Graph:**\n   - Consider each person as a vertex in a graph.\n   - Each friendship is an edge between two vertices.\n\n2. **Apply Tur\u00e1n's Theorem:**\n   - Tur\u00e1n's theorem states that a triangle-free graph (no three vertices all connected) on \\( n \\) vertices can have at most \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n^2}{4} \\right\\rfloor \\) edges.\n   - For \\( n = 15 \\), the maximum number of edges in a triangle-free graph is \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{15^2}{4} \\right\\rfloor = 56 \\) edges.\n\n3. **Calculate the Minimum Number of Edges:**\n   - Each of the 15 people has at least 10 friends, so the total number of edges \\( E \\) is at least \\( \\frac{15 \\times 10}{2} = 75 \\) edges.\n\n4. **Compare with Tur\u00e1n's Bound:**\n   - Since \\( 75 > 56 \\), the graph must contain at least one triangle.\n\n**Conclusion:** There must exist at least one set of three people who are all friends with each other.\n\nDONE."

Hmm, okay, interesting. I think this might be related to graph theory because we're talking about people and their friendships, which can be represented as nodes and edges in a graph. \n\nLet me try to visualize this. If I consider each person as a node, then each friendship is an edge connecting two nodes. The problem is stating that in a graph of 15 nodes, each node has at least 10 edges. So, it's a graph with 15 vertices, each of degree at least 10. The goal is to prove that there's at least one triangle, which is a set of three nodes all connected to each other, forming a cycle of length 3.\n\nI remember something called Tur\u00e1n's theorem, which gives the maximum number of edges a graph can have without containing a complete subgraph of a certain size. Maybe that could be useful here. Tur\u00e1n's theorem for triangle-free graphs (which are K3-free) says that the maximum number of edges is achieved by the complete bipartite graph K_{n/2,n/2}. But wait, our graph isn't necessarily bipartite, and we're dealing with 15 nodes. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the pigeonhole principle. Since each person has at least 10 friends, and there are 14 other people, each person is missing at most 3 non-friends. So, each person has at least 10 friends, which means each person is not friends with at most 3 people. \n\nIf I consider all the non-friendships in the graph, each person contributes at most 3 non-friendships. So, in total, how many non-friendships are there? Since there are 15 people, each contributing at most 3 non-friendships, that would be 15 * 3 = 45 non-friendships. But wait, each non-friendship is counted twice if I do it this way because if person A is not friends with person B, that's one non-friendship, but I'm counting it once for A and once for B. So actually, the total number of unique non-friendships is 45 / 2, which is 22.5. But since you can't have half a non-friendship, it must be 22 or 23. But since the total number of possible non-friendships in a group of 15 is C(15,2) = 105, which is much larger than 22, this approach might not be sufficient.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about it differently. If each person has at least 10 friends, then the graph has a minimum degree of 10. There's a theorem called Mantel's theorem, which is actually a special case of Tur\u00e1n's theorem, stating that the maximum number of edges in a triangle-free graph is floor(n\u00b2/4). For n=15, that would be floor(225/4) = 56. So, if our graph has more than 56 edges, it must contain at least one triangle.\n\nBut in our case, each person has at least 10 friends, so the total number of edges is at least (15 * 10)/2 = 75 edges. Since 75 is greater than 56, which is the maximum number of edges a triangle-free graph can have, it must contain at least one triangle. Therefore, there must exist at least one set of 3 people who are all friends with each other.\n\nWait, does this make sense? Let me double-check. Mantel's theorem says that the maximum number of edges without a triangle is floor(n\u00b2/4). For n=15, that's 56.25, so 56 edges. If our graph has more than that, it must have a triangle. Since each person has at least 10 friends, the total number of edges is at least (15*10)/2 = 75, which is indeed greater than 56. So, yes, that seems correct.\n\nI think that's the solution. So, the key was applying Mantel's theorem to the total number of edges required by the minimum degree condition and comparing it to the maximum number of edges a triangle-free graph can have.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we can use Mantel's theorem, which states that the maximum number of edges in a triangle-free graph with \\( n \\) vertices is \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n^2}{4} \\right\\rfloor \\). For \\( n = 15 \\), this maximum is 56 edges.\n\nGiven that each person has at least 10 friends, the total number of edges \\( E \\) in the graph must satisfy:\n\\[\nE \\geq \\frac{15 \\times 10}{2} = 75\n\\]\nSince 75 edges exceed the maximum number of edges (56) that a triangle-free graph can have, the graph must contain at least one triangle.

If each person has at least 10 friends in the group, prove that there must exist at least one set of 3 people who are all friends with each other (forming a 'friendship triangle'). \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this problem where there are 15 people in a group, and each person has at least 10 friends within this group. I need to prove that there must be at least one set of three people who are all friends with each other, forming a \"friendship triangle.\" Hmm, okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I know that in graph theory, this situation can be modeled as a graph with 15 vertices, where each vertex represents a person, and an edge between two vertices indicates that those two people are friends. The problem states that each person has at least 10 friends, which translates to each vertex having a degree of at least 10. So, we're dealing with a graph where every vertex has degree \u226510.\n\nNow, the goal is to show that this graph must contain at least one triangle, which is a set of three vertices all connected to each other. In other words, the graph isn't triangle-free. I recall that Tur\u00e1n's theorem might be relevant here, as it gives the maximum number of edges a graph can have without containing a complete subgraph of a certain size. Tur\u00e1n's theorem states that the maximum number of edges in an n-vertex graph without a (r+1)-clique is given by a specific formula. For triangles, which are 3-cliques, r would be 2.\n\nSo, applying Tur\u00e1n's theorem for triangle-free graphs (r=2), the maximum number of edges without a triangle is given by:\n\n\\[ \\text{Tur\u00e1n number } T(n,2) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n^2}{4} \\right\\rfloor \\]\n\nFor n=15, this would be:\n\n\\[ T(15,2) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{15^2}{4} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{225}{4} \\right\\rfloor = 56 \\]\n\nSo, a triangle-free graph with 15 vertices can have at most 56 edges. If our graph has more than 56 edges, it must contain at least one triangle. Therefore, if the number of edges in our graph exceeds 56, we can conclude the existence of a triangle.\n\nNow, let's compute the minimum number of edges in our graph. Each person has at least 10 friends, so the total number of edges is at least:\n\n\\[ \\text{Number of edges} \\geq \\frac{15 \\times 10}{2} = 75 \\]\n\nBecause each edge is counted twice when summing the degrees. So, the graph has at least 75 edges.\n\nComparing this to Tur\u00e1n's number, 75 is greater than 56. Therefore, by Tur\u00e1n's theorem, our graph must contain at least one triangle.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check my reasoning. Is Tur\u00e1n's theorem applicable here? Tur\u00e1n's theorem gives the maximum edges for a graph without a (r+1)-clique, so for triangle-free, r=2, which gives the maximum edges as \u230an\u00b2/4\u230b. Yes, that's correct. And since our graph has more edges than that, it must have a triangle. That seems solid.\n\nIs there another way to approach this? Maybe using the pigeonhole principle or considering degrees. Let's think about degrees. Each person has 10 friends. If we look at each person's friends, they have 10 friends, and there are 14 other people in the group. So, each person is not friends with 4 people (since 15-1-10=4). \n\nBut how does that help? Maybe by considering that if each person has 10 friends, the friends of a person could potentially overlap with others. But I think the Tur\u00e1n approach is more straightforward here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using Dirac's theorem, which states that a graph with n vertices (n \u2265 3) is Hamiltonian if each vertex has degree \u2265 n/2. But that's about cycles, not necessarily triangles. So maybe not directly applicable.\n\nAnother thought: in a triangle-free graph, the number of edges is bounded by n\u00b2/4. So, if our graph exceeds that, triangles must exist. Since our graph has 75 edges and the maximum triangle-free graph has 56 edges, it's way beyond that threshold.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that in such a graph, there must be at least one triangle.\n</think>\n\nIn a group of 15 people, where each person has at least 10 friends, we can model this as a graph with 15 vertices (people) and edges between friends. Each vertex has a degree of at least 10. Using Tur\u00e1n's theorem, which states that the maximum number of edges in a triangle-free graph with \\( n \\) vertices is \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n^2}{4} \\right\\rfloor \\), we calculate:\n\n\\[ T(15,2) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{15^2}{4} \\right\\rfloor = 56 \\]\n\nSince the total number of edges in our graph is at least \\( \\frac{15 \\times 10}{2} = 75 \\), which exceeds 56, the graph must contain at least one triangle.

Hmm, okay, let me try to figure this out.\n\nFirst off, I remember something about graph theory from my math class. I think this problem can be modeled as a graph where each person is a vertex, and each friendship is an edge connecting two vertices. So, we have 15 vertices, and each vertex has at least 10 edges connected to it. That means the graph is pretty densely connected.\n\nI also recall something about Tur\u00e1n's theorem, which gives the maximum number of edges a graph can have without containing a complete subgraph of a certain size. Maybe that's relevant here because we want to ensure there's a triangle, which is a complete subgraph of size 3.\n\nTur\u00e1n's theorem states that for a graph to not contain a (k+1)-clique, the maximum number of edges it can have is given by a specific formula. In our case, we're dealing with triangles, so k would be 2. The formula is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Maximum edges without a triangle} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n^2}{4} \\right\\rfloor \\]\n\nWhere n is the number of vertices. Plugging in 15 for n, we get:\n\n\\[ \\frac{15^2}{4} = \\frac{225}{4} = 56.25 \\]\n\nSince the number of edges must be an integer, we take the floor, so 56 edges. That means if a graph with 15 vertices has more than 56 edges, it must contain at least one triangle.\n\nNow, let's check how many edges we have in our problem. Each of the 15 people has at least 10 friends. In graph terms, each vertex has a degree of at least 10. The sum of all degrees is twice the number of edges because each edge is counted twice (once for each endpoint). So, the total degree is:\n\n15 people * 10 friends = 150\n\nTherefore, the number of edges is:\n\n150 / 2 = 75\n\nSo, we have 75 edges in the graph. Comparing this to Tur\u00e1n's theorem, 75 is greater than 56, which means the graph must contain at least one triangle. Therefore, there must be at least one set of three people who are all friends with each other.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Tur\u00e1n's theorem says that any graph with more than n\u00b2/4 edges has a triangle. For n=15, n\u00b2/4 is 56.25, so 75 edges is definitely more than that. So, yes, that seems right. Also, each person having at least 10 friends means the graph is quite dense, so it's likely to have triangles.\n\nI think that covers it. So, by Tur\u00e1n's theorem, the number of edges exceeds the maximum without a triangle, so a triangle must exist.\n</think>\n\nTo prove that in a group of 15 people, where each person has at least 10 friends, there must exist at least one friendship triangle, we can use Tur\u00e1n's theorem. \n\n1. **Model the Problem as a Graph**: Represent each person as a vertex and each friendship as an edge. This gives a graph with 15 vertices, each having a degree of at least 10.\n\n2. **Calculate the Total Number of Edges**: Since each of the 15 vertices has at least 10 edges, the total degree is 15 \u00d7 10 = 150. The number of edges is half the total degree, which is 75.\n\n3. **Apply Tur\u00e1n's Theorem**: Tur\u00e1n's theorem states that a graph with more than \\(\\left\\lfloor \\frac{n^2}{4} \\right\\rfloor\\) edges must contain a triangle. For n = 15, this threshold is \\(\\frac{15^2}{4} = 56.25\\), so 56 edges.\n\n4. **Compare the Number of Edges**: Since the graph has 75 edges, which is greater than 56, it must contain at least one triangle.\n\n**Conclusion**: Therefore, there must exist at least one set of three people who are all friends with each other, forming a friendship triangle.\n\nDONE."
