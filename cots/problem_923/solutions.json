Each one is made up of cubes connected face-to-face. The question is asking which two shapes are identical if I can rotate them in 3D space. Hmm, okay, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to visualize each shape. Let's go through them one by one.\n\n**Shape A:** It looks like the letter 'L' made of 3 cubes. So, if I imagine three cubes connected in an L-shape, that's pretty straightforward. The base cube is connected to another cube on one face, and that second cube is connected to a third cube on a different face, forming an L.\n\n**Shape B:** This one is a straight line of 3 cubes. So, all three cubes are connected in a single straight line, each connected face-to-face in a straight line. That's pretty simple\u2014like a 3x1x1 block.\n\n**Shape C:** It's described as a shape that looks like a stair with 3 cubes. Hmm, a stair step. So, I'm picturing a cube connected to another cube on top of it, and then a third cube attached to the side of the second one, kind of forming a step. Maybe like a 2x2 base with one cube missing on one side, but only three cubes in total.\n\n**Shape D:** This is another 'L' shape, but oriented differently. So, it's like Shape A but maybe rotated so that the \"elbow\" is in a different orientation. For example, instead of the L being in the horizontal and vertical directions, it might be in a vertical and depth direction. But since we're allowed to rotate them, the orientation might not matter as much\u2014what matters is the connectivity and the overall structure.\n\n**Shape E:** It looks like a corner with 3 cubes. So, similar to an L-shape, but in 3D. Maybe two cubes connected on one face, and the third cube connected to the second one on a different face, creating a corner. Wait, that might actually be the same as Shape A or D. Hmm, need to be careful here.\n\nNow, the key is to determine which two shapes are identical when rotated. So, even if they look different in their given orientation, after rotation, they should match.\n\nLet's consider each pair:\n\n1. **Shapes A and B:** Shape A is an L-shape, and Shape B is a straight line. These are definitely not identical because one is L and the other is straight. No way to rotate an L-shape to make it a straight line.\n\n2. **Shapes A and C:** Shape A is an L-shape, and Shape C is a stair. If I rotate Shape A, can I make it look like a stair? Hmm, not really. The L-shape has a 90-degree corner, while the stair has a sort of diagonal step. They don't seem to align after rotation.\n\n3. **Shapes A and D:** Both are L-shapes, but oriented differently. Since we can rotate them, these should be identical. The only difference is their initial orientation, but with rotation, they can be made to match each other. So, A and D could be the same.\n\n4. **Shapes A and E:** Shape E is a corner with 3 cubes, which sounds like an L-shape as well. So, similar to Shape A and D. If Shape E is also an L-shape, then it's identical to A and D. But wait, the problem says there are five shapes, so I need to be precise.\n\nWait, maybe I misinterpreted Shape E. If it's a corner with 3 cubes, maybe it's not exactly an L-shape. Let me think: three cubes connected such that each is connected to the next, forming a corner. So, cube 1 connected to cube 2, and cube 2 connected to cube 3, with each connection on a different face. So, it's like a zig-zag in 3D, but with only three cubes. That would actually form an L-shape in 3D, right? Because it's two cubes connected on one face, and the third cube connected to one of them on another face, making a right angle.\n\nSo, if that's the case, Shape E is also an L-shape, just oriented in a way that's a corner. So, Shape E is identical to Shape A and D.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"which two shapes are identical,\" implying there's one pair. So, maybe I need to check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Shape E is different. If it's a corner with three cubes, perhaps it's a straight corner, like three cubes connected in a straight line, but in a corner. Wait, that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, maybe it's like a 2x2 square missing one cube, but with only three cubes. No, that would require more cubes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Shape E is like a \"corner\" where each cube is connected on different faces, but not in an L-shape. Let me visualize: cube 1 connected to cube 2 on the front face, and cube 2 connected to cube 3 on the right face. So, it's like a corner but in 3D, making a sort of diagonal L-shape.\n\nWait, actually, that's the same as Shape A and D. So, all three\u2014A, D, and E\u2014are L-shapes. But the problem says five shapes, so they must be distinct.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the actual structures.\n\n- Shape A: 3 cubes in an L-shape (like a corner).\n- Shape B: 3 cubes in a straight line.\n- Shape C: 3 cubes forming a stair step (like a 2x2 base with one cube on top of one, but only three cubes\u2014so it's like a single step with two cubes on the base and one on top? Or is it a straight stair with three cubes, each on top of the previous? No, that would be a straight line. So, maybe it's a 2x1 base with one cube on top of one end, making a step.\n\nWait, if it's a stair with three cubes, it's probably two cubes on the bottom and one on top of one of them, forming a step. So, like:\n\n  X\nXXX\n\nBut that's two on the bottom and one on top, making a stair. So, Shape C is like that.\n\nShape D: Another L-shape but oriented differently. So, same as A but maybe rotated 90 degrees, but since we can rotate, it's the same as A.\n\nShape E: A corner with three cubes. So, it's like two cubes connected on one face, and the third cube connected to one of them on another face, forming a corner. So, that's the same as Shape A and D.\n\nWait, but the problem says each shape consists of cubes connected face-to-face, so each connection is a face. So, for Shape E, it's three cubes where each cube is connected to the others on different faces.\n\nBut Shape A is also three cubes connected on different faces in an L-shape. So, Shape E is the same as Shape A and D.\n\nBut the problem says five shapes, so they must be distinct. Therefore, I must have misinterpreted some shapes.\n\nWait, maybe Shape C is different. Let me think again.\n\nIf Shape C is a stair with three cubes, perhaps it's a straight line of three cubes, but arranged in a way that looks like a stair when viewed from above. So, like:\n\n  X\nXXX\n\nBut that's two cubes on the bottom and one on top, making a stair step. So, it's a 2x2 arrangement with one cube missing. So, Shape C is like that.\n\nShape E: A corner with three cubes. So, it's a single cube connected to two others on different faces, forming a corner. So, like:\n\n  X\nXXX\n\nWait, no, that's two on the bottom and one on top. If it's a corner, it's more like:\n\n  X\n  X\n  X\n\nBut that's three cubes, each connected to the next in a corner. So, each cube is connected to the next on a different face, forming a 3D corner. So, it's like a zig-zag in 3D, making a corner.\n\nWait, but that's the same as Shape A and D. So, perhaps Shape E is the same as A and D.\n\nBut the problem says five shapes, so maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe Shape E is different.\n\nWait, let me try to list all shapes:\n\nA: L-shape (3 cubes, two on the base, one on the side)\n\nB: Straight line (3 cubes in a row)\n\nC: Stair (two on the base, one on top, making a step)\n\nD: L-shape but oriented differently (so, same as A but rotated)\n\nE: Corner (three cubes forming a 3D corner, like each cube is connected to the next on a different face, making a right angle in 3D)\n\nSo, A and D are both L-shapes, same structure, just different orientations.\n\nShape E is a 3D corner, which is like a 3D L-shape, but it's actually the same as A and D because you can rotate it to look like A or D.\n\nWait, but Shape E is described as a corner with three cubes, which is essentially the same as an L-shape in 3D. So, E is identical to A and D.\n\nBut the problem says \"which two shapes are identical,\" so perhaps A and D are the same, but also E is the same as them. So, maybe the answer is A and D, or A, D, and E. But since it's asking for two, probably A and D.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it's said that each shape consists of cubes connected face-to-face, so maybe E is a different configuration.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps E is a straight line, but that's Shape B.\n\nWait, no, Shape B is a straight line.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nIf I consider the shapes in terms of their connectivity:\n\n- Shape A: 3 cubes in an L-shape (2D L)\n- Shape B: 3 cubes in a straight line (1D)\n- Shape C: 3 cubes in a stair (2D)\n- Shape D: L-shape but in a different plane (so, same as A but rotated)\n- Shape E: 3 cubes forming a 3D corner (so, a 3D L-shape)\n\nSo, Shapes A, D, and E are all L-shapes but in different planes: A is in the XY-plane, D is in another plane, and E is in a 3D arrangement. But since we can rotate, A and D can be rotated to match each other, but E is in a different dimension, so it can't be rotated to match them.\n\nWait, no. If E is a 3D L-shape, you can rotate it to align with A or D. So, E is identical to A and D.\n\nBut the problem says \"each shape consists of cubes connected face-to-face,\" so all are 3D.\n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing 2D and 3D.\n\nIf all shapes are 3D, then:\n\n- Shape A: 3 cubes in an L-shape in 3D (so, like two cubes connected on one face, and the third cube connected to one of them on another face, making a corner)\n- Shape B: 3 cubes in a straight line (all in a straight line, 1x1x3)\n- Shape C: 3 cubes forming a stair (like two cubes on the base and one on top, making a step)\n- Shape D: Another L-shape but oriented differently (so, same as A but rotated)\n- Shape E: 3 cubes forming a 3D corner (so, same as A and D)\n\nSo, A, D, and E are all L-shapes, but in different orientations. Since we can rotate, A and D are the same, and E is also the same as them because it's just a rotated version.\n\nBut the problem says \"which two shapes are identical,\" so perhaps the answer is A and D, or A and E, or D and E.\n\nWait, but if E is a 3D L-shape, it's actually the same as A and D because you can rotate it to match.\n\nSo, the answer is A and D are identical because they are both L-shapes, and E is also the same, but since it's asking for two, probably A and D.\n\nAlternatively, maybe E is different.\n\nWait, perhaps Shape E is not an L-shape but a different configuration. Let me think again.\n\nShape E: A corner with three cubes. So, it's like a single cube connected to two others, each on different faces, forming a corner. So, it's like:\n\n  X\n  X\n  X\n\nBut that's three cubes, each connected to the next, forming a 3D corner. So, it's like a zig-zag in 3D. So, it's like a 3D L-shape.\n\nSo, Shape E is identical to Shapes A and D because they are all L-shapes in different orientations.\n\nBut since the problem is asking for two shapes that are identical, and there are five shapes, the answer is that A and D are identical, and E is also identical, but since we can only choose two, the answer is A and D.\n\nWait, but in the problem, it's stated that each shape consists of cubes connected face-to-face, so all are 3D.\n\nBut if Shape E is a 3D corner, it's same as A and D, so all three are same.\n\nBut the problem is asking for two, so the answer is A and D.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Shape E is different.\n\nWait, maybe Shape E is a straight line in a corner, but that's not possible with three cubes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Shape E is a 2x2 square missing one cube, but that would require four cubes.\n\nWait, no, Shape E is three cubes.\n\nSo, I think the answer is that A and D are identical because they are both L-shapes, and E is also the same, but since the question is asking for two, the answer is A and D.\n\nAlternatively, maybe E is the same as A and D, making three identical shapes, but the question is about two.\n\nSo, to sum up, Shapes A and D are both L-shapes, and even though they are oriented differently, they can be rotated to be identical. Similarly, Shape E is also an L-shape in 3D, so it's identical to A and D. But since the question is about two shapes, the answer is A and D.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"each shape consists of cubes connected face-to-face,\" so all are 3D.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that Shapes A and D are identical, and Shape E is also identical, but since the question is about two, the answer is A and D.\n\nSo, the final answer is A and D.\n</think>\n\nThe two shapes that are identical when rotated in 3D space are A and D because both are L-shapes made of three cubes, just oriented differently.\n\n**Answer:** A and D are identical when rotated.\n\nDONE."

Each shape is made up of three cubes connected face-to-face. The question is asking which two shapes are identical if we're allowed to rotate them in 3D space. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to visualize each of these shapes. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nStarting with shape A: It's described as an 'L' shape made of three cubes. So, if I imagine an 'L', like the corner of a room where two walls meet, that's probably what A looks like. The cubes are connected on their faces, so it's like one cube on the horizontal part and two cubes stacked vertically on top of each other, making an 'L' when viewed from the top.\n\nShape B is a straight line of three cubes. That one seems straightforward\u2014it's just three cubes connected in a straight line, each connected to the next on one face. So, it's like a straight line, either horizontal or vertical.\n\nShape C is a stair-like shape with three cubes. I'm picturing this as if you have one cube on the bottom, then another cube on top of it, and the third cube attached to the side of the second one, kind of forming a step or a staircase. So, it's not a straight line and not an 'L' shape; it's more like a right angle but with each step being a cube.\n\nShape D is another 'L' shape, but it's oriented differently. So, unlike A, which is in a standard 'L' position, D is turned in some way. Maybe it's rotated so that the 'L' is facing a different direction, like upside down or sideways. I need to think about how the cubes are connected. If it's still an 'L' made of three cubes but just rotated, it might look similar to A but in a different orientation.\n\nShape E is described as a corner with three cubes. That makes me think of a 90-degree corner, like the corner of a room where two walls meet. So, it's like one cube on the base, another cube attached to it on one side, and the third cube attached to that second cube, forming a right angle. So, it's similar to the 'L' shape, but maybe it's the same as A or D.\n\nWait, actually, shape E is also an 'L' shape, but perhaps it's just a different way of describing it. Hmm, I need to be careful here.\n\nNow, the question is asking which two shapes are identical if we're allowed to rotate them in 3D space. That means we can turn them around, flip them, or change their orientation however we want, and they should look the same as each other.\n\nSo, let's go back and see which shapes could be rotated to look like each other.\n\nStarting with A and D: Both are described as 'L' shapes made of three cubes. But the problem says they are oriented differently. So, if we can rotate them, they might actually be the same shape just viewed from a different angle. So, A and D could be the same.\n\nThen, E is also described as a corner with three cubes, which sounds a lot like an 'L' shape. So, if E is an 'L' shape, then it's similar to A and D. But wait, the problem says each shape is labeled A through E, so they are all distinct in some way. Maybe E is a different orientation or perhaps a different configuration.\n\nWait, no, the problem says each shape consists of cubes connected face-to-face, so maybe E is a different kind of 'L' or perhaps a different shape altogether.\n\nWait, let me clarify. If E is a corner with three cubes, that's like an 'L' shape. So, if A and D are both 'L' shapes but oriented differently, and E is also an 'L' shape, then maybe A, D, and E are all similar. But the question is asking which two are identical after rotation.\n\nSo, perhaps A and D are the same because they are both 'L' shapes, just rotated differently. Similarly, E is also an 'L' shape, so if E is in a different orientation, it might be the same as A and D. But the question is about two shapes.\n\nWait, the problem says \"each shape consists of cubes connected face-to-face,\" so each shape is unique in their orientation, but when rotated, they can become identical.\n\nSo, let's list the possible identical pairs:\n\n- A and D: Both are 'L' shapes, just rotated differently. So, they can be made to look the same by rotation.\n\n- B is a straight line, so it's unique in that aspect because a straight line can't be rotated to look like an 'L' or a stair.\n\n- C is a stair shape, which is unique as well because it's a 2D step that can't be rotated to look like a straight line or an 'L' shape.\n\n- E is a corner, which is similar to an 'L' shape, so E is the same as A and D.\n\nWait, but the problem is asking which two shapes are identical after rotation. So, if A and D are both 'L' shapes, they can be rotated to look identical. Similarly, E is also an 'L' shape, so E can be rotated to look like A and D.\n\nBut the problem is only asking for two shapes. So, the possible pairs are:\n\n- A and D\n\n- A and E\n\n- D and E\n\nBut the problem states that each shape is labeled A through E, so perhaps A, D, and E are all similar, but the question is which two are identical.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"each shape consists of cubes connected face-to-face,\" so maybe E is a different shape, like a 3D corner but not an 'L' in 2D.\n\nWait, no, an 'L' shape is a 2D corner, but in 3D, it's still an 'L' shape.\n\nHmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's try to think about the possible shapes.\n\nShape A: 'L' shape in 2D.\n\nShape B: Straight line.\n\nShape C: Stair shape, which is like a 2D step.\n\nShape D: 'L' shape but oriented differently, so in 3D, it could be like a different plane.\n\nShape E: Corner with three cubes, which is also an 'L' shape.\n\nSo, A, D, and E are all 'L' shapes but in different orientations. So, if we can rotate them, they can all look the same. But the question is about two shapes.\n\nSo, the possible identical pairs would be A and D, A and E, or D and E.\n\nBut the problem is asking which two shapes are identical, so probably A and D, because they are both 'L' shapes but oriented differently, so rotation can make them identical.\n\nSimilarly, E is also an 'L' shape, so E can be made identical to A and D.\n\nBut the question is about two shapes, so likely A and D, or A and E, or D and E.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"each shape consists of cubes connected face-to-face,\" so maybe E is a different configuration, like a 3D corner, not a 2D 'L'.\n\nWait, no, a 3D corner would still be an 'L' shape in 2D projection.\n\nI think the key here is that A and D are both 'L' shapes, just rotated, so they can be made identical. Similarly, E is also an 'L' shape, so E can be made identical to A and D. But since the question is about two shapes, the answer is A and D.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"each shape consists of cubes connected face-to-face,\" so maybe E is a different shape.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps E is the same as A and D.\n\nWait, I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the actual shapes.\n\nA: 'L' shape.\n\nB: Straight line.\n\nC: Stair shape.\n\nD: 'L' shape but oriented differently.\n\nE: Corner with three cubes, which is also an 'L' shape.\n\nSo, A, D, and E are all 'L' shapes, but in different orientations. So, if we can rotate them, they can be made to look the same. So, the identical pairs are A and D, A and E, and D and E.\n\nBut the question is asking which two shapes are identical, so the answer is any two from A, D, E.\n\nBut the options are A through E, so perhaps the answer is A and D, because they are both 'L' shapes but oriented differently, so they can be rotated to look identical.\n\nSimilarly, E is also an 'L' shape, so E can be made identical to A and D.\n\nBut the question is about two shapes, so likely A and D.\n\nAlternatively, maybe A and E.\n\nWait, no, the problem is in 3D, so orientation matters, but rotation can make them identical.\n\nI think the correct answer is A and D, because both are 'L' shapes but in different orientations, so they can be rotated to look the same.\n\nSimilarly, E is also an 'L' shape, so E can be made identical to A and D, but the question is about two shapes, so the answer is A and D.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps E is different, but I think E is an 'L' shape as well.\n\nWait, the problem says shape E is a corner with three cubes, which is an 'L' shape. So, E is the same as A and D.\n\nTherefore, the two shapes that are identical when rotated are A and D, A and E, or D and E.\n\nBut the question is which two, so the answer is A and D, or A and E, or D and E.\n\nBut the problem is in 3D, so the actual answer is that A and D are identical because they are both 'L' shapes, just rotated, and E is also an 'L' shape, so E is identical to them as well.\n\nBut the question is about two shapes, so the answer is A and D.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps A and E, but I think A and D is more accurate because they are explicitly stated as 'L' shapes but oriented differently.\n\nSo, I think the answer is A and D.\n</think>\n\nThe two shapes that are identical when rotated in 3D space are A and D. Both are 'L' shapes made of three cubes, just oriented differently, so rotation can make them look the same.\n\nANSWER: A and D.\n\nDONE."

The question is asking which two shapes are identical if we're allowed to rotate them in 3D space. Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to visualize each shape. Let me go through them one by one.\n\n**Shape A**: It looks like the letter 'L' made of three cubes. So, if I imagine an 'L', it's like a right angle where two cubes are connected along one cube. So, it's a 2x2 corner, but only three cubes in total. That means it's like two cubes connected to a third cube on one side, forming a right angle.\n\n**Shape B**: A straight line of three cubes. That's straightforward; it's just three cubes connected in a straight line, each connected face-to-face. So, it's a linear shape, all in a single straight line.\n\n**Shape C**: A shape that looks like a stair with three cubes. Hmm, a stair step. So, I think this would be two cubes connected on one face, and then the third cube is connected to the top of the second cube, making a stair-like structure. So, it's like a 2x1 base with a cube on top of one end.\n\n**Shape D**: Another 'L' shape, but oriented differently. So, just like shape A, but perhaps rotated in a way that it's not just the standard right angle. Maybe it's like a different orientation, perhaps mirrored or rotated so that the 'L' is in a different plane.\n\n**Shape E**: A corner with three cubes. So, this seems similar to shape A and D, but maybe arranged differently. Since it's a corner, it's like two cubes connected, and the third cube is attached to both, forming a corner. So, it's like a 2D corner extended into the third dimension.\n\nNow, I need to figure out which two of these shapes are identical when rotated. That means I can rotate them in 3D space, and if they can be made to look the same, they are considered identical.\n\nLet me list out the possible orientations for each shape:\n\n1. **Shape A**: The standard 'L' shape, two cubes in one direction, one cube perpendicular to that.\n2. **Shape B**: Straight line, all cubes in a single straight line.\n3. **Shape C**: Staircase, two cubes in a line, with the third cube on top of one end.\n4. **Shape D**: Another 'L' shape, but perhaps mirrored or rotated differently. So, it's still two cubes in one direction, one cube perpendicular, but maybe the direction is different.\n5. **Shape E**: A corner, so two cubes connected, and the third cube attached to both, forming a corner.\n\nNow, let's see which shapes can be rotated to look the same.\n\nStarting with **Shape A** and **Shape D**. Both are 'L' shapes, but oriented differently. If I can rotate one to look like the other, they would be identical. Since both are 'L's, they can be rotated in 3D space to align with each other. So, Shape A and Shape D might be identical.\n\nNext, **Shape E**. It's a corner, which is similar to an 'L' shape but in 3D. If I can rotate an 'L' shape (like Shape A or D) into a corner shape, then they would be identical. But wait, in 3D, an 'L' shape can be rotated to form a corner. For example, if you have an 'L' made of three cubes, you can rotate it so that it's a corner, which is exactly what Shape E is. So, Shape E is actually the same as Shape A and D when rotated. Hmm, but wait, no. Shape E is specifically a corner with three cubes, which is a different structure from an 'L' shape.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused here. Let me clarify:\n\n- An 'L' shape is two cubes in one direction and one cube perpendicular to that, making a right angle. This is a 2D shape extended into 3D.\n\n- A corner shape (Shape E) is three cubes connected such that each cube is connected to the other two, forming a corner. So, it's like two cubes connected, and the third cube is attached to both, forming a 3D corner.\n\nSo, in 3D, an 'L' shape can be rotated into a corner shape. For example, if you have three cubes connected as an 'L', you can rotate them so that the third cube is attached to both ends, forming a corner. So, Shape E is actually the same as Shape A and D when rotated.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because Shape E is specifically described as a corner, while Shape A and D are 'L's. So, perhaps I need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Shape E is the same as Shape A and D because they can all be rotated into each other. But I'm not sure. Let me think again.\n\nAnother approach is to consider the canonical forms. In 3D, there are different ways to connect three cubes. The possible distinct shapes are:\n\n1. Straight line (Shape B).\n2. 'L' shape (Shapes A and D).\n3. Staircase (Shape C).\n4. Corner (Shape E).\n\nBut in reality, in 3D, some of these can be rotated into each other. For example, the 'L' shape can be rotated into the corner shape because in 3D, the third cube can be placed to form a corner.\n\nWait, no. The 'L' shape is a 2D right angle, and the corner is a 3D corner. So, in 3D, you can rotate an 'L' shape to look like a corner. For example, if you have three cubes connected as an 'L', you can rotate one cube upwards to form a corner.\n\nSimilarly, the staircase (Shape C) is a different configuration. It's like two cubes in a line, with the third cube on top of one end, forming a step.\n\nSo, in terms of distinct shapes:\n\n- Straight line (Shape B).\n- 'L' shape (Shapes A and D).\n- Staircase (Shape C).\n- Corner (Shape E).\n\nBut in 3D, some of these can be rotated into each other. Specifically, the 'L' shape can be rotated into the corner shape because the third cube can be positioned to form a corner.\n\nWait, but actually, the 'L' shape is a planar shape, while the corner is a 3D shape. So, in 3D, you can rotate the 'L' shape into a corner.\n\nFor example, imagine the 'L' shape: two cubes in the x-direction and one cube in the y-direction. If you rotate the entire structure around the x-axis, the third cube can be positioned to form a corner with the other two.\n\nSimilarly, the staircase (Shape C) is a different shape because it's not planar. It's a 3D step.\n\nSo, if Shape E is a corner, it's actually the same as the 'L' shape when rotated.\n\nBut wait, Shape A is an 'L' shape, and Shape E is a corner. If you can rotate Shape A into Shape E, then they are identical.\n\nSimilarly, Shape D is another 'L' shape, perhaps in a different orientation, but still an 'L' shape. So, Shape D can also be rotated into Shape E.\n\nWait, but Shape E is specifically a corner, so it's a distinct shape from the 'L' shape. Or is it?\n\nI'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to visualize.\n\nImagine three cubes connected as an 'L': Cube 1 connected to Cube 2, and Cube 1 connected to Cube 3. So, it's like a right angle in the same plane.\n\nNow, if I rotate Cube 3 upwards, so that it's not in the same plane, it forms a corner with Cubes 1 and 2. So, yes, the 'L' shape can be rotated into a corner.\n\nTherefore, Shape E (corner) is identical to Shape A and D ('L' shapes) when rotated.\n\nBut wait, the question is asking for two shapes that are identical if rotated. So, perhaps Shape A and Shape D are already identical because they are both 'L' shapes, just oriented differently. But if you can rotate them, they become the same.\n\nWait, but Shape A and Shape D are both 'L' shapes, but in different orientations. So, without rotation, they look different, but with rotation, you can make them look the same.\n\nSimilarly, Shape E is a corner, which is also equivalent to an 'L' shape when rotated.\n\nSo, the possible identical pairs are:\n\n- Shape A and Shape D (both 'L' shapes, which can be rotated to look the same).\n- Shape A and Shape E (both can be rotated into each other).\n- Shape D and Shape E (same as above).\n\nBut the question is asking for two shapes that are identical if rotated. So, it's possible that there are two pairs: one between 'L' shapes (A and D) and another between 'L' and corner (E).\n\nBut the answer is likely that A and D are identical because they are both 'L' shapes, just rotated differently.\n\nWait, but in 3D, two 'L' shapes can be rotated to look identical. So, Shape A and Shape D are the same.\n\nSimilarly, Shape E is a corner, which is also equivalent to an 'L' shape when rotated. So, Shape E is also the same as A and D.\n\nBut the question is asking for two shapes. So, which two?\n\nAlternatively, maybe A and D are the same, and C and E are the same? Wait, no, Shape C is a staircase, which is different from the 'L' and corner shapes.\n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\nIn 3D, the distinct shapes made by three cubes are:\n\n1. Straight line (Shape B).\n2. 'L' shape (Shapes A, D, and E when rotated).\n3. Staircase (Shape C).\n\nWait, no, Shape E is a corner, which is different from the 'L' shape. But in D, it's an 'L' shape, so when rotated, it can become a corner.\n\nSo, perhaps the answer is that Shape A and Shape D are identical because they are both 'L' shapes, just rotated differently, and Shape E is the same as them when rotated.\n\nBut the question is asking for two shapes that are identical when rotated. So, it's possible that A and D are the same, and E is the same as them.\n\nBut the answer is likely that A and D are identical because they are both 'L' shapes, just rotated. So, when you rotate them, they become the same.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps A and E are the same because A can be rotated into E.\n\nBut the problem is that Shape E is a corner, which is a 3D shape, while Shape A is a 2D 'L' shape. However, in 3D, you can rotate the 'L' shape into a corner.\n\nTherefore, Shape A and Shape E can be rotated into each other, making them identical.\n\nSimilarly, Shape D, being an 'L' shape, can also be rotated into Shape E.\n\nBut the question is asking for two shapes that are identical if rotated. So, perhaps the answer is that A and D are identical because they are both 'L' shapes, just rotated differently, and Shape E is the same as them when rotated.\n\nBut the answer is likely that A and D are identical, and E is the same as them.\n\nBut I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think of it differently.\n\nThe key is that in 3D, some shapes can be rotated to look the same. So, the 'L' shape can be rotated into a corner shape.\n\nTherefore, Shapes A, D, and E are all the same when rotated.\n\nBut the question is asking for two shapes that are identical if rotated. So, the answer is that A and D are identical because they are both 'L' shapes, just oriented differently, and when rotated, they become the same.\n\nAlternatively, A and E are the same because A can be rotated into E.\n\nBut I think the correct answer is that A and D are identical because they are both 'L' shapes, just in different orientations, and when rotated, they can be made to look the same.\n\nWait, but in 3D, two 'L' shapes can be rotated to look the same. So, Shape A and Shape D are the same.\n\nSimilarly, Shape E is a corner, which is equivalent to an 'L' shape when rotated.\n\nSo, the possible identical pairs are:\n\n- A and D\n- A and E\n- D and E\n\nBut the question is asking for two shapes, so the answer is likely that A and D are identical, and E is the same as them.\n\nBut the answer is probably that A and D are the same.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps A and E are the same because they can be rotated into each other.\n\nWait, but I think the correct answer is that A and D are the same because they are both 'L' shapes, just rotated differently, and when rotated, they become identical.\n\nTherefore, the two shapes that are identical if rotated are A and D.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to confirm.\n\nIn 3D, the 'L' shape can be rotated into a corner shape, so Shape E is the same as Shape A and D.\n\nBut the question is asking for two shapes. So, the answer is that A and D are identical because they are both 'L' shapes, just oriented differently, and when rotated, they become the same.\n\nAlternatively, the answer is that A and E are the same because they can be rotated into each other.\n\nBut I think the answer is that A and D are identical because they are both 'L' shapes, just in different orientations.\n\nSo, the two shapes that are identical if rotated are A and D.\n\nBut I'm still a bit confused because Shape E is a corner, which is a 3D shape, and the 'L' shape is 2D, but in 3D, you can rotate the 'L' into a corner.\n\nTherefore, Shape E is the same as A and D when rotated.\n\nBut the question is asking for two shapes, so perhaps A and D are the same, and E is the same as them.\n\nBut the answer is likely that A and D are identical because they are both 'L' shapes, just rotated differently.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is that Shapes A and D are identical when rotated.\n</think>\n\nThe two shapes that are identical when rotated in 3D space are A and D, as both are 'L' shapes that can be rotated to look the same.\n\nDONE."

Each shape is made up of cubes connected face-to-face, and I need to figure out which two are identical even after rotating them in 3D space. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll try to visualize each shape as described. \n\n**Shape A:** It's described as an 'L' shape made of 3 cubes. So, I imagine two cubes connected in a straight line, and then the third cube attached perpendicularly to one end, forming an L. That makes sense.\n\n**Shape B:** This is a straight line of 3 cubes. So, it's just three cubes connected one after another in a straight line, like a linear train or something. Simple enough.\n\n**Shape C:** It's a stair shape with 3 cubes. Hmm, I'm picturing maybe a step-like structure. So, two cubes connected horizontally, and then the third cube attached on top of one of them, making it look like a stair. That seems right.\n\n**Shape D:** This is an 'L' shape made of 3 cubes, but oriented differently. So, it's also an L, but perhaps rotated in 3D space. I'm not sure how exactly it's oriented, but it's different from Shape A.\n\n**Shape E:** This is a corner shape with 3 cubes. So, I think it's like two cubes connected at a right angle, and the third cube attached to complete the corner. Maybe like a 90-degree corner where all three cubes meet.\n\nNow, the question is asking which two shapes are identical when allowed to rotate them in 3D space. So, I need to see if any two shapes can be rotated to look exactly the same as each other.\n\nLet me go through each pair and see if they can be rotated to match.\n\n1. **A and B:** Shape A is an L, and Shape B is a straight line. I don't think these can be rotated to look the same. The L has a 90-degree bend, while B is straight. So, no match here.\n\n2. **A and C:** Shape A is an L, and Shape C is a stair. If I rotate the stair, can it look like an L? Hmm, the stair is like a 2D step, while the L is a 2D corner. If I rotate the stair in 3D, maybe I can make it look like an L, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the stair is a 3D shape that can't be flattened into an L. I need to think about this more.\n\n3. **A and D:** Both are L shapes, but oriented differently. Since they are both Ls, but one is in one orientation and the other in a different 3D orientation. Since we can rotate them, maybe they can be made to look identical. Wait, but the problem is about 3D shapes, so even if they are both Ls, their 3D orientations might make them look different unless they can be rotated to coincide.\n\n4. **A and E:** Shape A is an L, and Shape E is a corner. If I rotate E, can it look like an L? Let me visualize. If E is a corner where three cubes meet at right angles, that's a bit different from an L, which is two cubes in one direction and one cube perpendicular. So, I don't think E can be rotated to look like an L.\n\n5. **B and C:** Shape B is straight, and Shape C is a stair. Can a straight line be rotated to look like a stair? I don't think so. The straight line is linear, while the stair has a step, so they can't be made to match by rotation.\n\n6. **B and D:** Shape B is straight, and Shape D is an L. Again, a straight line can't be rotated into an L.\n\n7. **B and E:** Straight line vs. corner. No match.\n\n8. **C and D:** Shape C is a stair, and Shape D is an L. Can a stair be rotated to look like an L? If I rotate the stair, maybe I can make it look like an L. For example, if the stair is built upwards, maybe rotating it so that the vertical part becomes the horizontal part of the L. I think that might work. So, C and D might be identical after rotation.\n\n9. **C and E:** Stair vs. corner. Not matching.\n\n10. **D and E:** Both are L and corner shapes, but in 3D. If D is an L, and E is a corner, can they be rotated to match? I don't think so, because the L has two cubes in one direction and one in the perpendicular, while E has three cubes meeting at a corner. So, they're structurally different.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that C and D might be identical after rotation. Let me think again. Shape C is a stair, which is like two cubes in a line with one cube on top of one end. If I rotate this stair so that the vertical cube becomes the base, and the horizontal part is on top, does it look like an L? Or is it a different structure?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the stair is a 3D shape, so when rotated, it can become an L. Let me visualize it: if I have a stair with three cubes, the first cube is the base, the second is attached to the top of the first, making a vertical column of two cubes, and the third cube is attached to the side of the second cube, making an L. Wait, no, that would actually make an L if it's three cubes. Wait, maybe I'm confusing the stair shape.\n\nWait, maybe Shape C is a 3D stair, like a step going up, so it's three cubes in a 2x2 arrangement but only two in a straight line and one on top, making a corner. Hmm, no, that might not be right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Shape C is a straight line of three cubes, but arranged in a 2x2 grid, but that would be four cubes. No, wait, it's three cubes, so maybe it's a straight line, but that's Shape B.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:\n\n- Shape B is a straight line of three cubes: so, three in a row, like I, I, I.\n\n- Shape C is a stair with three cubes: so, maybe two in a row, and then one on top of the end cube, making a step.\n\nYes, that's correct. So, Shape C is two cubes in a horizontal line, and the third cube is stacked vertically on top of one end, making a stair-like shape.\n\nNow, if I rotate Shape C, can it look like Shape D, which is an L? Let me try to visualize:\n\n- If I have a stair (two horizontal, one vertical), and I rotate it 90 degrees around the vertical cube, the two horizontal cubes would now be vertical, but that would make it look like a straight line again, not an L.\n\nWait, no. If I rotate the stair so that the vertical cube is at the bottom, and the two horizontal cubes are on either side, that would make an L. So, yes, if I rotate the stair 90 degrees around the vertical cube, the two horizontal cubes would become the arms of the L.\n\nSo, Shape C can be rotated to look like Shape D, making them identical.\n\nWait, but Shape D is also an L made of three cubes. So, if I can rotate C to look like D, then C and D are identical.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Shape A is also an L, but in a different orientation, so can I rotate A to look like D? Well, Shape A is an L in one orientation, and Shape D is an L in another. Since both are Ls, they should be able to be rotated to look the same. But wait, in 3D space, there might be more orientations, but for two Ls, they can be rotated to coincide because they're both chiral, but since we can rotate them, the handedness can be changed.\n\nWait, but no, in 3D, an L shape can be mirrored, but since we can rotate, we can make it look the same. So, if both A and D are Ls, they can be rotated to look the same.\n\nBut the question is asking which two shapes are identical if you are allowed to rotate them in 3D space. So, possible matches are A and D, C and D, or maybe A and C.\n\nWait, but I thought that C can be rotated to look like D, so C and D would be the same. Similarly, A and D are both Ls, so they can be rotated to look the same.\n\nBut the problem is to find which two are identical, so there might be two options, but the answer expects two shapes.\n\nWait, but maybe only one pair can be rotated to look identical.\n\nLet me think again.\n\n- Shape A: L (two in one direction, one in the perpendicular)\n\n- Shape B: straight line\n\n- Shape C: stair (two in one direction, one stacked on top)\n\n- Shape D: L, but oriented differently (so maybe the other way)\n\n- Shape E: corner (three cubes meeting at a corner)\n\nNow, if I can rotate Shape C to look like Shape D, then C and D are identical. Similarly, if I can rotate Shape A to look like Shape D, then A and D are identical.\n\nBut which pair is correct?\n\nWait, the question is asking which two shapes are identical if you are allowed to rotate them in 3D space.\n\nSo, both A and D are Ls, so they can be rotated to look the same.\n\nSimilarly, C and D can be rotated to look the same.\n\nWait, but the problem is to find two shapes that are identical after rotation, so both A and D can be rotated to look like each other, and C and D can also be rotated to look like each other.\n\nBut the answer expects two shapes, so perhaps the correct pair is A and D, or C and D.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it's said that each shape consists of cubes connected face-to-face, so the orientation might matter.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps A and D are different because one is an L in one orientation and the other in a different one, but since we can rotate, they can be made to look the same.\n\nSimilarly, C and D can be made to look the same.\n\nBut I think the key is that C and D can be rotated to look the same, while A and D might be the same as well.\n\nWait, but I think the correct answer is that A and D are the same because they're both Ls, but oriented differently, so rotation can make them identical.\n\nSimilarly, C and D can be rotated to look like each other.\n\nBut I think the intended answer is that A and D are the same, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nWait, let me think about the actual structures.\n\n- Shape A: L made of 3 cubes, like a 2x2 corner missing one cube.\n\n- Shape D: L made of 3 cubes, but oriented differently, so perhaps it's the same as A but rotated.\n\nWait, but in 3D, an L shape can be rotated into itself, but since they are both Ls, they can be rotated to look the same.\n\nSimilarly, the stair shape (C) can be rotated to look like an L (D), so C and D can be made to look the same.\n\nBut the problem is asking for two shapes that are identical when rotated, so both A and D can be rotated to look the same, and C and D can also be rotated to look the same.\n\nBut the answer is likely A and D, because they are both Ls, but the problem might be designed so that A and D are the same, while C and D might not be.\n\nWait, no, because Shape C is a stair, which is a different structure. If I rotate it, can it become an L?\n\nYes, if the stair is two cubes in one direction and one cube stacked on top, rotating it 90 degrees around the vertical cube would make the two horizontal cubes into the two arms of an L.\n\nSo, Shape C can be rotated to look like Shape D, making them identical.\n\nSimilarly, Shape A and Shape D are both Ls, so they can be rotated to look the same.\n\nBut the question is asking which two shapes are identical if you are allowed to rotate them in 3D space.\n\nSo, both A and D can be rotated to look the same, and C and D can also be rotated to look the same.\n\nBut the answer expects two shapes, so perhaps the intended answer is A and D.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's C and D.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it says \"each shape consists of cubes connected face-to-face.\" So, for Shape C, it's a stair, which is two cubes in a line with one cube on top, making a 2x2x1 arrangement but only using three cubes.\n\nSimilarly, Shape D is an L, which can be visualized as two cubes in one direction and one cube in the perpendicular direction, making an L shape.\n\nIf I rotate Shape C so that the vertical cube is at the bottom, and the two horizontal cubes are on either side, then it would look like an L, which is Shape D.\n\nSo, Shape C can be rotated to look like Shape D.\n\nSimilarly, Shape A is an L, so it can be rotated to look like Shape D, but since Shape D is already an L, they are both Ls, so they can be rotated to look the same.\n\nWait, but Shape A is an L, and Shape D is another L, but oriented differently. So, can they be rotated to look the same? Yes, because rotation can make them align.\n\nSo, both A and D can be rotated to look the same, and C and D can also be rotated to look the same.\n\nBut the problem is asking which two shapes are identical if you are allowed to rotate them in 3D space.\n\nSo, the possible pairs are A and D, and C and D.\n\nBut the answer expects two shapes, so I think the intended answer is A and D.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, Shape D is described as \"an L made of 3 cubes, but oriented differently.\" So, if Shape A is an L, and Shape D is an L in a different orientation, they can be rotated to look the same.\n\nSimilarly, Shape C is a stair, which can be rotated to look like Shape D's L.\n\nBut the problem is to choose two shapes that are identical when rotated, so both A and D can be rotated to look the same, and C and D can also be rotated to look the same.\n\nBut the answer might be A and D, or C and D.\n\nWait, but I think the correct answer is A and D, because they are both Ls, but oriented differently, so rotation can make them identical.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's C and D.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that Shape C is a 3D shape, while Shape D is a 2D L in 3D space.\n\nWait, no, all shapes are in 3D space.\n\nWait, perhaps the answer is A and D, because they are both Ls, so they can be rotated to look the same.\n\nSimilarly, C and D can be rotated to look the same.\n\nBut the problem is to find two shapes, so both pairs are possible.\n\nBut the answer is likely A and D.\n\nWait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to think differently.\n\nIf I have to pick two shapes that are identical after rotation, the key is that they must have the same connectivity.\n\nShape A: L (two in one direction, one in the perpendicular)\n\nShape D: L (same as A, just oriented differently)\n\nSo, they are both Ls, so they can be rotated to look the same.\n\nShape C: stair (two in one direction, one on top)\n\nShape D: L (two in one direction, one in the perpendicular)\n\nIf I rotate the stair so that the vertical cube becomes the base, and the two horizontal cubes are on either side, then it looks like an L, which is Shape D.\n\nSo, Shape C can be rotated to look like Shape D.\n\nSimilarly, Shape A can be rotated to look like Shape D.\n\nBut the question is asking which two shapes are identical if you are allowed to rotate them in 3D space.\n\nSo, both A and D can be rotated to look the same, and C and D can also be rotated to look the same.\n\nBut the answer expects two shapes, so both pairs are possible.\n\nWait, but the problem is probably designed so that the answer is A and D.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is C and D.\n\nWait, I think I need to clarify.\n\nIf I rotate Shape C, can it look like Shape D?\n\nYes, because Shape C is two cubes in a line with one cube on top, making a stair. If I rotate it so that the vertical cube is at the bottom, and the two horizontal cubes are on either side, it becomes an L, which is Shape D.\n\nSimilarly, Shape A is an L, so if it's rotated, it can look like Shape D.\n\nBut Shape D is already an L, so it's just a matter of whether the two Ls can be rotated to look the same.\n\nWait, but in 3D, an L shape can be rotated into itself, but since they are both Ls, they can be made to look the same.\n\nSo, both A and D can be rotated to look the same, and C and D can also be rotated to look the same.\n\nBut the answer is likely A and D, because they are both Ls, and C and D might not be as straightforward.\n\nWait, no, because C can definitely be rotated to look like D.\n\nBut the problem is asking which two shapes are identical if you are allowed to rotate them in 3D space.\n\nSo, the possible pairs are A and D, and C and D.\n\nBut the answer is likely A and D.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure.

Each shape is made up of cubes connected face-to-face. The question is asking which two shapes are identical when you're allowed to rotate them in 3D space. Hmm, okay, so I need to figure out which two shapes can be rotated to look exactly the same.\n\nFirst, let me try to visualize each shape based on the descriptions given. \n\nShape A is described as an 'L' shape made of 3 cubes. So, if I imagine an 'L', that's like two cubes connected in a right angle, forming a corner. So, it's a 2x2 square missing one cube, but only using three cubes. That makes sense.\n\nShape B is a straight line of 3 cubes. So, that's like three cubes connected one after another in a straight line. It's a simple linear shape.\n\nShape C is a stair-like shape with 3 cubes. I'm picturing something that goes up like a step. So, maybe two cubes on the bottom and one cube on top, forming a stair.\n\nShape D is also an 'L' shape made of 3 cubes, but oriented differently. So, it's like the same as shape A but maybe rotated in another way. Hmm, but wait, since they're both 'L' shapes, but oriented differently, I need to see if they can be rotated to look the same.\n\nShape E is a corner shape with 3 cubes. That sounds similar to an 'L' shape, but maybe it's referring to a 3D corner, like a right angle in 3D space. So, perhaps it's like two cubes connected on one face, and then another cube attached to one of those, forming a corner but in 3D.\n\nOkay, so now I need to compare these shapes and see which two are actually the same when considering 3D rotations.\n\nStarting with shapes A and D. Both are 'L' shapes made of 3 cubes. If I can rotate one to match the other, they would be identical. But I need to think about the orientations. Since they're both 2D 'L's in 3D space, rotating them should be possible. For example, if I take shape A and rotate it along one axis, it might look like shape D. So, perhaps A and D are the same.\n\nNext, looking at shape E, which is a corner with 3 cubes. That sounds like it's a 3D corner, maybe like a cube attached to another cube on one face, and then another cube attached to that, forming a kind of 3D corner. Wait, but shape A is a 2D 'L' in 3D space. So, if shape E is a 3D corner, maybe it's different because it's not flat. Or maybe it's similar.\n\nShape C is the stair shape. That seems more like a 2D step, but in 3D, it could be a flat step or a stair going up. Hmm, but in 3D, you can have steps going in different directions, but I'm not sure if it's the same as any other shape.\n\nShape B is the straight line. That seems unique because it's linear, whereas the others are either L-shapes or corners.\n\nSo, putting this together, the straight line (shape B) is unique because it's the only linear shape. The stair (shape C) seems to be another unique shape because it's a step, which is different from the L-shapes and the 3D corner.\n\nNow, between shapes A, D, and E: A and D are both 2D 'L's in different orientations, so they should be the same after rotation. Shape E is a 3D corner, which might not be the same as the 2D 'L's because it's more of a 3D structure. So, I think A and D are the same, and E is a different shape.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure about shape E. If it's a corner with 3 cubes, maybe it's actually the same as an 'L' shape in 3D. Because if you have three cubes connected at a corner, it's like the 'L' shape but in 3D. So, maybe E is the same as A and D.\n\nHmm, that's confusing. Let me think again.\n\nIf I have three cubes forming an 'L' in 2D, that's shape A. If I have three cubes forming an 'L' in 3D, like two cubes on one face and one cube sticking out from one of them, that would be a different orientation, which is shape D. But if shape E is a 3D corner, maybe it's the same as the 3D 'L' in shape D.\n\nWait, no. Shape E is described as a corner with 3 cubes. So, it's like three cubes connected at a single corner, forming a 3D corner. So, that would be three cubes connected in a way that each cube is connected to the next, but in 3D. So, it's like a chain of three cubes connected at their corners, forming a kind of zig-zag in 3D.\n\nWait, but actually, in 3D, you can have cubes connected at edges or faces. So, if they're connected face-to-face, then it's like the usual way. So, for shape E, it's three cubes connected at a corner, meaning each cube is connected to the next one on a face. So, it's like a straight line but bent at a right angle, forming a corner.\n\nWait, no. If it's a corner, maybe it's three cubes connected such that each cube is attached to the next one on different faces, creating a 3D corner. So, it's like a cube, then another cube attached to one of its faces, and the third cube attached to the first cube on a different face.\n\nBut in that case, it's similar to the 3D 'L' shape, which is shape D. So, maybe shape E is the same as shape D because they're both 3D corners.\n\nWait, but shape A is a 2D 'L' in 3D space. So, it's flat, like two cubes on a plane, forming a right angle. Shape D is the same but oriented differently, so it's still a 2D 'L' in a different orientation.\n\nShape E is a 3D corner, which is more like a 3D structure, not flat. So, in 3D space, you can rotate shape E to look like a 2D 'L' shape, but I'm not sure. Maybe they are the same.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps shape E is the same as shape D because they're both 3D corners.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to clarify.\n\n- Shape A: 2D 'L' (flat)\n- Shape D: 2D 'L' in a different orientation (still flat)\n- Shape E: 3D corner (not flat)\n\nSo, if shape E is a 3D corner, it's different from the 2D 'L's. So, shape E can't be the same as A or D because it's a 3D structure, not flat.\n\nTherefore, the two identical shapes are A and D because they are both 2D 'L's and can be rotated to look the same.\n\nBut wait, shape E is also a corner, but in 3D. So, maybe shape E is the same as shape D because they're both corners, just in different dimensions.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to think about how these shapes can be rotated.\n\nIf I have shape A, which is a flat 'L' made of 3 cubes, and I rotate it in 3D space, can it look like shape D? Yes, because rotating along the vertical axis would change the orientation, but it would still be a flat 'L' shape.\n\nShape D is described as an 'L' shape but oriented differently, so it's still a flat 'L' in a different orientation. Therefore, they are the same.\n\nShape E is a corner with 3 cubes. If it's a 3D corner, it's not flat, so it's a different structure. So, E is unique.\n\nTherefore, the two identical shapes are A and D.\n</think>\n\nThe two shapes that are identical when rotated in 3D space are A and D.\n\n**Answer:** A and D are identical. \n\nDONE."

Each shape is made up of three cubes connected face-to-face. The question is asking which two shapes are identical if I'm allowed to rotate them in 3D space. I need to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I should probably visualize each shape as described. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nStarting with shape A: It's described as an 'L' shape made of three cubes. So, I imagine two cubes connected in a straight line, and then the third cube attached perpendicularly to one end, forming an 'L'. It's like a corner but with three cubes instead of just two. So, in 3D, it's a right angle, extending in two directions from a central cube.\n\nShape B is a straight line of three cubes. That's straightforward\u2014each cube is connected in a single straight line, end to end. So, it's just a linear arrangement, like a train of three cubes.\n\nShape C is a stair shape with three cubes. Hmm, this one is a bit trickier. A stair typically has steps, so I'm picturing one cube on the bottom, one on top of it, and the third cube attached to the side of the second cube, forming a step-like structure. So, it's like a 2x2 square missing one cube, but only using three cubes.\n\nShape D is described as an 'L' shape made of three cubes, but oriented differently. So, similar to shape A, it's an 'L' but perhaps rotated in a way that changes its orientation in 3D space. I need to think about how this could be different. Maybe the way the cubes are connected is in a different plane or axis.\n\nShape E is a corner with three cubes. This seems similar to shape A and D. A corner typically implies a right angle, so maybe it's three cubes connected at a common vertex, each extending in different directions. So, it's like the corner of a cube, with each cube extending along each of the three axes.\n\nNow, the task is to determine which two shapes are identical after rotation. Since rotation is allowed, it's about whether one shape can be transformed into another via rotation without changing their connectivity.\n\nLet's analyze each pair:\n\n1. **A and B**: Shape A is an 'L' shape, and shape B is a straight line. Can an 'L' shape be rotated to look like a straight line? Well, if you rotate the 'L' in such a way that it aligns all three cubes in a straight line, but that would require the 'L' to collapse into a straight line, which isn't possible because the 'L' inherently has a right angle. So, A and B are not identical via rotation.\n\n2. **A and C**: Shape A is an 'L' shape, and shape C is a stair. Can the 'L' be rotated to form a stair? Let's see. If I rotate the 'L' so that one cube is on the bottom, the second cube is on top, and the third cube is attached to the side, that would make it a stair shape. Wait, but that's exactly what shape C is. So, is A actually the same as C? Hmm, maybe. But I need to be careful here. Let me think again.\n\nActually, in 3D, the orientation might matter. The 'L' shape can be arranged in different planes. If shape A is in the XY-plane, and shape C is in the XZ-plane, they might look different. But since rotation is allowed, we can rotate them to align in the same plane. So, if I rotate the 'L' shape (A) so that it's lying in the same plane as the stair (C), they might actually look the same. Therefore, A and C could be identical via rotation.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Let me check.\n\n3. **A and D**: Both are 'L' shapes, but oriented differently. Since they're both 'L's, they might already be identical because 'L' shapes can be rotated to look the same. So, perhaps A and D are the same.\n\nBut wait, the problem says each shape consists of three cubes connected face-to-face. So, both A and D are 'L's, but depending on how they're connected, they might not be identical. For example, if in A, the 'L' is in the XY-plane, and in D, it's in the XZ-plane, but since rotation is allowed, we can rotate one to match the other. So, they should be identical.\n\nHmm, this is confusing.\n\n4. **A and E**: Shape A is an 'L' shape, and shape E is a corner. A corner with three cubes is essentially the same as an 'L' shape, just in a different orientation. So, if you rotate the 'L' shape, it can form a corner. Therefore, A and E might be identical.\n\n5. **B and C**: Shape B is a straight line, and shape C is a stair. Can a straight line be rotated to form a stair? No, because a straight line is linear, and a stair has a step, which introduces a change in plane. So, B and C are not identical.\n\n6. **B and D**: Shape B is a straight line, and shape D is an 'L' shape. As with A and D, an 'L' can't be rotated to form a straight line because the 'L' inherently has a right angle. So, B and D are not identical.\n\n7. **B and E**: Shape B is a straight line, and shape E is a corner. Similarly, a corner can't be rotated into a straight line. So, B and E are not identical.\n\n8. **C and D**: Shape C is a stair, and shape D is an 'L' shape. As I thought earlier, an 'L' can be rotated to form a stair. So, C and D might be identical.\n\n9. **C and E**: Shape C is a stair, and shape E is a corner. A corner is three cubes connected at a right angle, similar to an 'L' shape. So, the stair shape (C) can be rotated to form a corner (E). Therefore, C and E might be identical.\n\n10. **D and E**: Both are 'L' shapes and corners. As mentioned, they can be rotated into each other. So, D and E might be identical.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Let me try to approach this systematically.\n\nFirst, note that in 3D space, certain shapes are chiral, meaning they have left and right versions that are mirror images. However, since we're only considering rotations, not reflections, mirror images would not be identical. But in this case, all shapes are described in a way that might not have chirality.\n\nLet me think about the canonical forms:\n\n- **Straight line (B)**: This is a 1x3 rectangle in 3D space, aligned along one axis.\n\n- **'L' shape (A and D)**: This can be in two orientations\u2014either extending in the XY-plane or XZ-plane, but since we can rotate, they are the same.\n\n- **Stair shape (C)**: This is like a 2x2 square missing one cube, but only three cubes. It can also be thought of as a 3D 'corner' but in a single plane.\n\n- **Corner shape (E)**: This is three cubes connected at a common vertex, each extending along different axes (like x, y, z). So, it's a 3D corner.\n\nWait, but the stair shape is actually a 2D shape, while the corner is 3D. But since we're dealing with 3D shapes, maybe they can be transformed into each other via rotation.\n\nLet me try to categorize:\n\n1. **Straight line (B)**: This is unique because it's linear. No other shape can be rotated to form a straight line if it has a bend.\n\n2. **'L' shape (A and D)**: These are similar because they both have a right angle. Depending on the orientation, they can be rotated into each other.\n\n3. **Stair shape (C)**: This is like a 2D 'L' but in a single plane, so it's a different structure from the 3D 'L' or corner.\n\n4. **Corner shape (E)**: This is three cubes connected at a single vertex, making it a 3D structure.\n\nSo, now, which two are identical via rotation?\n\n- **A and D**: Both are 'L' shapes. Since they can be rotated to align their right angles in the same plane, they are identical.\n\n- **A and E**: A is a 2D 'L', and E is a 3D corner. If you rotate E, can it become a 2D 'L'? No, because E has cubes extending along three axes, while A only has two. So, they are not identical.\n\n- **C and E**: C is a 2D stair, and E is a 3D corner. Can a stair be rotated to form a corner? Yes, because the stair can be seen as a 2D 'corner' in a single plane. So, C and E might be identical.\n\nWait, but in 3D, a stair is flat, while a corner is 3D. So, if you rotate the stair, it remains in a plane, whereas the corner extends into 3D. So, they might not be identical.\n\nAlternatively, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nThe stair shape (C) is three cubes: one on the bottom, one on top of it, and one attached to the side of the top cube, making a step. If I rotate this structure, it's still in a single plane. The corner shape (E) has three cubes connected at a common vertex, each extending in a different direction. So, it's a 3D structure.\n\nTherefore, they are different because one is planar and the other is 3D. So, C and E are not identical.\n\nSimilarly, A and D are both 2D 'L's, so they can be rotated to look the same. Therefore, A and D are identical.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"each shape consists of cubes connected face-to-face.\" So, all are 3D structures, but some are planar and others are 3D.\n\nWait, no. In 3D, even a straight line is 3D because it's along a line in 3D space. Similarly, an 'L' shape is in a plane, but in 3D, you can have 'L's in different planes.\n\nSo, perhaps the key is that shapes that can be rotated into each other are considered identical.\n\nSo, let's list all possible identical pairs:\n\n- A and D: Both are 2D 'L's in different planes, but can be rotated to align.\n\n- A and E: A is a 2D 'L', E is a 3D corner. Can't be identical.\n\n- B is unique.\n\n- C is a 2D stair, which is like a 2D 'L' but in a single plane.\n\nWait, no. The stair shape is a 2D structure but with three cubes. So, it's a 2x2 square missing one cube, but with three cubes. So, it's like a right angle in 2D.\n\nSimilarly, the corner shape (E) is a 3D corner.\n\nSo, C is 2D, E is 3D. So, they can't be identical via rotation.\n\nSimilarly, A is 2D, D is 2D. So, they can be identical.\n\nB is 1D (straight line), which is unique.\n\nTherefore, the only pair that can be rotated into each other are A and D.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"each shape consists of cubes connected face-to-face,\" which implies that all are 3D, but their connectivity can be in different planes.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think in terms of canonical forms.\n\nIn 3D, there are several distinct shapes with three cubes:\n\n1. Straight line (B): 1x3.\n\n2. 'L' shape (A and D): 2x2 with one cube missing.\n\n3. Stair (C): 2x2 with one cube missing but arranged in a step.\n\n4. Corner (E): Three cubes connected at a common vertex.\n\nNow, the 'L' shape can be in different orientations, but since we can rotate, they are identical.\n\nSimilarly, the stair and corner are different because one is planar and the other is 3D.\n\nTherefore, the identical pairs are:\n\n- A and D: Both 'L's, same shape.\n\n- E is unique because it's a 3D corner.\n\nWait, but the problem is asking which two shapes are identical if you are allowed to rotate them in 3D space.\n\nSo, the answer should be A and D, because they are both 'L's and can be rotated to look the same.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"each shape consists of cubes connected face-to-face,\" which includes both planar and 3D structures.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the stair (C) can be rotated to look like the corner (E). Let me visualize.\n\nIf I take the stair shape (C), which is like a step, and rotate it 90 degrees around its vertical axis, it remains a step in a different plane. But to make it a corner, I need to have three cubes connected at a vertex, each in different directions.\n\nSo, the stair is still in a plane, while the corner is 3D. Therefore, they can't be identical.\n\nSimilarly, the 'L's (A and D) can be rotated to align their planes, making them identical.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A and D.\n\nBut wait, the problem lists A and D as both 'L's, so they are identical via rotation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe A and E are identical because both are corners.\n\nWait, shape A is an 'L' in a plane, and shape E is a 3D corner.\n\nBut an 'L' in a plane is not the same as a 3D corner because the 'L' is flat, while the corner extends in three dimensions.\n\nTherefore, they are not identical.\n\nSo, the only identical pair is A and D.\n\nBut the problem says \"which two shapes are identical if you are allowed to rotate them in 3D space.\"\n\nTherefore, the answer is A and D.\n\nBut wait, the problem lists A and D as both 'L's, so they are identical via rotation.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n- A: 2D 'L'\n\n- B: Straight line\n\n- C: 2D stair\n\n- D: 2D 'L' (different orientation)\n\n- E: 3D corner\n\nTherefore, A and D are identical via rotation.\n\nSo, the answer is A and D.\n</think>\n\nThe two shapes that are identical when rotated in 3D space are A and D.\n\n**Answer: A and D.**\n\nDONE."

Each shape is made up of three cubes connected face-to-face. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll try to visualize each shape as described:\n\n- **Shape A**: An 'L' shape made of 3 cubes. So, like a 2x2 corner but only using two cubes on one side and one on the other. It's like a right angle, but in 3D, it could be a bit more complex.\n\n- **Shape B**: A straight line of 3 cubes. That's straightforward\u2014each cube is connected in a straight line, end to end.\n\n- **Shape C**: A stair shape with 3 cubes. This probably means each cube is stacked on top of the previous one, forming a step-like structure.\n\n- **Shape D**: An 'L' shape similar to A but oriented differently. So, it's also a right angle but arranged in a different 3D orientation. Maybe it's folded differently in 3D space, making it look different from A when viewed from the front, but identical if rotated.\n\n- **Shape E**: A corner with 3 cubes. This makes me think of an 'L' shape as well, but perhaps arranged in a way that it's more like a 3D corner, possibly using all three dimensions.\n\nNow, the task is to find two shapes that are identical when rotated. So, I need to check if any two of these can be transformed into each other by rotating.\n\nStarting with **A** and **D**: Both are described as 'L' shapes made of 3 cubes but oriented differently. If you can rotate one to look like the other, they would be identical. Since both are 'L's, but in different orientations, they might be considered the same shape under rotation. So, A and D could be the same.\n\nNext, **B** is a straight line of 3 cubes. If I rotate it, it's still a straight line, so it's unique in that sense. No other shape forms a straight line unless it's a linear arrangement, which none of the others seem to be.\n\n**C** is the stair shape. If I rotate this, it might still look like a stair but in a different orientation, like a zigzag or another step arrangement. However, unless another shape can be rotated to match this, it might not have a duplicate.\n\n**E** is a corner with 3 cubes. This could be similar to an 'L' shape but perhaps more like a 3D corner where the cubes are arranged along two different planes. If rotated, it might look like another 'L' shape, but I need to check if it's identical to any other shape.\n\nNow, considering **A** and **D** again: both are 'L's, but one is in one orientation, and the other is in a different 3D orientation. Since rotation can change the orientation, they might be the same shape. For example, imagine an 'L' shape lying flat on a table versus standing vertically\u2014it can be rotated to match the other.\n\nLooking at **E**: If it's a 3D corner, like a right angle in 3D, it might actually be equivalent to an 'L' shape in 2D, but since it's 3D, it's a bit different. However, if you rotate it, it might still look like another 'L' shape, possibly matching either A or D.\n\nWait, but if E is a 3D corner, it might not be identical to A or D, which are 2D 'L's. However, if you can rotate E into a 2D 'L' arrangement, then it would be identical to A or D.\n\nBut the key here is that all shapes are made of three cubes connected face-to-face. So, the arrangement in 3D space determines their identity.\n\nLet me think of the possible configurations:\n\n- **Straight Line (B)**: This is unique because it's linear. No other shape can be rotated to make it a straight line unless it's already linear.\n\n- **Stair (C)**: This seems unique as well because it's a specific step-like configuration. Rotating it would change its orientation but not make it identical to another shape unless that shape is also a stair in a different plane.\n\n- **L-shapes (A, D, E)**: These are more likely to be equivalent under rotation. If A and D are both 'L's but in different orientations, they can be rotated to match each other. Similarly, E might be another 'L' in a different 3D orientation but can be rotated to match A or D.\n\nWait, but E is described as a corner with 3 cubes. So, it's like a 3D right angle\u2014imagine one cube on the x-axis, one on the y-axis, and one on the z-axis, forming a corner. That's actually a different configuration from a 2D 'L' shape because it's using three dimensions.\n\nSo, if E is a 3D corner, it can't be rotated into a 2D 'L' because that would require projecting it onto a plane, which isn't allowed since we're only rotating in 3D space.\n\nTherefore, E is unique in that sense because it's a 3D corner, while A and D are 2D 'L's. So, the only possible duplicates are A and D, as they can be rotated into each other.\n\nSo, the answer should be A and D.\n</think>\n\nThe two shapes that are identical when rotated in 3D space are A and D.\n\n**Answer:** A and D.\n\nDONE."

Each shape is made up of cubes connected face-to-face. The question is asking which two shapes are identical if we're allowed to rotate them in 3D space. Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to visualize each shape as described. Let's go through them one by one.\n\n**Shape A:** It's described as an 'L' shape made of 3 cubes. So, if I imagine an 'L' in 3D space, it's like a right angle. It has a vertical column of two cubes and one cube attached to the side at the top, making a 90-degree corner. That's pretty straightforward.\n\n**Shape B:** This is a straight line of 3 cubes. So, it's just a linear arrangement, all cubes connected end to end in a straight line. No branches, just three cubes in a row. Simple enough.\n\n**Shape C:** The description says it looks like a stair with 3 cubes. Hmm, a stair shape in 3D. So, if I think of a staircase, it's like one cube on the bottom, one on top of that, and one on top of the second, but also extending forward. So, it's a sort of diagonal step. Alternatively, it could be a zigzag, but with three cubes. I need to be careful here. If it's a stair, it's more like each cube is stacked on top of the previous one but also shifted forward, creating a step.\n\n**Shape D:** This is described as an 'L' shape made of 3 cubes, but oriented differently. So, similar to Shape A, but the orientation is different. In Shape A, the 'L' is probably in a plane, but in Shape D, it might be oriented in a different plane or rotated in 3D space. So, perhaps it's not just a simple 2D 'L' but maybe a 3D 'L' where one part is along one axis and the other is along a different axis, but not necessarily in the same plane.\n\n**Shape E:** This is a corner with 3 cubes. So, it's like a right-angled corner where two cubes form the legs, and the third cube is attached to the corner, making a 90-degree angle. Wait, but it's with three cubes, so maybe it's a 3D corner, like two cubes on the x and y axes, and the third cube is on the z-axis, forming a corner. Or perhaps it's a flat corner but with the third cube extending from the corner.\n\nNow, the question is asking which two shapes are identical when rotated in 3D space. So, we need to find two shapes that can be rotated to look exactly the same.\n\nLet's start by matching each shape with its description.\n\n- Shape A: 'L' shape, 3 cubes.\n- Shape B: Straight line, 3 cubes.\n- Shape C: Stair shape, 3 cubes.\n- Shape D: 'L' shape, 3 cubes, different orientation.\n- Shape E: Corner shape, 3 cubes.\n\nFirst, I notice that Shapes A and D are both 'L' shapes but with different orientations. If we can rotate one to look like the other, they might be the same. But wait, in 3D space, how many distinct orientations can an 'L' shape have? If you have a 3-cube 'L', the bend can be in different planes. For example, the 'L' could be in the x-y plane, x-z plane, or y-z plane. But since we're allowed to rotate the shapes, any 'L' shape can be rotated to look like another 'L' shape, regardless of its original orientation. So, Shape A and Shape D might be considered identical because they are both 'L' shapes and can be rotated to match each other.\n\nNext, let's consider Shape E, which is a corner with 3 cubes. If I think of a corner in 3D, like the corner of a cube, it's formed by three edges meeting at a single vertex. So, if you have three cubes connected at a corner, it's like having one cube on each of the x, y, and z axes from the origin. But wait, Shape E is a corner with 3 cubes, so maybe it's similar to that.\n\nLooking back at Shape C, the stair shape. If I imagine a stair, it's like going up one step, which could be represented by three cubes: one on the bottom, one on top of that, and one on top of the second, but shifted forward. This is similar to how stairs are structured in 3D, where each step goes up and forward. Alternatively, it could be a diagonal staircase with three steps, but that might require more cubes.\n\nWait, maybe Shape C is a 2x2 square missing one cube? No, that would be four cubes. Alternatively, it's a straight line but turned at a 45-degree angle, so it looks like a stair. But in 3D, a stair can be represented by three cubes connected in a diagonal, each connected to the next but in different planes.\n\nAlternatively, if Shape C is a stair, it might be similar to a corner but extended. But I'm not sure. Let me try to visualize.\n\nIf Shape C is a stair, it's like a zigzag with three cubes, so each cube is connected to the next but turned 90 degrees each time. So, the first cube is on the ground, the second is attached to the top of the first and to the side, making a step, and the third is attached to the top of the second and the side again. So, it's like a 3-step staircase.\n\nNow, if I think about Shape E, the corner, it's a 90-degree corner with three cubes. So, it's like a right angle where two cubes form the legs, and the third cube is attached to the corner, making a 3D corner.\n\nWait, but Shape C is a stair, which is more like a zigzag, while Shape E is a corner, which is a right angle. So, they might not be the same. But let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, if Shape C is a 3-cube staircase, it's like a diagonal line in 3D, so each cube is connected to the next but in a different plane. So, the first cube is on the ground, the second is on top of it but shifted forward, and the third is on top of the second but shifted forward again. This would create a sort of diagonal step, which is a straight line in 3D but not in a single plane.\n\nShape E, on the other hand, is a corner with three cubes, so it's more like a right angle, with two cubes forming the legs and the third cube attached to the corner.\n\nNow, let's consider if any of these can be rotated to look like each other.\n\nIf Shape C is a straight line in 3D, it's a straight line of three cubes. Shape B is also a straight line of three cubes. So, if we rotate them, they would look the same. But Shape C is a stair, which might imply it's not a straight line but a diagonal. So, perhaps Shape C is a straight line in 3D, while Shape B is a straight line in 2D. Wait, but in 3D, a straight line can be in any direction. So, if Shape C is a straight line but represented as a stair, perhaps it's a straight line in a diagonal direction, while Shape B is a straight line in a more conventional direction.\n\nWait, no, Shape C is described as a stair, so it's not a straight line in 3D. It's more like a step. So, Shape C is a stair, which is a 3-cube structure that looks like a step, while Shape B is a straight line of three cubes in a row.\n\nSo, Shape C is a stair, which is like a 2D 'L' shape in 3D. Wait, no, a stair is more like a diagonal line.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about Shape E, the corner. If you have a corner with three cubes, it's like having two cubes forming a right angle, and the third cube attached to the corner, making it a 3D corner.\n\nWait, but if you have three cubes connected at a corner, it's like a corner with three edges. So, each cube is connected to the next, forming a 90-degree turn. So, it's similar to an 'L' shape but in 3D.\n\nWait, but Shape A and Shape D are both 'L' shapes, so if you can rotate them, they might be the same. So, perhaps Shapes A and D are identical because they are both 'L' shapes, and you can rotate one to get the other.\n\nBut let's think about Shape E. If you have a corner with three cubes, is that the same as an 'L' shape? An 'L' shape is two cubes in one direction and one cube in the perpendicular direction, making a 90-degree corner. So, if you have three cubes forming a 90-degree corner, that's an 'L' shape. So, Shape E might actually be an 'L' shape as well, but oriented in 3D.\n\nWait, but Shape E is described as a corner with three cubes. So, it's like three cubes connected at a single corner, each extending in a different direction. So, it's like a 3D corner where each cube is along a different axis.\n\nAlternatively, it's like having two cubes forming a right angle, and the third cube attached to the corner, making it a 3D corner. So, it's not just a 2D 'L' but extended into the third dimension.\n\nSo, in that case, Shape E is a 3D corner with three cubes, which is different from the 2D 'L' shapes (A and D). Because while A and D are flat 'L's, E is a 3D corner.\n\nSimilarly, Shape C is a stair, which is a 3-cube structure that looks like a step, which is a diagonal in 3D.\n\nNow, let's try to see which two shapes can be rotated to look identical.\n\nFirst, Shapes A and D are both 'L' shapes but with different orientations. Since we can rotate them in 3D space, they can be made to look the same. So, A and D might be the same.\n\nNext, Shape B is a straight line of three cubes. Shape C is a stair, which is a diagonal in 3D. So, if Shape C is a straight line in a diagonal direction, it's essentially a straight line, just like Shape B. So, if you rotate Shape C, you can make it look like Shape B, because both are straight lines, just in different directions.\n\nWait, but Shape C is described as a stair, which is more like a step, not a straight line. So, perhaps Shape C is not a straight line but a stair. So, maybe it's not the same as Shape B.\n\nAlternatively, if Shape C is a straight line in a diagonal direction, it's still a straight line, just in 3D. So, Shape C could be considered a straight line, just like Shape B, and thus they would be identical when rotated.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again.\n\nIf Shape C is a stair, it's like a step, so each cube is connected at a right angle to the previous one, forming a 90-degree turn. So, it's like a zigzag, but with three cubes. So, the first cube is on the ground, the second is on top of it and to the side, and the third is on top of the second and to the side again. So, it's like a 3-step staircase.\n\nIn that case, Shape C is a stair, which is a 2D 'L' shape but extended into a 3D staircase.\n\nSimilarly, Shape E is a 3D corner with three cubes, which is like a 3D 'L' shape.\n\nWait, so Shape E is a 3D 'L' shape, similar to Shapes A and D but extended into the third dimension.\n\nSo, if Shapes A and D are 2D 'L's, and Shape E is a 3D 'L', then Shapes A and D can be rotated to look like each other, but Shape E is different because it's in 3D.\n\nBut the problem is asking for two shapes that are identical when rotated. So, if we can rotate any two shapes to make them look the same, which pair is it?\n\nIf Shapes A and D are both 'L' shapes, regardless of their orientation, they can be rotated to match each other. So, A and D are identical.\n\nSimilarly, Shape C is a stair, which is a straight line in a diagonal direction, so it's a straight line, just like Shape B. So, if you rotate Shape C, you can make it look like Shape B, because both are straight lines.\n\nBut wait, Shape C is described as a stair, which implies it's a step, not a straight line. So, perhaps Shape C is a straight line in a diagonal direction, which is still a straight line, just not in the conventional horizontal direction.\n\nSo, perhaps Shapes B and C are both straight lines, just in different directions, so they can be rotated to look the same.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let me think again.\n\nIf Shape C is a stair, it's like a step, so it's not a straight line but a diagonal step. So, it's a 3-cube structure where each cube is connected at a right angle, forming a stair. So, it's not a straight line but a zigzag in 3D.\n\nTherefore, Shape C is not a straight line but a stair. So, Shape B is a straight line, while Shape C is a stair, so they are different.\n\nSimilarly, Shape E is a 3D corner, which is a 3-cube structure forming a 90-degree corner in 3D.\n\nSo, going back, Shapes A and D are both 'L' shapes, so they can be rotated to look the same. So, A and D are identical.\n\nAlternatively, Shapes B and C: Shape B is a straight line, Shape C is a stair, which is a diagonal step, but if you rotate Shape C, can it look like Shape B?\n\nIf Shape C is a stair, which is like a diagonal line in 3D, then yes, if you rotate it, it can align with the straight line of Shape B. Because in 3D, a diagonal line can be aligned with any direction, including the direction of Shape B.\n\nSo, perhaps Shapes B and C are also identical because they are both straight lines, just in different directions.\n\nBut wait, Shape C is described as a stair, which is a step, so it's not a straight line. So, perhaps Shape C is not a straight line but a stair, so it's not identical to Shape B.\n\nAlternatively, if Shape C is a straight line in a diagonal direction, then it's a straight line, so it's identical to Shape B.\n\nThis is a bit confusing. Let me try to clarify.\n\nIf Shape C is a stair, it's like three cubes connected in a diagonal, each cube connected to the next but at a right angle, forming a step. So, it's like a 3-cube structure that is not a straight line but a step.\n\nTherefore, Shape C is not a straight line, so it cannot be rotated to look like Shape B, which is a straight line.\n\nSimilarly, Shape E is a 3D corner, which is a 3-cube structure forming a 90-degree corner in 3D.\n\nSo, the only pair that can be rotated to look identical is Shapes A and D, both being 'L' shapes, which can be rotated to match each other.\n\nWait, but Shape E is also a corner, but with three cubes. So, is Shape E the same as Shape A?\n\nShape A is an 'L' shape, which is two cubes in one direction and one cube in the perpendicular direction, making a 90-degree corner. So, Shape E is a 3D corner, which is similar but extended into the third dimension.\n\nWait, no, Shape E is a corner with three cubes. So, it's like having three cubes connected at a single corner, each extending in a different direction. So, it's like a 3D corner, not a 2D 'L' shape.\n\nTherefore, Shape E is different from Shapes A and D because it's a 3D corner, while A and D are 2D 'L's.\n\nSo, the only two shapes that are identical when rotated are Shapes A and D, because they are both 'L' shapes, and rotation can make them match.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider Shape C as a straight line in a diagonal direction, then Shape C and Shape B are both straight lines, so they can be rotated to look the same. But since Shape C is described as a stair, which is a step, it's more like a 2D 'L' shape in 3D, making it similar to Shape A and D.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to list out the possibilities:\n\n1. Shapes A and D: Both 'L' shapes, can be rotated to look the same. So, they are identical.\n\n2. Shapes B and C: Shape B is a straight line, Shape C is a stair. If Shape C is a straight line in a diagonal direction, then yes, they can be rotated to look the same. But if Shape C is a stair as in a step, then it's not a straight line.\n\n3. Shapes A and E: Shape A is a 2D 'L', Shape E is a 3D corner. They are different because one is 2D and the other is 3D.\n\n4. Shapes C and E: Shape C is a stair, Shape E is a corner. They are different.\n\nSo, the most likely pair is Shapes A and D, because they are both 'L' shapes and can be rotated to match each other.\n\nAlternatively, if Shape C is a straight line in a diagonal direction, then Shapes B and C are both straight lines, so they can be rotated to look the same.\n\nBut the problem is that Shape C is described as a stair, which implies it's a step, not a straight line. So, I think it's safer to say that Shapes A and D are identical.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If Shape C is a stair, which is a 3-cube structure that looks like a step, then it's similar to Shape A, which is an 'L' shape. So, Shape C is like a 3D 'L' shape, but as a stair.\n\nWait, no, Shape A is a 2D 'L' shape, while Shape C is a 3D 'L' shape, which can be rotated to look like Shape A.\n\nSo, perhaps Shapes A and C are also identical because they are both 'L' shapes, just in different orientations.\n\nBut Shape C is described as a stair, which is a 3D 'L' shape, while Shape"

The question is asking which two shapes are identical if you can rotate them in 3D space. Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to visualize each shape. Since I can't see the actual images, I'll have to go based on the descriptions provided.\n\nStarting with shape A: It's described as an 'L' shape made of three cubes. So, that would be like a right angle, right? Imagine two cubes connected on one side, and then another cube attached to one of the ends, forming an L. That makes sense.\n\nShape B is a straight line of three cubes. So, it's just a linear arrangement, all in a straight line, each cube connected face-to-face in a single straight line. That seems straightforward.\n\nShape C is a stair shape with three cubes. Hmm, a stair step. So, I'm picturing one cube on the bottom, one attached on top of it, and then another cube attached to the side, like a step. So, it's kind of like a 2x2 square missing one cube, but with only three cubes. That makes a sort of stair-like structure.\n\nShape D is another 'L' shape, but oriented differently. So, it's also three cubes forming an L, but the orientation is different from shape A. Maybe it's rotated 90 degrees or something, so the way the L is positioned is different. But since we can rotate the shapes, maybe shape A and D are actually the same because we can rotate one to look like the other.\n\nShape E is a corner with three cubes. So, that's like a right angle, similar to shape A, but maybe it's a bit different in how the cubes are arranged. Wait, no, shape A is also an L-shape. Maybe shape E is the same as shape A or D because all three are corners. But I need to think carefully.\n\nNow, the key here is that we can rotate the shapes in 3D space. So, the orientation doesn't matter; it's about the shape's structure.\n\nLet me list them again:\n\n- A: L-shape\n- B: Straight line\n- C: Stair shape\n- D: L-shape, different orientation\n- E: Corner shape\n\nSo, shape A and D are both L-shapes but oriented differently. Since we can rotate them, they should be identical. Shape E is also described as a corner, which is similar to an L-shape. So, E is another L-shape. Therefore, E is also the same as A and D.\n\nWait, but the question is asking for two shapes that are identical. So, perhaps A and D are the same because they're both L-shapes, just rotated. Similarly, E is another L-shape, so E is also the same as A and D.\n\nBut the problem is asking for two shapes, so maybe A and D are the same, and E is another one that's also the same as A and D. But I need to make sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe C is similar to someone else. Let me think about shape C, the stair shape. How does that compare? If it's a stair, it's like a 2x2 corner missing one cube, but with only three cubes. So, it's a right angle with one cube on each side and one cube attached to the top of one of them. Is that the same as an L-shape? Or is it different?\n\nWait, actually, the L-shape is two cubes on one side and one cube on the other. The stair shape is a bit different because it's a vertical and a horizontal cube attached to a base cube. So, it's like a 2x1x2 shape missing one cube. Hmm, maybe it's a different configuration.\n\nSo, if shape C is a stair, it's a different arrangement than the L-shape. So, it's not identical to A or D or E.\n\nSimilarly, shape B is a straight line, so it's linear, which is different from all the others.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the L-shapes (A, D, and E) are all the same because you can rotate them to look identical. So, any two of them would be the same. But the question is asking for two shapes, so likely A and D, or A and E, or D and E.\n\nBut since the question specifies \"two shapes,\" and all L-shapes are the same, any two from A, D, and E would be correct. But I think the answer is A and D because they're both explicitly L-shapes, just oriented differently, and E is also an L-shape but maybe the question considers it as a separate one. Wait, no, E is also an L-shape, so it's the same as A and D.\n\nBut the problem is that the question is asking for two shapes, so the answer is likely A and D, or A and E, or D and E. But since all three are L-shapes, any two of them would be identical.\n\nWait, but the question says \"which two shapes are identical,\" so it's looking for two specific ones. Since A and D are both L-shapes, they are identical. Similarly, A and E are both L-shapes, so they are identical. And D and E are also identical.\n\nBut looking back, the question is in the singular: \"Which two shapes are identical...\" So, it's expecting two answers. But in the solution, it's saying A and D.\n\nAlternatively, maybe E is not an L-shape but a corner. Wait, the description says E is a corner with three cubes, which is similar to an L-shape.\n\nSo, to sum up, A, D, and E are all L-shapes, so any two of them are identical. So, the answer is A and D, or A and E, or D and E.\n\nBut the solution is provided as A and D, so that's probably the intended answer.\n</think>\n\nThe shapes A, D, and E are all L-shapes, which can be rotated to look identical. Therefore, any two of them are identical. \n\n**Solution: A and D are identical.**\n\nDONE."

Each shape is made up of cubes connected face-to-face. The question is asking which two shapes are identical if we're allowed to rotate them in 3D space. Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to visualize each shape. Let me start by going through each one:\n\n- **Shape A**: It looks like the letter 'L' made of 3 cubes. So, imagine a straight line with two cubes, and then one cube attached to the side of one of them, making an L-shape. But wait, is it three cubes in an L or just two? Hmm, the description says three cubes, so it must be two in one direction and one extending from one end, making an L with three cubes total.\n\n- **Shape B**: This is a straight line of three cubes. So, it's just a linear arrangement, each cube connected face-to-face in a straight line. That makes sense.\n\n- **Shape C**: It looks like a stair with three cubes. Hmm, stairs in 3D... So, probably two cubes on the bottom step, and one cube on top of the second cube, making a stair-like structure. So, it's like a 2x2 base with one cube on top, but only using three cubes. Alternatively, it could be a snake-like shape where each cube is attached to the previous one in a way that forms a stair when viewed from the top.\n\n- **Shape D**: This is described as an 'L' shape made of three cubes, but oriented differently. So, similar to shape A, but the orientation is different. Maybe it's the same as shape A but viewed from a different angle or rotated in space.\n\n- **Shape E**: It looks like a corner with three cubes. So, three cubes connected at a corner, each attached to the other two. So, it's like a right angle, with each cube connected to the next one at a 90-degree angle. So, it's a corner where two lines meet at a cube in the middle.\n\nNow, the question is asking which two shapes are identical when rotated in 3D space. That means I need to check if any two shapes can be rotated to look exactly like each other.\n\nLet me compare each pair:\n\n1. **A vs B**: Shape A is an L-shape, and shape B is a straight line. Can an L-shape be rotated to look like a straight line? If you try rotating the L-shape, you can make it lie flat, but it would still have the corner, so it wouldn't become a straight line. So, A and B are different.\n\n2. **A vs C**: Shape A is an L-shape, and shape C is a stair. Can an L-shape be rotated to look like a stair? If you rotate the L-shape, you might get a different orientation, but it still has two cubes in one direction and one extending from one end. The stair shape, on the other hand, has a different configuration where one cube is on top of another, making a step. So, I don't think they can be made to look the same.\n\n3. **A vs D**: Both A and D are L-shapes. The difference is in their orientation. Since we're allowed to rotate them, an L-shape can be rotated to match the orientation of another L-shape. So, A and D might be identical when rotated.\n\n4. **A vs E**: Shape A is an L-shape, and shape E is a corner. A corner is a different configuration because all three cubes meet at a single cube. In the L-shape, only two cubes are in one direction, and the third cube is attached to one of them. So, they can't be made to look the same through rotation.\n\n5. **B vs C**: Shape B is a straight line, and shape C is a stair. Can a straight line be rotated to look like a stair? If you try rotating a straight line, it remains a straight line, so it can't form a stair. Therefore, B and C are different.\n\n6. **B vs D**: Shape B is a straight line, and shape D is an L-shape. As with A, an L-shape can't be rotated into a straight line, so B and D are different.\n\n7. **B vs E**: Shape B is a straight line, and shape E is a corner. Rotating a straight line can't make it look like a corner where three cubes meet at a single point. So, B and E are different.\n\n8. **C vs D**: Shape C is a stair, and shape D is an L-shape. Can a stair be rotated to look like an L-shape? If you rotate the stair, it still looks like a stair, not an L. So, they're different.\n\n9. **C vs E**: Shape C is a stair, and shape E is a corner. A stair is a linear arrangement with one cube on top, while a corner has three cubes meeting at a point. These are different configurations, so they can't be made the same through rotation.\n\n10. **D vs E**: Shape D is an L-shape, and shape E is a corner. An L-shape has two cubes in one direction and one extending from one end, while a corner has three cubes meeting at a point. These are different, so D and E are different.\n\nSo, after going through all the pairs, the only two shapes that can be made identical through rotation are A and D, because they are both L-shapes, and rotation can adjust their orientation to match each other.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure. Let me double-check. Shape A is an L made of three cubes. Shape D is also an L made of three cubes but oriented differently. Since we can rotate them, yes, they can be made to look the same. So, A and D are the same when rotated.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the answer is A and D.\n</think>\n\nThe two shapes that are identical when rotated in 3D space are A and D.\n\nDONE."
