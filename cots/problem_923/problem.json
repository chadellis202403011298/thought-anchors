  "question": "Five 3D shapes are shown below, labeled A through E. Each shape consists of cubes connected face-to-face.\n\nA: A shape that looks like the letter 'L' made of 3 cubes\nB: A straight line of 3 cubes\nC: A shape that looks like a stair with 3 cubes\nD: A shape that looks like the letter 'L' made of 3 cubes, but oriented differently\nE: A shape that looks like a corner with 3 cubes\n\nWhich two shapes are identical if you are allowed to rotate them in 3D space?",
  "answer": "The shapes A and D are identical when rotated appropriately in 3D space.\n\nLet's analyze each shape:\n- Shape A is an 'L' shape made of 3 cubes arranged in a specific orientation\n- Shape B is a straight line of 3 cubes (all cubes in one dimension)\n- Shape C is a stair-like shape with 3 cubes (each cube offset in two dimensions)\n- Shape D is also an 'L' shape made of 3 cubes, but in a different orientation than A\n- Shape E is a corner shape with 3 cubes (cubes extending in three dimensions)\n\nTo determine which shapes are identical when rotated, I need to consider their fundamental structure regardless of orientation:\n- The 'L' shape (shapes A and D) consists of two cubes in a straight line, with the third cube attached at a right angle to one end.\n- The straight line (shape B) has all three cubes in a row.\n- The stair shape (shape C) has each cube offset diagonally.\n- The corner shape (shape E) has cubes extending in three different dimensions.\n\nSince shapes A and D are both 'L' shapes consisting of the same arrangement of cubes but in different orientations, they are identical when one is rotated to match the other's orientation."
