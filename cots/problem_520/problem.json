  "question": "Consider the following sequence: 3, 6, 11, 18, 27, ...\nWhat is the next number in this sequence?",
  "answer": "The next number in the sequence is 38.\n\nTo solve this problem, I'll examine the differences between consecutive terms to identify the pattern:\n\nTerm 1: 3\nTerm 2: 6 (difference of 3 from previous term)\nTerm 3: 11 (difference of 5 from previous term)\nTerm 4: 18 (difference of 7 from previous term)\nTerm 5: 27 (difference of 9 from previous term)\n\nLooking at these differences: 3, 5, 7, 9\nI notice these differences themselves form a pattern - they increase by 2 each time.\n\nSo the next difference will be 9 + 2 = 11.\nTherefore, the next term in the original sequence will be 27 + 11 = 38.\n\nThis sequence follows the pattern where the nth term equals the (n-1)th term plus (2n-1). This is sometimes referred to as a second-order linear sequence, where the differences between consecutive terms form an arithmetic sequence."
