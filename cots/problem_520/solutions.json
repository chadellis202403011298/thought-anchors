Hmm, let me start by looking at the differences between the numbers to see if I can spot a pattern.\n\nFirst, I'll list the numbers and their differences:\n\n- 6 - 3 = 3\n- 11 - 6 = 5\n- 18 - 11 = 7\n- 27 - 18 = 9\n\nOkay, so the differences are 3, 5, 7, 9. It looks like these differences are increasing by 2 each time. That makes me think this might be a quadratic sequence because the second difference is constant. \n\nLet me recall that in a quadratic sequence, the nth term can be expressed as an\u00b2 + bn + c. To find the coefficients a, b, and c, I can set up equations using the known terms.\n\nLet's denote the nth term as T(n). So:\n\n- For n = 1: T(1) = 3\n- For n = 2: T(2) = 6\n- For n = 3: T(3) = 11\n- For n = 4: T(4) = 18\n- For n = 5: T(5) = 27\n\nUsing the quadratic formula, T(n) = an\u00b2 + bn + c.\n\nPlugging in the first term:\na(1)\u00b2 + b(1) + c = 3 \u21d2 a + b + c = 3 ... (1)\n\nSecond term:\na(2)\u00b2 + b(2) + c = 6 \u21d2 4a + 2b + c = 6 ... (2)\n\nThird term:\na(3)\u00b2 + b(3) + c = 11 \u21d2 9a + 3b + c = 11 ... (3)\n\nNow, I can subtract equation (1) from equation (2) to eliminate c:\n\n(4a + 2b + c) - (a + b + c) = 6 - 3\n3a + b = 3 ... (4)\n\nSimilarly, subtract equation (2) from equation (3):\n\n(9a + 3b + c) - (4a + 2b + c) = 11 - 6\n5a + b = 5 ... (5)\n\nNow, subtract equation (4) from equation (5):\n\n(5a + b) - (3a + b) = 5 - 3\n2a = 2 \u21d2 a = 1\n\nSubstituting a = 1 into equation (4):\n\n3(1) + b = 3 \u21d2 3 + b = 3 \u21d2 b = 0\n\nNow, substitute a = 1 and b = 0 into equation (1):\n\n1 + 0 + c = 3 \u21d2 c = 2\n\nSo, the quadratic formula gives us T(n) = n\u00b2 + 0n + 2 \u21d2 T(n) = n\u00b2 + 2.\n\nLet me verify this with the given terms:\n\n- T(1) = 1 + 2 = 3 \u2714\ufe0f\n- T(2) = 4 + 2 = 6 \u2714\ufe0f\n- T(3) = 9 + 2 = 11 \u2714\ufe0f\n- T(4) = 16 + 2 = 18 \u2714\ufe0f\n- T(5) = 25 + 2 = 27 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect! It fits all the given numbers. So, the next term, which would be T(6), is:\n\nT(6) = 6\u00b2 + 2 = 36 + 2 = 38.\n\nTherefore, the next number in the sequence is 38.\n</think>\n\nThe sequence is quadratic, with the nth term given by T(n) = n\u00b2 + 2. The next term, T(6), is 38.\n\n**Answer:** 38  \nDONE."

Let me start by looking at the differences between the numbers to see if I can spot a pattern.\n\nStarting from the first number, 3, the next number is 6. So, the difference there is 6 minus 3, which is 3. Then, from 6 to 11, the difference is 11 minus 6, which is 5. Okay, so far, the differences are 3 and 5. Let me keep going. From 11 to 18, the difference is 18 minus 11, which is 7. Then, from 18 to 27, the difference is 27 minus 18, which is 9. So, the differences I have are 3, 5, 7, and 9.\n\nHmm, those differences seem to be increasing by 2 each time. Let me write that down: 3, 5, 7, 9, and so on. That looks like an arithmetic sequence where each term increases by 2. So, if this pattern continues, the next difference should be 11, right? Because 9 plus 2 is 11.\n\nIf I add that to the last number, which is 27, 27 plus 11 equals 38. So, the next number in the sequence should be 38. Let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting from 3, adding 3 gives 6. Then, adding 5 gives 11. Adding 7 gives 18. Adding 9 gives 27. Then, adding 11 should give 38. Yep, that seems consistent. So, I think 38 is the right answer.\n</think>\n\nThe sequence increases by differences that form an arithmetic progression starting at 3 with a common difference of 2. The differences are 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, etc. Adding the next difference (11) to 27 gives 38.\n\nDONE."

Hmm, let's see. I'm not entirely sure what type of sequence this is, so I'll start by looking at the differences between the numbers to see if there's a pattern.\n\nFirst, I'll list out the differences between consecutive terms:\n\n6 - 3 = 3\n\n11 - 6 = 5\n\n18 - 11 = 7\n\n27 - 18 = 9\n\nSo the differences are 3, 5, 7, 9.

So that confirms it's a quadratic sequence.\n\nNow, for a quadratic sequence, the nth term can be expressed as:\n\nan\u00b2 + bn + c\n\nWhere a, b, c are constants to be determined.\n\nWe can find these constants using the known terms.\n\nLet's denote the terms as:\n\nTerm 1: n=1, a(1)\u00b2 + b(1) + c = a + b + c = 3\n\nTerm 2: n=2, a(2)\u00b2 + b(2) + c = 4a + 2b + c = 6\n\nTerm 3: n=3, a(3)\u00b2 + b(3) + c = 9a + 3b + c = 11\n\nSo we have a system of equations:\n\n1) a + b + c = 3\n\n2) 4a + 2b + c = 6\n\n3) 9a + 3b + c = 11\n\nLet me solve this step by step.\n\nFirst, subtract equation 1 from equation 2:\n\n(4a + 2b + c) - (a + b + c) = 6 - 3\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n3a + b = 3  --> equation 4\n\nSimilarly, subtract equation 2 from equation 3:\n\n(9a + 3b + c) - (4a + 2b + c) = 11 - 6\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n5a + b = 5  --> equation 5\n\nNow, subtract equation 4 from equation 5:\n\n(5a + b) - (3a + b) = 5 - 3\n\nWhich gives:\n\n2a = 2\n\nSo, a = 1\n\nNow plug a = 1 into equation 4:\n\n3(1) + b = 3\n\n3 + b = 3\n\nSo, b = 0\n\nNow, plug a = 1 and b = 0 into equation 1:\n\n1 + 0 + c = 3\n\nSo, c = 2\n\nTherefore, the nth term is:\n\nn\u00b2 + 0n + 2 = n\u00b2 + 2\n\nLet me verify this with the given terms.\n\nn=1: 1 + 2 = 3 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: 4 + 2 = 6 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: 9 + 2 = 11 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: 16 + 2 = 18 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: 25 + 2 = 27 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, it fits all the given terms.

Hmm, okay, let's start by looking at the differences between the numbers to see if there's a pattern.\n\nFirst, I'll list out the numbers and compute the differences between consecutive terms. \n\n- 6 - 3 = 3\n- 11 - 6 = 5\n- 18 - 11 = 7\n- 27 - 18 = 9\n\nSo the differences are 3, 5, 7, 9.

Because 9 + 2 = 11.\n\nSo, if I add that next difference to 27, what do I get? Let me calculate that: 27 + 11 = 38. So, the next number should be 38.\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. The differences are 3, 5, 7, 9, so the next one is indeed 11. Adding that to the last term, 27 + 11 equals 38. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nAnother way to look at it is to see if the sequence is quadratic or something else. Let me check the second differences. \n\nFirst differences: 3, 5, 7, 9\nSecond differences: 2 (5-3), 2 (7-5), 2 (9-7)\n\nOkay, so the second differences are constant at 2. That means the sequence is quadratic. The general formula for such a sequence is an\u00b2 + bn + c. Let me try to find coefficients a, b, and c.\n\nLet's set up equations using the first few terms:\n\nFor n=1: a(1)\u00b2 + b(1) + c = 3 \u2192 a + b + c = 3\nFor n=2: a(2)\u00b2 + b(2) + c = 6 \u2192 4a + 2b + c = 6\nFor n=3: a(3)\u00b2 + b(3) + c = 11 \u2192 9a + 3b + c = 11\n\nNow, I'll solve these equations step by step.\n\nFirst, subtract the first equation from the second:\n(4a + 2b + c) - (a + b + c) = 6 - 3\n3a + b = 3 \u2192 Equation (A)\n\nNext, subtract the second equation from the third:\n(9a + 3b + c) - (4a + 2b + c) = 11 - 6\n5a + b = 5 \u2192 Equation (B)\n\nNow, subtract Equation (A) from Equation (B):\n(5a + b) - (3a + b) = 5 - 3\n2a = 2 \u2192 a = 1\n\nPlugging a = 1 into Equation (A):\n3(1) + b = 3 \u2192 3 + b = 3 \u2192 b = 0\n\nNow, plug a = 1 and b = 0 into the first equation:\n1 + 0 + c = 3 \u2192 c = 2\n\nSo the quadratic formula is n\u00b2 + 0n + 2, which simplifies to n\u00b2 + 2.\n\nLet me test this with the given numbers:\n\n- For n=1: 1 + 2 = 3 \u2714\ufe0f\n- For n=2: 4 + 2 = 6 \u2714\ufe0f\n- For n=3: 9 + 2 = 11 \u2714\ufe0f\n- For n=4: 16 + 2 = 18 \u2714\ufe0f\n- For n=5: 25 + 2 = 27 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, it fits all the given terms. So the next term when n=6 would be 6\u00b2 + 2 = 36 + 2 = 38.\n\nAlternatively, since the differences are increasing by 2 each time, the sequence is quadratic, and we've confirmed that the formula is n\u00b2 + 2. So, the next term is definitely 38.\n\nI think that's solid. No mistakes in the calculations, and it fits all the terms given. So, the next number in the sequence is 38.\n</think>\n\nThe next number in the sequence is determined by recognizing that the differences between consecutive terms form an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 2. The second differences are constant, indicating a quadratic sequence. The quadratic formula derived is n\u00b2 + 2. For n=6, the next term is 6\u00b2 + 2 = 38.\n\n**Answer:** 38\n\nDONE."

    "solution": "Solve this problem step by step. End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: Consider the following sequence: 3, 6, 11, 18, 27, ...\nWhat is the next number in this sequence? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this sequence here: 3, 6, 11, 18, 27, and I need to figure out what the next number is. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I'll write down the numbers to see if I can spot a pattern. The sequence is 3, 6, 11, 18, 27. Hmm, let's look at the differences between consecutive numbers to see if that helps.\n\nSo, starting with 3 to 6, the difference is 3. Then, 6 to 11 is 5. Next, 11 to 18 is 7. After that, 18 to 27 is 9. Okay, so the differences are 3, 5, 7, 9. That looks like an arithmetic sequence where each difference increases by 2. So, the differences themselves are increasing by 2 each time.\n\nIf that's the case, then the next difference should be 11 (since 9 + 2 = 11). So, adding 11 to the last number, which is 27, would give me 27 + 11 = 38. So, the next number should be 38.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. The differences are 3, 5, 7, 9, so the next difference is 11. Adding that to 27 does give 38. That seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about the sequence in terms of some formula. Let me see if I can model this with a quadratic or something.\n\nLooking at the positions and the numbers:\n\nPosition 1: 3\n\nPosition 2: 6\n\nPosition 3: 11\n\nPosition 4: 18\n\nPosition 5: 27\n\nLet me see if I can find a formula for the nth term. Let's denote the nth term as a(n). \n\nIf I suppose that a(n) is a quadratic function, it might look like a(n) = an\u00b2 + bn + c.\n\nLet me plug in the values to create equations.\n\nFor n=1: a(1) = a + b + c = 3\n\nFor n=2: a(2) = 4a + 2b + c = 6\n\nFor n=3: a(3) = 9a + 3b + c = 11\n\nNow, I can set up these equations:\n\n1) a + b + c = 3\n\n2) 4a + 2b + c = 6\n\n3) 9a + 3b + c = 11\n\nSubtract equation 1 from equation 2:\n\n(4a + 2b + c) - (a + b + c) = 6 - 3\n\n3a + b = 3 --> Equation 4\n\nSubtract equation 2 from equation 3:\n\n(9a + 3b + c) - (4a + 2b + c) = 11 - 6\n\n5a + b = 5 --> Equation 5\n\nNow, subtract equation 4 from equation 5:\n\n(5a + b) - (3a + b) = 5 - 3\n\n2a = 2 --> a = 1\n\nNow, plug a=1 into equation 4:\n\n3(1) + b = 3 --> 3 + b = 3 --> b = 0\n\nNow, plug a=1 and b=0 into equation 1:\n\n1 + 0 + c = 3 --> c = 2\n\nSo, the formula is a(n) = n\u00b2 + 0n + 2 = n\u00b2 + 2.\n\nLet me test this formula with the given numbers:\n\nFor n=1: 1\u00b2 + 2 = 3 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=2: 4 + 2 = 6 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=3: 9 + 2 = 11 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=4: 16 + 2 = 18 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nn=5: 25 + 2 = 27 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nPerfect, the formula holds for all given terms. So, the next term when n=6 would be 6\u00b2 + 2 = 36 + 2 = 38.\n\nAlternatively, I could have noticed that the differences are increasing by 2 each time, which is characteristic of a quadratic sequence where the second difference is constant. Since the second difference here is 2, the formula is quadratic, and we found a(n) = n\u00b2 + 2.\n\nSo, both methods lead me to the same conclusion: the next number in the sequence is 38.\n</think>\n\nThe sequence is defined by a quadratic formula a(n) = n\u00b2 + 2. Calculating for n=6 gives:\n\n6\u00b2 + 2 = 36 + 2 = 38.\n\n**Answer:** 38\n\nDONE."
