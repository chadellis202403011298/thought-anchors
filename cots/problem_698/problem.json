  "question": "A small fishing village relies on a local lake for its fish supply. When the village had just 50 residents, each person could catch 10 fish per day without affecting the fish population. As the village grew to 100 residents, they noticed the average catch per person dropped to 8 fish per day. When the population reached 150 residents, the average catch fell further to 5 fish per day. If this trend continues in the same nonlinear pattern, how many fish per day would each person be able to catch if the village population reaches 200 residents?",
  "answer": "This problem involves a nonlinear relationship between the village population and the fish catch per person.\n\nStep 1: Identify the given data points:\n- 50 residents: 10 fish per person per day\n- 100 residents: 8 fish per person per day\n- 150 residents: 5 fish per person per day\n\nStep 2: Analyze the pattern to determine the relationship.\nLet's examine how the fish catch decreases as population increases:\n- From 50 to 100 residents (increase of 50): catch decreases from 10 to 8 (decrease of 2)\n- From 100 to 150 residents (increase of 50): catch decreases from 8 to 5 (decrease of 3)\n\nStep 3: Notice that the decrease is accelerating in a nonlinear fashion. The decrease gets larger with each population increment of 50 people.\n- First decrease: 2 fish\n- Second decrease: 3 fish\n- Third decrease (projected): 4 fish\n\nStep 4: Calculate the expected fish catch at 200 residents.\nStarting from 5 fish per person at 150 residents, we expect a decrease of 4 fish when adding 50 more residents (reaching 200).\n\nTherefore, at 200 residents, each person would catch: 5 - 4 = 1 fish per day.\n\nThis illustrates a nonlinear system where the resource depletion accelerates as the population increases, demonstrating a common pattern in environmental systems where overexploitation leads to rapidly diminishing returns."
