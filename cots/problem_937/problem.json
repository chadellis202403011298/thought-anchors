  "question": "A marine biologist has observed that a certain species of coral appears to grow faster in areas with moderate water flow compared to areas with either very low or very high water flow. To develop a scientific theory explaining this phenomenon, the biologist needs to follow proper scientific reasoning principles. From the following potential next steps, which one represents the most appropriate approach in the theory development process?\n\nA) Immediately publish findings stating that moderate water flow causes faster coral growth\nB) Formulate a specific hypothesis about why moderate water flow might lead to faster growth and design controlled experiments to test it\nC) Conclude that all coral species must grow best in moderate water flow conditions\nD) Reject all previous theories about coral growth and create an entirely new framework based solely on this observation",
  "answer": "The correct answer is B) Formulate a specific hypothesis about why moderate water flow might lead to faster growth and design controlled experiments to test it.\n\nReasoning through this problem:\n\n1. In scientific theory development, a single observation should lead to hypothesis formation, not immediate conclusions or broad generalizations.\n\n2. Option A jumps directly to publishing a causal relationship without proper testing. This skips the crucial steps of hypothesis formation and experimental verification, violating the scientific method.\n\n3. Option C makes an unjustified generalization from one species to all coral species, committing the fallacy of hasty generalization. A proper theory development requires testing across multiple species before making such broad claims.\n\n4. Option D suggests an extreme response of rejecting all previous knowledge based on a single observation, which is not how science progresses. Scientific advancement typically builds upon existing knowledge rather than completely discarding it.\n\n5. Option B correctly follows the scientific method by taking the initial observation and using it to formulate a testable hypothesis, followed by designing controlled experiments to test that hypothesis. This represents the appropriate next step in theory development as it:\n   - Acknowledges the preliminary nature of the observation\n   - Creates a testable explanation (hypothesis)\n   - Proposes to gather evidence through controlled experimentation\n   - Sets up the conditions for potentially developing a more robust theory if the hypothesis is consistently supported"
