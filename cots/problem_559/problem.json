  "question": "A man lives on the 10th floor of an apartment building. Every morning, he takes the elevator down to the lobby and leaves for work. When he returns in the evening, he takes the elevator to the 7th floor and walks up the stairs to his apartment on the 10th floor. However, on rainy days, he takes the elevator all the way to the 10th floor. Why does he do this?",
  "answer": "The man is of short stature and cannot reach the button for the 10th floor in the elevator. He can only reach the buttons up to the 7th floor. On rainy days, he has an umbrella with him, which he can use to press the 10th-floor button. This insight problem requires lateral thinking because the initial assumption is often that there's something wrong with the elevator or that the man has an unusual preference. The solution requires shifting perspective to consider the man's physical limitations and how they might be overcome in certain circumstances (having an umbrella). The key insight is recognizing that the umbrella serves a different purpose than its typical use of protection from rain."
