  "answer": "Let's prove by contradiction that there is no smallest positive real number.\n\n1. Assume the opposite of what we want to prove: Let's assume there is a smallest positive real number. Call it s.\n\n2. Since s is a positive real number, we can consider the number s/2. Since s > 0, we know that s/2 > 0, so s/2 is also a positive real number.\n\n3. Compare s and s/2:\n   s/2 = 0.5 \u00d7 s\n   Since 0.5 < 1, we have s/2 < s\n\n4. This means s/2 is a positive real number that is smaller than s.\n\n5. But this contradicts our initial assumption that s is the smallest positive real number!\n\n6. Since our assumption led to a contradiction, the assumption must be false.\n\n7. Therefore, there is no smallest positive real number.\n\nThis proof demonstrates a key property of the real number system - between any real number and zero, there are infinitely many real numbers, with no 'first' one after zero."
