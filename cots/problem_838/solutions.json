Hmm, okay. Let me start by understanding what this means. \n\nFirst, what is a positive real number? It's any number greater than zero on the number line. So, we're talking about numbers like 0.1, 1, 2.5, and so on. Now, the statement is that there's no smallest positive real number. That means, for any positive real number you pick, there's always another positive real number that's smaller. \n\nWait, but isn't zero the smallest real number? But zero isn't positive, it's zero. So, we're looking for something just above zero, but still, there's no end to how small it can get. Like, you can get as close to zero as you want, but you never actually reach zero. So, there's no minimum.\n\nBut how do I prove this using proof by contradiction? Proof by contradiction assumes that the opposite of what we want is true and then shows that it leads to a contradiction. So, if I assume that there is a smallest positive real number, let's call it x. Then, I need to show that this assumption leads to a contradiction.\n\nOkay, so let's set this up. Assume that x is the smallest positive real number. That means x is greater than zero, so x > 0. Now, if x is the smallest, then x should be less than or equal to any other positive real number. But wait, I think I need to formalize that. \n\nIf I take any other positive real number y, then y must be greater than or equal to x. So, y >= x. But here's the thing: since y is just some positive real number, I can choose y to be x/2. Is x/2 a positive real number? Yes, because x is positive, so dividing by 2 keeps it positive. \n\nSo, if I choose y = x/2, then according to the assumption, y should be greater than or equal to x. That is, x/2 >= x. Hmm, let me write that down: x/2 >= x. If I multiply both sides by 2, I get x >= 2x. Subtracting x from both sides, 0 >= x. But wait, that means x <= 0. But we already know that x is a positive real number, so x > 0. So, this leads to a contradiction because x cannot be both greater than zero and less than or equal to zero at the same time.\n\nTherefore, our initial assumption that there exists a smallest positive real number must be false. Hence, there is no smallest positive real number.\n\nWait, let me double-check. If x is the smallest, then x/2 should be greater than or equal to x? That seems counterintuitive because x/2 is actually smaller than x. So, if y = x/2, then y is smaller than x, which contradicts the assumption that x is the smallest. So, yeah, that makes sense.\n\nAnother way to think about it is using the concept of limits. As you keep dividing x by 2, you can get infinitely small numbers, which means there's no smallest positive number because you can always make it smaller. But the contradiction approach is more formal.\n\nI think I have it. The contradiction arises because assuming the existence of a smallest positive number leads us to conclude that it's not positive, which is a contradiction. Therefore, no such number can exist.\n</think>\n\nDONE."

Hmm, let me think about this. \n\nFirst, I know that real numbers are uncountably infinite, which means they can't be listed out in a sequence like natural numbers. But how does that relate to having a smallest positive real number? Well, if there were a smallest positive real number, let's call it 's', then every positive real number should be greater than or equal to 's'. That makes sense, right? \n\nBut wait, if 's' is the smallest, then what happens when we consider the number 's/2'? Since 's' is the smallest, 's/2' should be less than 's'. But 's/2' is also a positive real number. That contradicts the assumption that 's' is the smallest. \n\nSo, I can start by assuming that there is a smallest positive real number, say 's'. Then, by dividing 's' by 2, we get 's/2', which is also a positive real number and is smaller than 's'. That's a contradiction because 's' was supposed to be the smallest. \n\nTherefore, our initial assumption must be wrong, meaning there is no smallest positive real number. \n\nWait, does this cover all possibilities? What if someone says there is a smallest number in some interval? Like, maybe in [0,1], there's a smallest number? But no, because for any interval, you can always halve it, and there will be a smaller number in the next interval. So, it's not just about [0,1], it's about the entire set of positive real numbers. \n\nAlso, thinking about it another way, if there were a smallest positive real number, you could keep dividing it by 2 indefinitely, which would mean you have an infinite sequence of smaller and smaller numbers, all positive. But that contradicts the idea of 's' being the smallest. \n\nSo, yeah, the contradiction arises because you can always find a smaller positive real number by halving the supposed smallest one. Therefore, there can't be a smallest positive real number.\n</think>\n\nThere is no smallest positive real number. Suppose, for contradiction, that there exists a smallest positive real number \\( s \\). Consider \\( \\frac{s}{2} \\), which is also a positive real number and less than \\( s \\), contradicting the assumption that \\( s \\) is the smallest. Hence, no smallest positive real number exists.\n\nDONE."

Hmm, let me think about this. \n\nFirst, what does it mean for a number to be the smallest positive real number? Well, if such a number existed, it would be the minimum of all positive real numbers. But I remember from math class that the real numbers go on infinitely in both the positive and negative directions. So, if we're talking about positive real numbers, they start from zero and go upwards without ever ending. \n\nWait, but zero isn't positive, right? Positive numbers are numbers greater than zero. So, if we consider the set of all positive real numbers, it's like an interval (0, \u221e). Now, the question is, does this interval have a smallest element? \n\nI think in some contexts, like in the set of natural numbers, zero isn't considered, but here we're dealing with real numbers, which are dense and uncountable. That means between any two real numbers, no matter how close, there's another real number. So, if I assume that there is a smallest positive real number, let's call it x, then I can probably find a number smaller than x, which would contradict the assumption that x is the smallest. \n\nLet me try to formalize this. Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that there exists a smallest positive real number x. That means x is greater than zero, and for any other positive real number y, y is greater than or equal to x. So, x is the infimum of the set of positive real numbers. \n\nBut wait, in real numbers, the infimum of a set doesn't have to be an actual element of the set unless the set is closed. The set of positive real numbers is open, so it doesn't contain its infimum. That means there's no smallest positive real number because you can always find a number smaller than any given positive number. \n\nFor example, take x as the supposed smallest number. Then x/2 is smaller than x and still positive. But x/2 is also a positive real number, which contradicts the idea that x is the smallest. This process can be repeated indefinitely, always finding a smaller number. \n\nSo, by assuming that such a smallest number exists, we've arrived at a contradiction because we can always find a smaller number. Therefore, our initial assumption must be wrong, and there is no smallest positive real number. \n\nI think that makes sense. The key idea is that between any two real numbers, no matter how close, there's another real number. So, you can always find a number that's smaller than the one you're considering as the smallest. This shows that the idea of a smallest positive real number is impossible because it leads to an endless process of finding smaller and smaller numbers without ever reaching a minimum.\n</think>\n\nThere is no smallest positive real number because assuming such a number exists leads to a contradiction. If x were the smallest positive real number, then x/2 would be smaller than x, which contradicts the assumption that x is the smallest. This infinite descent implies that no smallest positive real number can exist.\n\nDONE."

Hmm, okay. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that real numbers are dense, meaning between any two real numbers, there's another real number. So, for any positive real number I pick, there's always a smaller one. That makes me think that maybe there's no smallest one because you can always find a smaller number.\n\nBut how do I formalize this idea? Well, the problem suggests using proof by contradiction. So, I should assume the opposite of what I want to prove and then show that this assumption leads to a contradiction.\n\nLet me define what I mean by \"smallest positive real number.\" If such a number exists, let's call it 's'. So, 's' is greater than 0, and for any other positive real number 'x', 's' is less than or equal to 'x'. In mathematical terms, s > 0 and s \u2264 x for all x > 0.\n\nNow, if I assume that 's' is the smallest positive real number, then it must satisfy the condition that there's no real number smaller than 's'. But wait, I remember that real numbers can be as small as you like, approaching zero but never actually reaching zero. So, if 's' is the smallest, there shouldn't be any number smaller than 's', but I can always find a number that's smaller by halving 's', right?\n\nLet me try to make this precise. Suppose 's' is the smallest positive real number. Then, by definition, s > 0, and for any x > 0, s \u2264 x. Now, take a number that's half of 's', which is s/2. Is s/2 a positive real number? Yes, because s > 0, so s/2 is also greater than 0. But then, s/2 is less than 's' because s/2 = (1/2)s < s. This contradicts our assumption that 's' is the smallest positive real number because we've found a smaller number, s/2.\n\nWait, is this a valid contradiction? I think so. If 's' is supposed to be the smallest, then no number should be smaller than it, but we've found s/2 which is smaller. Therefore, our initial assumption that such an 's' exists must be wrong. Hence, there is no smallest positive real number.\n\nBut let me double-check if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using the concept of infimum. The infimum of the set of positive real numbers is 0, but 0 isn't a real number. So, the infimum doesn't exist within the set of positive real numbers, which means there's no smallest positive real number.\n\nYes, that aligns with the contradiction approach. By assuming there's a smallest number, we can always find a smaller one, leading us to the conclusion that such a smallest number can't exist.\n\nI think that covers it. So, in summary, assuming the existence of a smallest positive real number leads us to the existence of a smaller number, which is a contradiction. Therefore, there is no smallest positive real number.\n</think>\n\nThere is no smallest positive real number because assuming such a number exists leads to a contradiction. If 's' were the smallest, then 's/2' would be smaller, which is impossible. Hence, no smallest positive real number exists.\n\nDONE."

Hmm, okay, let me think about this.\n\nFirst off, what does it mean to have a smallest positive real number? Well, if such a number existed, let's call it 'x'. Now, 'x' would have to be greater than zero because we're talking about positive real numbers. Also, it should be the smallest possible, meaning there's no other positive real number smaller than 'x'.\n\nBut wait, I remember something about real numbers being uncountably infinite. That is, between any two real numbers, there's another real number. So if I take any two positive real numbers, say 'a' and 'b' where 'a < b', there's always another number 'c' such that 'a < c < b'. \n\nSo, if there were a smallest positive real number 'x', then by the same logic, I can take a number just a tiny bit bigger than 'x', right? Like, 'x + \u03b5', where \u03b5 is a very small positive number. But wait, that would mean 'x' isn't the smallest anymore because there's another number smaller than 'x + \u03b5'. Hmm, maybe I'm on the right track here.\n\nBut how does this lead to a contradiction? Let me formalize this a bit. Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that there exists a smallest positive real number 'x'. Then, by the density of real numbers, there exists a number 'y' such that '0 < y < x'. But if 'y' is between 0 and 'x', then 'y' is smaller than 'x', which contradicts the assumption that 'x' is the smallest positive real number. \n\nWait, is that the full argument? It seems a bit too straightforward. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. If 'x' is the smallest, then no number less than 'x' should exist. But because real numbers are dense, that's impossible. So, the assumption that 'x' exists must be wrong. Therefore, there is no smallest positive real number.\n\nYeah, that makes sense. So, by assuming that a smallest positive real number exists, we can always find a smaller one, which contradicts the assumption. Hence, no smallest positive real number exists.\n</think>\n\nThere is no smallest positive real number because assuming such a number exists leads to a contradiction. If 'x' were the smallest, a number between 0 and 'x' would always exist, contradicting 'x's minimality. Thus, no smallest positive real number exists.\n\nDONE."

Hmm, I need to figure out how to approach this. Let me start by recalling what a proof by contradiction is. It's a method where you assume the opposite of what you want to prove and then show that this assumption leads to a contradiction. If I can show that assuming there is a smallest positive real number leads to a contradiction, then the original statement must be false. That makes sense.\n\nAlright, so first, let me define what a positive real number is. A positive real number is any number greater than zero on the number line. Now, the problem is about finding the smallest one. At first glance, it seems like there should be a smallest positive real number because numbers get larger and larger without bound. But wait, in mathematics, especially in real numbers, things are a bit different because they go on forever in both directions, right?\n\nLet me think about integers for a moment. If I were to look for the smallest positive integer, that would be 1, right? Because all positive integers are 1, 2, 3, and so on. So 1 is the smallest. But real numbers are different because they are dense. Between any two real numbers, no matter how close, there's another real number. So maybe there isn't a smallest positive real number because for any number I pick, I can always find a smaller one.\n\nWait, but how do I formalize that? I need to assume that there is a smallest positive real number and then show that this leads to a contradiction. Let's call this smallest positive real number 's'. So, by definition, s is greater than zero, and for any other positive real number x, x is greater than or equal to s.\n\nNow, if I take s and subtract a very small positive number from it, say \u03b5 (epsilon), where \u03b5 is greater than zero but much smaller than s, what happens? If s is the smallest, then s - \u03b5 should be less than s. But wait, s - \u03b5 is still positive because s is greater than \u03b5. So now I have a number that's smaller than s, which contradicts the idea that s is the smallest. Therefore, my assumption that there is a smallest positive real number must be wrong.\n\nHold on, let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Is there a way to make \u03b5 depend on s? Maybe take \u03b5 as 1/(2n) where n is a positive integer. Wait, but s is a real number, not necessarily an integer. Hmm, perhaps I should think about it differently. Instead of subtracting a fixed \u03b5, I can consider that for any s, there exists a number between 0 and s. But since s is supposed to be the smallest, that can't happen. \n\nAlternatively, I can use the concept of limits. If I take a sequence approaching zero, like 1/n for each positive integer n, then each term is smaller than the previous one. But since there's no smallest positive real number, I can always find a number between 0 and s, which is supposed to be the smallest. That seems to support my initial thought.\n\nAnother angle: think about the completeness property of real numbers, which states that every non-empty set bounded below has an infimum. If I consider the set of all positive real numbers, it's bounded below by zero but doesn't have a minimum because for any supposed minimum, I can find a smaller number. So the infimum is zero, but zero isn't positive. Therefore, there's no smallest positive real number.\n\nWait, but how does this fit into proof by contradiction? Let me structure it properly. Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that there exists a smallest positive real number s. By definition, s is greater than zero, and for any x > 0, x \u2265 s. Now, consider the number s/2. Since s is positive, s/2 is also positive and less than s. But this contradicts the assumption that s is the smallest positive real number. Therefore, our initial assumption must be false, proving that there is no smallest positive real number.\n\nI think that's a solid argument. By assuming there is a smallest number, we can always find a smaller one, which is a contradiction. So, there can't be a smallest positive real number. I should make sure to present this clearly in my proof.\n</think>\n\nTo prove that there is no smallest positive real number using proof by contradiction, we proceed as follows:\n\n**Proof:**\n\nAssume, for the sake of contradiction, that there exists a smallest positive real number \\( s \\). By definition, \\( s > 0 \\), and for every positive real number \\( x \\), it holds that \\( x \\geq s \\).\n\nConsider the number \\( \\frac{s}{2} \\). Since \\( s > 0 \\), \\( \\frac{s}{2} \\) is also positive and satisfies \\( \\frac{s}{2} < s \\). This contradicts the assumption that \\( s \\) is the smallest positive real number because we have found a smaller positive real number \\( \\frac{s}{2} \\).\n\nTherefore, our initial assumption must be false. Hence, there is no smallest positive real number.\n\n**DONE.**"

Hmm, okay, let me start by understanding what the question is asking. It's saying that there isn't a smallest positive real number, which I sort of intuitively agree with because for any positive real number, I can always find a smaller one. But I need to formalize this thought process into a proof.\n\nProof by contradiction usually involves assuming the opposite of what you want to prove and then showing that this assumption leads to a contradiction. So, in this case, I should assume that there is a smallest positive real number, and then show that this leads to some impossible situation.\n\nLet me denote this smallest positive real number as 's'. By definition, s is greater than zero and less than or equal to any other positive real number. So, s > 0, and for any positive real number x, s \u2264 x. \n\nWait, but if s is the smallest, then there shouldn't be any positive real number smaller than s. So, if I can find a positive real number that's smaller than s, that would contradict the assumption that s is the smallest. \n\nHow can I find such a number? Maybe I can use the concept of division or fractions. If s is positive, then 1/s is also positive, right? Because dividing 1 by a positive number s gives another positive number. So, 1/s is positive.\n\nNow, is 1/s smaller than s? Let's check. If s > 1, then 1/s < 1, which is less than s. But if s is between 0 and 1, say s = 0.5, then 1/s = 2, which is greater than s. So, in that case, 1/s isn't smaller. Hmm, that's a problem. My initial thought was that 1/s would always be smaller, but it's not the case when s is between 0 and 1.\n\nWait, so maybe I need a different approach. Perhaps I can consider the reciprocal in a different way or use some properties of real numbers. Let me think about the density of real numbers. Between any two real numbers, there's another real number. So, if I have s, there should be a number between 0 and s, right?\n\nBut how do I construct such a number? Maybe I can use the concept of taking half of s. If s is positive, then s/2 is also positive and less than s. So, s/2 is a positive real number smaller than s. That seems promising.\n\nBut hold on, is s/2 really smaller than s? Yes, because if you divide a positive number by 2, it becomes half its original value. So, s/2 < s. Therefore, I've found a positive real number, s/2, that's smaller than s, which contradicts the assumption that s is the smallest positive real number.\n\nWait, but what if s is 0? No, because 0 isn't positive. The problem specifies positive real numbers, so s must be greater than 0. Therefore, s/2 is always a positive real number smaller than s, which means our initial assumption that s is the smallest positive real number must be false. Hence, there is no smallest positive real number.\n\nI think that makes sense. By assuming there is a smallest positive real number, we can always find a smaller positive real number by halving it, leading to a contradiction. Therefore, our initial assumption is wrong, and there cannot be a smallest positive real number.\n</think>\n\nThere is no smallest positive real number because assuming the existence of such a number leads to a contradiction. If \\( s \\) were the smallest positive real number, then \\( \\frac{s}{2} \\) would be a positive real number smaller than \\( s \\), contradicting the assumption that \\( s \\) is the smallest.

Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that proof by contradiction works by assuming the opposite of what we want to prove and then showing that this assumption leads to a contradiction. So, in this case, I should assume that there exists a smallest positive real number and then show that this leads to a contradiction.\n\nLet me define what I mean by a \"positive real number.\" A positive real number is any number greater than zero on the number line. So, if we say there's a smallest one, let's call it 's'. By definition, 's' should be greater than zero, and any other positive real number should be larger than 's'. But wait, if 's' is the smallest, then there shouldn't be any positive real number smaller than 's'.\n\nNow, here's where I'm a bit confused. If 's' is the smallest, then it's the infimum of the positive real numbers. But I also remember that the set of positive real numbers doesn't have a smallest element because for any number you pick, no matter how small, there's always a smaller one. That seems contradictory. Maybe that's the contradiction I need to find.\n\nSo, let's set this up more formally. Assume that there exists a smallest positive real number, which we'll denote as 's'. Since 's' is a positive real number, we know that 0 < s. Also, by the definition of being the smallest, there should be no positive real number less than 's'. That means for any positive real number 'x', x \u2265 s.\n\nBut wait, here's the kicker. If 's' is the smallest, then it should satisfy the condition that there's no number smaller than 's'. However, I recall that in the real numbers, between any two numbers, there's another number. So, if I take 's' and subtract a tiny positive number from it, I should get a number smaller than 's'. But that number would still be positive because 's' is positive and I'm subtracting a small positive number. That means my assumption that 's' is the smallest is wrong because I can always find a smaller positive number.\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. If 's' is the smallest, then by definition, there's no positive real number less than 's'. But if I take 's' and subtract, say, 0.5*s from it, I get s - 0.5*s = 0.5*s, which is still positive and less than 's'. That directly contradicts the assumption that 's' is the smallest. So, that's a clear contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the concept of infimum. The infimum of a set is the greatest lower bound. For the set of positive real numbers, the infimum is 0, not any positive number. So, if 's' were the infimum, it would have to be 0, but 0 isn't positive. Hence, there's no smallest positive real number because the infimum is 0, which isn't positive.\n\nAnother way to look at it is by considering the density of real numbers. Between any two positive real numbers, there's another positive real number. So, if I pick a number 's', no matter how small, I can always find a number 't' such that 0 < t < s. This means 's' isn't actually the smallest, leading to a contradiction.\n\nI think I've got it now. The key idea is that assuming a smallest positive real number leads us to the conclusion that there's a smaller positive number, which contradicts our initial assumption. Therefore, our initial assumption must be false, meaning there is no smallest positive real number.\n</think>\n\nThere is no smallest positive real number because assuming such a number exists leads to a contradiction. If 's' were the smallest positive real number, subtracting a smaller positive number from 's' would yield a number smaller than 's', which contradicts the assumption that 's' is the smallest. Hence, no smallest positive real number exists.\n\nDONE."

Hmm, okay. Let me think about this step by step. \n\nFirst, I know that real numbers are uncountably infinite, right? So, they go on forever in both the positive and negative directions. Now, the question is about positive real numbers. So, we're talking about numbers like 0.1, 1, 10, 100, and so on, all the way up to infinity.\n\nThe statement says there is no smallest positive real number. At first glance, this might seem a bit confusing because I can think of numbers getting smaller and smaller, approaching zero. But zero isn't a positive real number, it's just zero. So, maybe the idea is that you can always find a smaller positive number, no matter how small you go.\n\nLet me try to approach this using proof by contradiction. Proof by contradiction works by assuming the opposite of what we want to prove and then showing that this leads to a contradiction. So, in this case, I'll assume that there is a smallest positive real number. Let's call this number 'x'.\n\nSo, my assumption is: There exists a smallest positive real number x, such that x > 0 and for all y > 0, y \u2260 x, x < y. Wait, no, that's not quite right. More accurately, for any positive real number y, either y > x or y = x. But since we're looking for the smallest, it should be that x is less than or equal to any other positive real number. But since x is positive and we can have numbers approaching zero, maybe I need to refine this.\n\nWait, actually, if x is the smallest positive real number, then x should be less than or equal to every other positive real number. So, for any y > 0, x \u2264 y. But since x is positive, it can't be zero. So, x > 0, and for all y > 0, x \u2264 y.\n\nNow, let's think about the real numbers between 0 and x. For example, if x is 1, then there's 0.5, 0.25, 0.125, and so on. But if x is supposed to be the smallest, then there shouldn't be any positive real number smaller than x. But that's not possible because we can always divide x by 2, which is still a positive real number and smaller than x. \n\nSo, if I take x and divide it by 2, I get x/2, which is still positive and less than x. That contradicts the assumption that x is the smallest positive real number because I've found a number smaller than x. Therefore, my initial assumption must be wrong. Hence, there is no smallest positive real number.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing something. Suppose someone says that the smallest number is zero, but zero isn't positive. So, the next candidate is any number greater than zero. But as I thought earlier, you can always find a number half of that, which is still positive and smaller. So, no matter how small you pick, I can always go smaller. Therefore, there's no minimum.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the contradiction arises because assuming a smallest positive real number leads to the existence of a smaller number, which isn't possible. Therefore, the assumption is false, and there is no smallest positive real number.\n</think>\n\nThere is no smallest positive real number because assuming such a number exists leads to a contradiction. If x were the smallest positive real number, then x/2 would be a smaller positive real number, which contradicts the assumption that x is the smallest. Therefore, no smallest positive real number exists.\n\nDONE."

End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: Prove that there is no smallest positive real number using the method of proof by contradiction. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I need to prove that there is no smallest positive real number using proof by contradiction. Hmm, okay. Let me think about this. I remember that proof by contradiction is a method where you assume the opposite of what you want to prove, and then show that this assumption leads to a contradiction. That way, the original assumption must be false, so the opposite is true.\n\nSo, in this case, I need to assume that there is a smallest positive real number, and then show that this leads to a contradiction. Let me define that number. Let's call it 's'. So, s is the smallest positive real number. Now, if s is the smallest, then it must be less than or equal to any other positive real number, right? Because if there were a number smaller than s, it would contradict the idea that s is the smallest.\n\nOkay, so s is positive, and s is less than or equal to any other positive real number. Now, I remember something about the density of real numbers. That is, between any two real numbers, there's another real number. So, for example, if I take any two numbers like 1 and 2, there's 1.5 in between. But how does that help me here?\n\nMaybe I can use the concept of division. If s is the smallest positive real number, then dividing s by 2 should give me a number that's smaller than s. Let me write that down: s/2 < s. That makes sense because if you divide a number by 2, it's half as big, so it should be smaller.\n\nBut wait, if s/2 is smaller than s, then that contradicts the idea that s is the smallest positive real number. Because s/2 is also positive and smaller than s, which means s can't be the smallest. So, this contradiction shows that our initial assumption that there is a smallest positive real number must be false.\n\nLet me make sure I'm not missing anything here. So, assuming there is a smallest positive real number s leads us to s/2, which is also positive and smaller than s. Therefore, s can't be the smallest, which contradicts the assumption. Hence, no smallest positive real number exists.\n\nI think that covers it. The key point is that for any positive real number, dividing it by 2 gives a smaller positive real number, which means there's always a number smaller than it. So, there's no smallest one.\n</think>\n\nTo prove that there is no smallest positive real number, we use proof by contradiction. Assume such a number exists, denoted as \\( s \\). Then \\( s \\) is less than or equal to any other positive real number. However, dividing \\( s \\) by 2 yields \\( s/2 \\), which is smaller than \\( s \\), contradicting the assumption that \\( s \\) is the smallest. Therefore, no smallest positive real number exists.\n\nDONE."
