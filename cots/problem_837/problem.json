  "question": "A small company has three departments: Marketing (with 5 employees), Development (with 8 employees), and Customer Service (with 7 employees). The company plans to randomly select one employee to represent the company at a local business conference. If an employee is selected from the Marketing department, they receive a $50 bonus. If selected from Development, they receive a $30 bonus. If selected from Customer Service, they receive a $40 bonus. What is the expected value of the bonus that will be given to the randomly selected employee?",
  "answer": "To solve this problem, we need to find the expected value of a random variable (the bonus amount) by identifying the possible values and their probabilities.\n\nStep 1: Identify the total number of employees.\nTotal employees = 5 (Marketing) + 8 (Development) + 7 (Customer Service) = 20 employees\n\nStep 2: Determine the probability of selecting an employee from each department.\nP(Marketing) = 5/20 = 1/4 = 0.25\nP(Development) = 8/20 = 2/5 = 0.40\nP(Customer Service) = 7/20 = 7/20 = 0.35\n\nStep 3: Identify the values of the random variable (bonus amounts).\nBonus for Marketing = $50\nBonus for Development = $30\nBonus for Customer Service = $40\n\nStep 4: Calculate the expected value using the formula: E(X) = \u03a3(x_i \u00d7 P(x_i))\nE(X) = $50 \u00d7 0.25 + $30 \u00d7 0.40 + $40 \u00d7 0.35\nE(X) = $12.50 + $12.00 + $14.00\nE(X) = $38.50\n\nTherefore, the expected value of the bonus is $38.50."
