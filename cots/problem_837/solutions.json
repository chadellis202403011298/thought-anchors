The company plans to randomly select one employee to represent the company at a local business conference. If an employee is selected from the Marketing department, they receive a $50 bonus. If selected from Development, they receive a $30 bonus. If selected from Customer Service, they receive a $40 bonus. What is the expected value of the bonus that will be given to the randomly selected employee? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out the expected value of the bonus for this company. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the company has three departments: Marketing, Development, and Customer Service. Each department has a certain number of employees. Specifically, Marketing has 5 employees, Development has 8, and Customer Service has 7. So, in total, how many employees are there? Let me add them up: 5 + 8 is 13, and then plus 7 is 20. So, there are 20 employees in total.\n\nNow, the company is going to randomly select one employee to represent them at a conference. Depending on which department the employee comes from, they'll receive a different bonus. If it's Marketing, the bonus is $50, Development gives $30, and Customer Service gives $40. I need to find the expected value of this bonus.\n\nHmm, expected value. I remember that expected value is like the average outcome we'd expect if we did this selection many times. So, it's calculated by multiplying each possible outcome by its probability and then summing those products up.\n\nLet me think about how to structure this. There are three possible bonuses: $50, $30, and $40. Each of these corresponds to selecting an employee from Marketing, Development, or Customer Service, respectively. So, the probability of selecting an employee from each department will determine each bonus's contribution to the expected value.\n\nSince the selection is random, I assume it's equally likely to pick any employee. That means the probability of selecting an employee from a particular department is proportional to the number of employees in that department. So, for Marketing, the probability is the number of employees in Marketing divided by the total number of employees, which is 5/20. Similarly, for Development, it's 8/20, and for Customer Service, it's 7/20.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\n- Probability of selecting Marketing = 5/20\n- Probability of selecting Development = 8/20\n- Probability of selecting Customer Service = 7/20\n\nI can simplify these fractions:\n\n- 5/20 is 1/4\n- 8/20 is 2/5\n- 7/20 remains as is, which is 7/20.\n\nOkay, so the expected value (E) can be calculated as:\n\nE = (Probability of Marketing * $50) + (Probability of Development * $30) + (Probability of Customer Service * $40)\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nE = (5/20 * 50) + (8/20 * 30) + (7/20 * 40)\n\nWait, actually, since I've already simplified the probabilities:\n\nE = (1/4 * 50) + (2/5 * 30) + (7/20 * 40)\n\nLet me compute each term step by step.\n\nFirst term: (1/4) * 50. 1/4 of 50 is 12.5.\n\nSecond term: (2/5) * 30. Let's see, 2 divided by 5 is 0.4, and 0.4 times 30 is 12.\n\nThird term: (7/20) * 40. 7 divided by 20 is 0.35, and 0.35 times 40 is 14.\n\nNow, add those three results together: 12.5 + 12 + 14.\n\n12.5 + 12 is 24.5, and 24.5 + 14 is 38.5.\n\nSo, the expected value is $38.5.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst term: 1/4 of 50 is indeed 12.5.\n\nSecond term: 2/5 of 30. 2/5 is 0.4, 0.4 * 30 is 12. That's correct.\n\nThird term: 7/20 of 40. 7/20 is 0.35, 0.35 * 40 is 14. That's right.\n\nAdding them up: 12.5 + 12 = 24.5; 24.5 + 14 = 38.5.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I could compute it using the total number of employees. Since each employee has an equal chance of being selected, the expected bonus is the sum of each department's bonus multiplied by the number of employees in that department, all divided by the total number of employees.\n\nSo, using that approach:\n\nE = (5 * 50 + 8 * 30 + 7 * 40) / 20\n\nLet's compute the numerator:\n\n5 * 50 = 250\n\n8 * 30 = 240\n\n7 * 40 = 280\n\nAdding those together: 250 + 240 is 490, plus 280 is 770.\n\nSo, E = 770 / 20 = 38.5\n\nYep, same result.\n\nSo, the expected value is $38.5.\n\nBut wait, the question asks for the expected value, and it's common to present it as a decimal or a fraction. Since 0.5 is half, we could express it as $38.50 or $38\u00bd. But in terms of a numerical value, $38.5 is acceptable.\n\nI think that's it. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that the expected value is $38.5.\n</think>\n\nThe expected value of the bonus is calculated by multiplying each department's bonus by the probability of selecting an employee from that department and summing the results.\n\n- Marketing: (5/20) * $50 = $12.50\n- Development: (8/20) * $30 = $12.00\n- Customer Service: (7/20) * $40 = $14.00\n\nSumming these: $12.50 + $12.00 + $14.00 = $38.50.\n\nDONE."

If selected from Development, they receive a $30 bonus. If selected from Customer Service, they receive a $40 bonus. What is the expected value of the bonus that will be given to the randomly selected employee? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this problem here about a small company with three departments: Marketing, Development, and Customer Service. Each department has a different number of employees and offers a different bonus if an employee is selected to represent the company at a conference. I need to find the expected value of the bonus. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. The company has three departments:\n\n1. **Marketing Department**: 5 employees.\n2. **Development Department**: 8 employees.\n3. **Customer Service Department**: 7 employees.\n\nThey plan to randomly select one employee to attend the conference. Depending on which department the employee is from, they receive a different bonus:\n\n- If selected from **Marketing**, they get a $50 bonus.\n- If selected from **Development**, they get a $30 bonus.\n- If selected from **Customer Service**, they get a $40 bonus.\n\nSo, I need to calculate the expected value of the bonus. I remember that expected value is like the average outcome we would expect if we were to repeat this selection many times. It's calculated by multiplying each possible outcome by its probability and then summing all those values.\n\nTo find the expected value (E), the formula is:\n\n\\[ E = \\sum (x_i \\times P(x_i)) \\]\n\nWhere \\( x_i \\) are the possible outcomes (in this case, the bonuses) and \\( P(x_i) \\) is the probability of each outcome.\n\nSo, first, I need to figure out the probability of selecting an employee from each department. Since the selection is random, each employee has an equal chance of being chosen. Therefore, the probability of selecting an employee from a particular department is equal to the number of employees in that department divided by the total number of employees in the company.\n\nLet me calculate the total number of employees first.\n\nTotal employees = Marketing + Development + Customer Service\nTotal employees = 5 + 8 + 7 = 20 employees.\n\nOkay, so there are 20 employees in total. Now, the probability of selecting an employee from each department is:\n\n- Probability of selecting Marketing: \\( \\frac{5}{20} = \\frac{1}{4} \\) or 0.25\n- Probability of selecting Development: \\( \\frac{8}{20} = \\frac{2}{5} \\) or 0.4\n- Probability of selecting Customer Service: \\( \\frac{7}{20} = \\frac{7}{20} \\) or 0.35\n\nLet me double-check that these probabilities add up to 1:\n\n0.25 + 0.4 + 0.35 = 1.0\n\nYes, that looks correct. Good, so the probabilities are accurate.\n\nNow, the next step is to multiply each bonus amount by its respective probability and then sum them all up.\n\nLet me write that out:\n\nExpected value (E) = (Marketing bonus * Probability of Marketing) + (Development bonus * Probability of Development) + (Customer Service bonus * Probability of Customer Service)\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nE = (50 * 0.25) + (30 * 0.4) + (40 * 0.35)\n\nLet me calculate each term one by one.\n\nFirst term: 50 * 0.25\nI know that 50 multiplied by 0.25 is 12.5 because 0.25 is a quarter, and a quarter of 50 is 12.5.\n\nSecond term: 30 * 0.4\n30 multiplied by 0.4 is 12. Because 0.4 is the same as 2/5, and 30 divided by 5 is 6, so 6*2 is 12.\n\nThird term: 40 * 0.35\nHmm, 40 multiplied by 0.35. Let me think. 0.35 is the same as 35/100, which simplifies to 7/20. So, 40 * 7/20. Well, 40 divided by 20 is 2, so 2*7 is 14.\n\nAlternatively, I can do 40 * 0.35 directly:\n\n40\n* 0.35\n--------\n14.00\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo, now I have all three terms:\n\n- First term: 12.5\n- Second term: 12\n- Third term: 14\n\nAdding them together:\n\n12.5 + 12 = 24.5\n\n24.5 + 14 = 38.5\n\nSo, the expected value is 38.5 dollars.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. It's easy to slip up with decimals.\n\nFirst term: 50 * 0.25 = 12.5 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSecond term: 30 * 0.4 = 12 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nThird term: 40 * 0.35 = 14 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nAdding them: 12.5 + 12 = 24.5; 24.5 + 14 = 38.5 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the expected value as a weighted average, where each department's bonus is weighted by the number of employees in that department.\n\nSo, Marketing has 5 employees, which is 1/4 of the company, Development has 8, which is 2/5, and Customer Service has 7, which is 7/20.\n\nExpressed as decimals:\n\n- Marketing: 5/20 = 0.25\n- Development: 8/20 = 0.4\n- Customer Service: 7/20 = 0.35\n\nSo, yeah, same probabilities.\n\nAnother way to approach it could be to list all possible outcomes and their bonuses, but that would be tedious since there are 20 employees. However, since each department has a certain number of employees, we can group them and multiply the number of employees by the bonus.\n\nBut in this case, since the selection is random and each employee has an equal chance, it's sufficient to consider the probability of selecting from each department rather than individual employees.\n\nSo, the key steps are:\n\n1. Calculate total number of employees.\n2. Determine the probability of selecting from each department.\n3. Multiply each bonus by its respective probability.\n4. Sum all the results to get the expected value.\n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the logic or calculations. So, the expected value is $38.50.\n\nWait, just to make sure, let me express 38.5 as a fraction to see if it makes sense. 38.5 is the same as 77/2, but that's not particularly meaningful here. Alternatively, if I wanted to present it as a fraction, but the question doesn't specify, so decimal is fine.\n\nAlternatively, I can also compute the expected value by thinking in terms of fractions instead of decimals to see if it comes out the same.\n\nSo, probabilities as fractions:\n\n- Marketing: 5/20 = 1/4\n- Development: 8/20 = 2/5\n- Customer Service: 7/20\n\nConvert each bonus multiplied by its fraction:\n\nE = 50*(1/4) + 30*(2/5) + 40*(7/20)\n\nCalculate each term:\n\n50*(1/4) = 12.5\n\n30*(2/5) = 12\n\n40*(7/20) = 14\n\nSame as before. So, 12.5 + 12 + 14 = 38.5\n\nYep, same result. So, that's reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, if I use fractions throughout:\n\nFirst term: 50*(1/4) = 50/4 = 12.5\n\nSecond term: 30*(2/5) = 60/5 = 12\n\nThird term: 40*(7/20) = 280/20 = 14\n\nSame as before, so 12.5 + 12 + 14 = 38.5\n\nSo, everything checks out.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I can't think of another way to approach this problem. It seems straightforward, and I've verified the calculations multiple times.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe expected value of the bonus is \\boxed{38.5} dollars.\nDONE.\n</think>\n\nThe company has three departments with the following number of employees and bonuses:\n\n1. **Marketing Department**: 5 employees, $50 bonus.\n2. **Development Department**: 8 employees, $30 bonus.\n3. **Customer Service Department**: 7 employees, $40 bonus.\n\nThe total number of employees is 5 + 8 + 7 = 20.\n\nThe probabilities of selecting an employee from each department are:\n\n- Probability of selecting Marketing: \\( \\frac{5}{20} = 0.25 \\)\n- Probability of selecting Development: \\( \\frac{8}{20} = 0.4 \\)\n- Probability of selecting Customer Service: \\( \\frac{7}{20} = 0.35 \\)\n\nThe expected value (E) is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[ E = (50 \\times 0.25) + (30 \\times 0.4) + (40 \\times 0.35) \\]\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n- First term: \\( 50 \\times 0.25 = 12.5 \\)\n- Second term: \\( 30 \\times 0.4 = 12 \\)\n- Third term: \\( 40 \\times 0.35 = 14 \\)\n\nSumming these values:\n\n\\[ E = 12.5 + 12 + 14 = 38.5 \\]\n\nThus, the expected value of the bonus is \\boxed{38.5} dollars."

If selected from Development, they receive a $30 bonus. If selected from Customer Service, they receive a $40 bonus. What is the expected value of the bonus that will be given to the randomly selected employee? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out the expected value of the bonus for this company. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that the company has three departments: Marketing, Development, and Customer Service. Each department has a different number of employees and different bonuses for being selected to represent the company at a conference.\n\nMarketing has 5 employees, Development has 8, and Customer Service has 7. So, the total number of employees is 5 + 8 + 7. Let me add those up: 5 + 8 is 13, and 13 + 7 is 20. So, there are 20 employees in total.\n\nNow, the company is going to randomly select one employee. That means each employee has an equal chance of being chosen. To find the expected value, I think I need to calculate the probability of selecting an employee from each department and then multiply each probability by the corresponding bonus. After that, I'll add all those values together to get the expected bonus.\n\nLet me write this down to visualize it better.\n\nThe probability of selecting an employee from Marketing is the number of employees in Marketing divided by the total number of employees. So that's 5/20. Similarly, for Development, it's 8/20, and for Customer Service, it's 7/20.\n\nSo, the expected value (EV) formula would be:\nEV = (Probability of Marketing * Bonus_Marketing) + (Probability of Development * Bonus_Development) + (Probability of Customer Service * Bonus_Customer Service)\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\nEV = (5/20 * $50) + (8/20 * $30) + (7/20 * $40)\n\nLet me calculate each part separately.\n\nFirst part: 5/20 * 50. Well, 5 divided by 20 is 0.25, and 0.25 times 50 is 12.5.\n\nSecond part: 8/20 * 30. 8 divided by 20 is 0.4, and 0.4 times 30 is 12.\n\nThird part: 7/20 * 40. 7 divided by 20 is 0.35, and 0.35 times 40 is 14.\n\nNow, adding those three results together: 12.5 + 12 is 24.5, and 24.5 + 14 is 38.5.\n\nSo, the expected value of the bonus is $38.50.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\n5/20 is 0.25, times 50 is indeed 12.5.\n\n8/20 is 0.4, times 30 is 12.\n\n7/20 is 0.35, times 40 is 14.\n\nAdding them: 12.5 + 12 is 24.5, plus 14 is 38.5. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as each department's bonus multiplied by their proportion of the total employees.\n\nMarketing: 5/20 = 1/4, so 1/4 of the total is 50. 1/4 of 50 is 12.5.\n\nDevelopment: 8/20 = 2/5, so 2/5 of 30 is 12.\n\nCustomer Service: 7/20 = 7/20, so 7/20 of 40 is 14.\n\nAdding them again: 12.5 + 12 + 14 is 38.5.\n\nHmm, seems consistent. So, I think I did this correctly.\n\nAnother way to approach it is to convert all fractions to decimals first before multiplying.\n\n5/20 = 0.25, 8/20 = 0.4, 7/20 = 0.35.\n\nThen, 0.25 * 50 = 12.5\n\n0.4 * 30 = 12\n\n0.35 * 40 = 14\n\n12.5 + 12 + 14 = 38.5\n\nSame result. So, I'm pretty confident the expected value is $38.50.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. The logic seems sound: calculate each probability, multiply by bonus, add them up.\n\nSo, the expected value is $38.50.\n</think>\n\nThe expected value is calculated by multiplying each department's bonus by the probability of selecting an employee from that department and summing the results.\n\nMarketing: (5/20) * 50 = 12.5  \nDevelopment: (8/20) * 30 = 12  \nCustomer Service: (7/20) * 40 = 14  \n\nTotal Expected Value = 12.5 + 12 + 14 = 38.5\n\nThe expected value of the bonus is $38.50.\n\nDONE."

If selected from Development, they receive a $30 bonus. If selected from Customer Service, they receive a $40 bonus. What is the expected value of the bonus that will be given to the randomly selected employee? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out the expected value of the bonus for this company. Let me break it down step by step. \n\nFirst, I know that the company has three departments: Marketing, Development, and Customer Service. Each department has a different number of employees and a different bonus amount if an employee is selected from that department. The selection is random, so each employee has an equal chance of being chosen. \n\nLet me list out the information:\n\n- **Marketing Department**: 5 employees, bonus is $50.\n- **Development Department**: 8 employees, bonus is $30.\n- **Customer Service Department**: 7 employees, bonus is $40.\n\nHmm, okay. So, to find the expected value, I think I need to calculate the probability of selecting an employee from each department and then multiply each probability by the corresponding bonus. After that, I'll add up all those values to get the expected bonus.\n\nBut wait, how do I calculate the probability for each department? Since the selection is random, the probability of selecting an employee from a particular department is equal to the number of employees in that department divided by the total number of employees in the company.\n\nLet me write that down. The total number of employees is 5 + 8 + 7, which is 20. So, there are 20 employees in total.\n\nNow, the probability of selecting an employee from Marketing is 5/20, which simplifies to 1/4 or 0.25. Similarly, for Development, it's 8/20, which is 2/5 or 0.4. And for Customer Service, it's 7/20, which is 0.35.\n\nOkay, so now I have the probabilities. Next, I'll multiply each probability by the bonus amount for that department.\n\nStarting with Marketing: 0.25 * $50. Let me calculate that. 0.25 times 50 is 12.5.\n\nThen, Development: 0.4 * $30. Hmm, 0.4 times 30 is 12.\n\nLastly, Customer Service: 0.35 * $40. Let me see, 0.35 times 40 is 14.\n\nNow, I need to add these three results together to find the expected value. So, 12.5 + 12 + 14. Let me add 12.5 and 12 first. That gives me 24.5. Then, adding 14 to that, I get 38.5.\n\nSo, the expected value of the bonus is $38.50.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. \n\nTotal employees: 5 + 8 + 7 = 20. Correct.\n\nProbability Marketing: 5/20 = 0.25. Correct.\n\nProbability Development: 8/20 = 0.4. Correct.\n\nProbability Customer Service: 7/20 = 0.35. Correct.\n\nBonuses: $50, $30, $40. Correct.\n\nCalculations:\n\n0.25 * 50 = 12.5. Correct.\n\n0.4 * 30 = 12. Correct.\n\n0.35 * 40 = 14. Correct.\n\nAdding them: 12.5 + 12 = 24.5; 24.5 + 14 = 38.5. Correct.\n\nSo, I think my calculations are accurate. Therefore, the expected value is $38.50.\n</think>\n\nThe expected value is calculated by multiplying each department's probability of selection by its respective bonus and summing the results.\n\n- Probability of selecting Marketing: 5/20 = 0.25, bonus = $50 \u2192 0.25 * 50 = $12.50\n- Probability of selecting Development: 8/20 = 0.40, bonus = $30 \u2192 0.40 * 30 = $12.00\n- Probability of selecting Customer Service: 7/20 = 0.35, bonus = $40 \u2192 0.35 * 40 = $14.00\n\nTotal expected value = $12.50 + $12.00 + $14.00 = $38.50\n\nDONE."
