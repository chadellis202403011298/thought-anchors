The question is asking how many students enjoy reading both fiction and non-fiction. Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, let me list out the given information:\n\n- Total number of students surveyed: 120\n- Students who enjoy reading fiction: 75\n- Students who enjoy reading non-fiction: 55\n- Students who do not enjoy reading at all: 20\n\nI need to find the number of students who enjoy both fiction and non-fiction. Hmm, this sounds like a problem where I can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion in set theory. I remember that the formula for the union of two sets is:\n\nTotal = Number who enjoy Fiction + Number who enjoy Non-Fiction - Number who enjoy both + Number who do not enjoy reading.\n\nWait, let me make sure I have that right. The union of Fiction and Non-Fiction should include all students who enjoy either, plus those who enjoy both, minus those who don't enjoy reading at all. Hmm, maybe I should write it down more formally.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- F = set of students who enjoy fiction\n- N = set of students who enjoy non-fiction\n- B = set of students who enjoy both\n- U = total number of students surveyed (120)\n- U' = students who do not enjoy reading at all (20)\n\nThe formula for the union of F and N is:\n\n|F \u222a N| = |F| + |N| - |F \u2229 N|\n\nBut |F \u222a N| is also equal to the total number of students who enjoy reading, which is U - U'. So:\n\nU - U' = |F| + |N| - |F \u2229 N|\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n120 - 20 = 75 + 55 - |F \u2229 N|\n\nSo, 100 = 130 - |F \u2229 N|\n\nTherefore, |F \u2229 N| = 130 - 100 = 30\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. So, 30 students enjoy both fiction and non-fiction. Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n1. Total students: 120\n2. Students who don't read: 20\n3. So, students who read something = 120 - 20 = 100\n4. Students who enjoy fiction: 75\n5. Students who enjoy non-fiction: 55\n6. Using inclusion-exclusion: 75 + 55 - Both = 100\n7. So, Both = 75 + 55 - 100 = 30\n\nYes, that checks out. So, the number of students who enjoy both is 30.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many students enjoy both fiction and non-fiction, we use the inclusion-exclusion principle.\n\nGiven:\n- Total students (U) = 120\n- Students who don't enjoy reading (U') = 20\n- Students who enjoy fiction (F) = 75\n- Students who enjoy non-fiction (N) = 55\n\nFirst, calculate the number of students who enjoy reading:\nStudents who enjoy reading = U - U' = 120 - 20 = 100\n\nUsing the inclusion-exclusion principle:\n|F \u222a N| = |F| + |N| - |F \u2229 N|\n100 = 75 + 55 - |F \u2229 N|\n\nSolving for |F \u2229 N|:\n100 = 130 - |F \u2229 N|\n|F \u2229 N| = 130 - 100 = 30\n\n**DONE.**"

The data given is that 75 students enjoy reading fiction, 55 enjoy reading non-fiction, and 20 don't enjoy reading at all. The question is asking how many students enjoy reading both fiction and non-fiction.\n\nHmm, okay, so I think this is a problem related to sets and maybe using a Venn diagram to visualize it. I remember something about the principle of inclusion-exclusion from my math classes. Let me try to recall how that works.\n\nSo, if I have two groups, Group A and Group B, the total number of students in either Group A or Group B can be found by adding the number in Group A and the number in Group B, but then subtracting those who are in both groups to avoid double-counting. The formula is:\n\nTotal = |A| + |B| - |A \u2229 B|\n\nIn this problem, Group A could be the students who enjoy reading fiction, and Group B those who enjoy reading non-fiction. The total number of students surveyed is 120. Out of these, 20 don't enjoy reading at all, so that means 120 - 20 = 100 students enjoy reading at least one of the two genres.\n\nSo, applying the inclusion-exclusion principle:\n\n100 = 75 (fiction) + 55 (non-fiction) - Both\n\nI need to find the number of students who enjoy both, which is |A \u2229 B|. Let me set that equal to x.\n\nSo, 100 = 75 + 55 - x\n\nCalculating 75 + 55 gives me 130. So,\n\n100 = 130 - x\n\nTo solve for x, I can rearrange the equation:\n\nx = 130 - 100\n\nx = 30\n\nSo, 30 students enjoy reading both fiction and non-fiction.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. If 30 students enjoy both, then the number who enjoy only fiction would be 75 - 30 = 45, and those who enjoy only non-fiction would be 55 - 30 = 25. Adding those up: 45 (only fiction) + 25 (only non-fiction) + 30 (both) = 100, which matches the number of students who enjoy reading. And adding the 20 who don't enjoy reading gives the total of 120 students surveyed. That makes sense.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the number of students who enjoy both is 30.\n</think>\n\nThe number of students who enjoy reading both fiction and non-fiction is found using the inclusion-exclusion principle. \n\nTotal students who enjoy reading: 120 - 20 = 100.\n\nLet x be the number of students who enjoy both. Then:\n\n75 (fiction) + 55 (non-fiction) - x = 100\n\nSolving for x:\n\n130 - x = 100  \nx = 30\n\nDONE."

Adding these together gives 130 students. However, there are only 120 students in total. This means that 10 students are counted twice when I added the two groups. Therefore, these 10 students must enjoy both fiction and non-fiction.\n\nThus, the number of students who enjoy reading both fiction and non-fiction is 10.\nDONE.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many students enjoy both **fiction** and **non-fiction**, we'll use the **Inclusion-Exclusion Principle**.\n\n**Given:**\n- Total students surveyed, \\( T = 120 \\)\n- Students who enjoy reading fiction, \\( F = 75 \\)\n- Students who enjoy reading non-fiction, \\( N = 55 \\)\n- Students who do not enjoy reading at all, \\( D = 20 \\)\n\n**Step 1: Apply the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle**\n\nThe number of students who enjoy **either** fiction **or** non-fiction is calculated by:\n\\[\nE = F + N - B\n\\]\nwhere:\n- \\( E \\) = Number of students who enjoy either fiction or non-fiction\n- \\( B \\) = Number of students who enjoy both fiction and non-fiction\n\n**Step 2: Find the Number of Students Who Enjoy Either Genre**\n\nFirst, calculate the number of students who enjoy **either** fiction **or** non-fiction:\n\\[\nE = F + N - B\n\\]\nBut we know that:\n\\[\nE + D = T\n\\]\n\\[\nE + 20 = 120\n\\]\n\\[\nE = 120 - 20 = 100\n\\]\n\nSo, \\( E = 100 \\).\n\n**Step 3: Solve for the Number of Students Who Enjoy Both Genres**\n\nUsing the Inclusion-Exclusion formula:\n\\[\n100 = 75 + 55 - B\n\\]\n\\[\n100 = 130 - B\n\\]\n\\[\nB = 130 - 100\n\\]\n\\[\nB = 30\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{30}\n\\]\n\n**DONE.**"

Hmm, okay. I think this is a problem about sets and maybe using a Venn diagram or something like that. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the total number of students surveyed is 120. Out of these, 20 don't enjoy reading at all. So, that leaves us with 120 - 20 = 100 students who enjoy reading, either fiction, non-fiction, or both. Got it.\n\nSo, we have 100 students who like reading, and they can be split into two groups: those who like fiction and those who like non-fiction. But some students might like both. So, the total number of students who like fiction or non-fiction is 75 + 55. But wait, that counts the ones who like both twice, right? Because if I just add 75 and 55, I'm counting the overlap twice.\n\nSo, to find the actual number of students who like at least one of the two, I should subtract the overlap once. That is, total = number who like fiction + number who like non-fiction - number who like both. So, in formula terms:\n\nTotal who like reading = (Fiction + Non-Fiction) - Both\n\nWe know the total who like reading is 100. So,\n\n100 = 75 + 55 - Both\n\nLet me do the math here. 75 plus 55 is 130. So,\n\n100 = 130 - Both\n\nTo find Both, I can rearrange the equation:\n\nBoth = 130 - 100 = 30\n\nSo, 30 students enjoy reading both fiction and non-fiction.\n\nWait, does that make sense? Let me double-check. If 75 like fiction and 55 like non-fiction, and 20 don't like either, then the total number of students is 120. The students who like at least one are 100. So, using the formula for union of two sets:\n\n|F \u222a N| = |F| + |N| - |F \u2229 N|\n\nWhich is exactly what I did. So, 100 = 75 + 55 - |F \u2229 N|, leading to |F \u2229 N| = 30. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nI think I've got it. So, the number of students who enjoy both is 30.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of students who enjoy both fiction and non-fiction, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. \n\nTotal students surveyed = 120  \nStudents who do not enjoy reading = 20  \nStudents who enjoy reading = 120 - 20 = 100  \n\nNumber of students who enjoy reading fiction = 75  \nNumber of students who enjoy reading non-fiction = 55  \n\nUsing the inclusion-exclusion principle:  \nNumber who enjoy reading (either fiction or non-fiction or both) = Number who enjoy fiction + Number who enjoy non-fiction - Number who enjoy both.  \n\nLet x be the number of students who enjoy both.  \nSo, 100 = 75 + 55 - x  \n100 = 130 - x  \nx = 130 - 100  \nx = 30  \n\nDONE."

The question is asking how many students enjoy reading both fiction and non-fiction. Hmm, okay. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me list out the given information:\n\n- Total number of students surveyed: 120\n- Students who enjoy reading fiction: 75\n- Students who enjoy reading non-fiction: 55\n- Students who do not enjoy reading at all: 20\n\nI need to find out how many students enjoy both fiction and non-fiction. Hmm, this seems like a problem where I can use set theory or maybe a Venn diagram. I remember something about the principle of inclusion-exclusion from my math class. Let me recall that.\n\nThe inclusion-exclusion principle for two sets says that the total number of elements in both sets is equal to the sum of the elements in each set minus the number of elements that are in both sets. In mathematical terms, that would be:\n\nTotal = Fiction + Non-Fiction - Both\n\nWait, but in this case, the \"Total\" isn't the entire surveyed group because some students don't enjoy reading at all. So, I think I need to adjust for that. Let me think. The students who don't enjoy reading are separate from those who enjoy either fiction or non-fiction.\n\nSo, maybe I should first find out how many students enjoy reading at least one of the two genres. That would be the total number of students who enjoy fiction plus those who enjoy non-fiction, minus those who enjoy both (which is what we're trying to find). But then, since 20 students don't enjoy reading at all, the number of students who enjoy at least one genre would be the total surveyed minus those 20.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nNumber of students who enjoy reading = Total surveyed - Students who don't enjoy reading\nNumber of students who enjoy reading = 120 - 20 = 100\n\nOkay, so 100 students enjoy reading at least one of the genres. Now, according to the inclusion-exclusion principle:\n\nNumber of students who enjoy reading = Number who enjoy fiction + Number who enjoy non-fiction - Number who enjoy both\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n100 = 75 + 55 - Both\n\nLet me compute 75 plus 55 first. That's 130. So,\n\n100 = 130 - Both\n\nTo find the number who enjoy both, I can rearrange the equation:\n\nBoth = 130 - 100 = 30\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. So, 30 students enjoy both fiction and non-fiction. Let me just double-check my reasoning to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, I accounted for the 20 students who don't read at all by subtracting them from the total to find the number of students who enjoy reading. That gave me 100 students. Then, using the inclusion-exclusion principle, I added the number of students who enjoy fiction and non-fiction, which were 75 and 55, respectively, to find the total number of students in both sets. But since 100 students are the total who enjoy reading, the overlap (those who enjoy both) must be the difference between 130 and 100, which is 30.\n\nLet me think if there's another way to approach this, maybe using a Venn diagram. If I draw two overlapping circles, one for fiction and one for non-fiction, the total number in either circle would be 100, as we found earlier. The total number in both circles combined is 75 + 55 = 130, so the overlapping part would be 130 - 100 = 30. Yeah, that matches my earlier result.\n\nSo, I think 30 is the correct number of students who enjoy both fiction and non-fiction.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many students enjoy both fiction and non-fiction, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. First, calculate the number of students who enjoy reading by subtracting those who don't enjoy reading from the total surveyed.\n\nNumber of students who enjoy reading = 120 - 20 = 100\n\nUsing the inclusion-exclusion principle:\n\nNumber of students who enjoy reading = Number who enjoy fiction + Number who enjoy non-fiction - Number who enjoy both\n\n100 = 75 + 55 - Both\n\nSolving for Both:\n\nBoth = 75 + 55 - 100 = 30\n\nDONE."

End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: In a survey of 120 college students, the following information was collected:\n- 75 students enjoy reading fiction\n- 55 students enjoy reading non-fiction\n- 20 students do not enjoy reading at all\n\nBased on this information, how many students enjoy reading both fiction and non-fiction? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this problem here about a survey of 120 college students. The question is asking how many students enjoy reading both fiction and non-fiction. Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, let's list out the information given:\n\n- Total number of students surveyed: 120\n- Students who enjoy reading fiction: 75\n- Students who enjoy reading non-fiction: 55\n- Students who do not enjoy reading at all: 20\n\nHmm, okay. So, out of 120 students, 20 don't enjoy reading. That means the remaining students must enjoy reading, but we don't know if they enjoy fiction, non-fiction, or both. Let me calculate how many students do enjoy reading.\n\nTotal students who enjoy reading = Total students surveyed - Students who do not enjoy reading\nSo, that's 120 - 20 = 100 students enjoy reading in some form.\n\nNow, out of these 100 students, some enjoy fiction, some enjoy non-fiction, and some might enjoy both. The question is asking for the overlap, the number who enjoy both.\n\nI remember this is a problem about sets, specifically about the intersection of two sets. The formula for the union of two sets is:\n\nNumber who enjoy fiction + Number who enjoy non-fiction - Number who enjoy both = Total number who enjoy reading\n\nIn mathematical terms:\n\nF + N - B = T\n\nWhere:\n- F is the number who enjoy fiction (75)\n- N is the number who enjoy non-fiction (55)\n- B is the number who enjoy both (what we're looking for)\n- T is the total number who enjoy reading (100)\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n75 + 55 - B = 100\n\nAdding 75 and 55 gives me 130.\n\nSo:\n\n130 - B = 100\n\nTo find B, I subtract 100 from both sides:\n\n130 - 100 = B\n30 = B\n\nSo, 30 students enjoy both fiction and non-fiction.\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nIf 30 students enjoy both, then the number who enjoy only fiction would be 75 - 30 = 45, and the number who enjoy only non-fiction would be 55 - 30 = 25. Adding those up: 45 (only fiction) + 25 (only non-fiction) + 30 (both) = 100, which matches the total number of students who enjoy reading. And adding the 20 who don't read, we get 120, which is the total number surveyed.\n\nEverything seems to add up correctly. So, I'm confident that 30 is the right answer.\n</think>\n\nTo find the number of students who enjoy both fiction and non-fiction, we use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. \n\n1. **Total students surveyed**: 120\n2. **Students who do not enjoy reading**: 20\n3. **Students who enjoy reading (either fiction or non-fiction or both)**: 120 - 20 = 100\n4. **Students who enjoy reading fiction**: 75\n5. **Students who enjoy reading non-fiction**: 55\n\nUsing the formula:\n\\[ \\text{Fiction} + \\text{Non-Fiction} - \\text{Both} = \\text{Total Reading} \\]\n\\[ 75 + 55 - \\text{Both} = 100 \\]\n\\[ 130 - \\text{Both} = 100 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Both} = 130 - 100 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Both} = 30 \\]\n\nDONE."
