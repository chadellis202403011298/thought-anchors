  "question": "In a survey of 120 college students, the following information was collected:\n- 75 students enjoy reading fiction\n- 55 students enjoy reading non-fiction\n- 20 students do not enjoy reading at all\n\nBased on this information, how many students enjoy reading both fiction and non-fiction?",
  "answer": "Let's set up the problem using a Venn diagram approach:\n\nStep 1: Identify what we know.\n- Total number of students: 120\n- Students who enjoy fiction: 75\n- Students who enjoy non-fiction: 55\n- Students who don't enjoy reading at all: 20\n\nStep 2: Calculate how many students enjoy at least one type of reading.\nStudents who enjoy at least one type = Total - Students who don't enjoy reading\n= 120 - 20 = 100 students\n\nStep 3: Let's use variable x to represent the number of students who enjoy both fiction and non-fiction.\n\nStep 4: Create equations based on the Venn diagram:\n- Students who enjoy fiction only = 75 - x\n- Students who enjoy non-fiction only = 55 - x\n\nStep 5: The sum of these two groups plus the overlap should equal the total number of students who enjoy at least one type of reading:\n(75 - x) + (55 - x) + x = 100\n\nStep 6: Solve for x.\n75 - x + 55 - x + x = 100\n130 - x = 100\nx = 30\n\nTherefore, 30 students enjoy reading both fiction and non-fiction."
