  "question": "A teacher makes the following statement to her class: 'If you get an A on the final exam, then you will pass the course.' Which of the following situations would prove that the teacher's statement is false?\n\nA) A student gets an A on the final exam and passes the course.\nB) A student gets an A on the final exam and fails the course.\nC) A student does not get an A on the final exam and passes the course.\nD) A student does not get an A on the final exam and fails the course.",
  "answer": "The correct answer is B.\n\nTo analyze this problem, we need to understand the logical structure of conditional statements. The teacher's statement has the form 'If P, then Q', where:\nP = 'you get an A on the final exam'\nQ = 'you will pass the course'\n\nA conditional statement 'If P, then Q' is false only when P is true and Q is false. In other words, the only way to prove the teacher's statement false is to find a case where a student gets an A on the final exam (P is true) but fails the course (Q is false).\n\nLet's examine each option:\n\nA) A student gets an A (P is true) and passes the course (Q is true). This satisfies the conditional statement, so it doesn't prove the statement false.\n\nB) A student gets an A (P is true) and fails the course (Q is false). This contradicts the conditional statement, so it proves the statement false.\n\nC) A student does not get an A (P is false) and passes the course (Q is true). When the antecedent (P) is false, the conditional statement is automatically true regardless of the consequent (Q). This doesn't prove the statement false.\n\nD) A student does not get an A (P is false) and fails the course (Q is false). When the antecedent (P) is false, the conditional statement is automatically true regardless of the consequent (Q). This doesn't prove the statement false.\n\nTherefore, B is the only situation that would prove the teacher's statement false."
