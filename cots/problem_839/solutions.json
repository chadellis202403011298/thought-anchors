End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: A teacher makes the following statement to her class: 'If you get an A on the final exam, then you will pass the course.' Which of the following situations would prove that the teacher's statement is false?\n\nA) A student gets an A on the final exam and passes the course.\nB) A student gets an A on the final exam and fails the course.\nC) A student does not get an A on the final exam and passes the course.\nD) A student does not get an A on the final exam and fails the course. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I've got this logic problem here, and I need to figure out which situation would prove that the teacher's statement is false. The teacher said, \"If you get an A on the final exam, then you will pass the course.\" Hmm, okay, so it's a conditional statement. In logic terms, that would be \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"getting an A on the final exam\" and Q is \"passing the course.\"\n\nNow, the question is asking which situation would make the teacher's statement false. I remember that in logic, a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is only false when P is true and Q is false. So, to disprove the teacher's statement, we need a case where a student gets an A (P is true) but doesn't pass the course (Q is false). \n\nLet me look at the options again:\n\nA) A student gets an A and passes the course. Well, if P is true and Q is true, that's actually supporting the teacher's statement, right? It doesn't disprove it. So A isn't the one.\n\nB) A student gets an A and fails the course. Okay, here P is true and Q is false. That fits the condition where the conditional statement is false. So B seems like a candidate.\n\nC) A student doesn't get an A and passes the course. Here, P is false, and Q is true. But wait, the conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is true in this case because the statement only makes a claim when P is true. If P is false, the statement doesn't say anything about Q. So this doesn't disprove the teacher's statement. It might even support it indirectly because not getting an A doesn't necessarily mean you'll fail.\n\nD) A student doesn't get an A and fails the course. So P is false and Q is false. Again, since the statement only talks about what happens when you get an A, this doesn't directly disprove it. It's possible that not getting an A could lead to failing, but that's not the same as disproving the conditional statement.\n\nSo, after thinking through each option, it looks like option B is the one that directly contradicts the teacher's statement by showing that getting an A doesn't guarantee passing. Therefore, the teacher's statement is false in this situation.\n</think>\n\nThe situation that disproves the teacher's statement is when a student gets an A on the final exam but fails the course.\n\nB) A student gets an A on the final exam and fails the course.\n\nDONE."

Because in logic, the only way a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is false is when P is true and Q is false.\n\nSo, the statement is P \u2192 Q. The negation of that would be \u00acP \u2228 Q. But to find a counterexample, we need P to be true and Q to be false. That makes sense because if you have P true and Q false, it directly contradicts the original statement.\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA) A student gets an A and passes. So P is true and Q is true. That actually supports the teacher's statement, so this doesn't disprove it.\n\nB) A student gets an A and fails. Here, P is true, but Q is false. This directly contradicts the teacher's statement because it shows that getting an A doesn't guarantee passing.\n\nC) A student doesn't get an A and passes. So \u00acP is true, and Q is true. This doesn't affect the original statement because the statement only talks about what happens if you get an A. Not getting an A doesn't say anything about passing or failing.\n\nD) A student doesn't get an A and fails. So \u00acP is true, and \u00acQ is true. This also doesn't disprove the teacher's statement because the statement only talks about the consequence of getting an A, not about what happens if you don't get one.\n\nSo, the only situation that directly contradicts the teacher's statement is option B.

The teacher said, \"If you get an A on the final exam, then you will pass the course.\" Hmm, that sounds like a conditional statement. In logic, that's like saying if P then Q, where P is getting an A and Q is passing the course.\n\nAlright, so to disprove this statement, I need to find a situation where P is true but Q is false. Because in logic, the only way the statement \"If P, then Q\" is false is when P is true and Q is false. That's called a counterexample.\n\nLet me go through each option one by one.\n\nOption A: A student gets an A and passes. Well, that fits the teacher's statement. If you get an A, you pass. So this doesn't disprove it; it actually supports the statement.\n\nOption B: A student gets an A and fails. Wait, that seems contradictory. If you get an A, according to the teacher, you should pass. But here, the student got an A and failed. That directly contradicts the teacher's statement. So this would be a counterexample, proving the teacher's statement is false.\n\nOption C: A student doesn't get an A and passes. The teacher didn't say anything about what happens if you don't get an A. She only made a promise about getting an A leading to passing. So this doesn't affect the truth of her statement. It's possible to pass without an A, but that's allowed in the teacher's statement.\n\nOption D: A student doesn't get an A and fails. Again, the teacher's statement doesn't cover this scenario.

Let me read it again and try to understand what it's asking.\n\nThe teacher says, \"If you get an A on the final exam, then you will pass the course.\" So, in logical terms, that's like saying: If A, then B. Where A is \"getting an A on the final exam\" and B is \"passing the course.\"\n\nNow, the question is asking which situation would prove that this statement is false. The options are A, B, C, D, each describing a different scenario.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some basic logic principles. I remember that for a conditional statement \"If A, then B,\" the only way it can be false is if A is true and B is false. That's known as a contradiction. So, in this case, the statement \"If you get an A, then you pass\" would only be false if someone gets an A but doesn't pass.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA) A student gets an A and passes. Well, that fits the conditional statement. If A, then B. So, this actually supports the teacher's statement, not disproves it. So, A is not the answer.\n\nB) A student gets an A and fails. This seems to directly contradict the teacher's statement. If someone gets an A but doesn't pass, that violates the \"If A, then B\" structure. So, B looks like a possible answer.\n\nC) A student doesn't get an A and passes. This is a case where the condition is false, but the outcome is true. In logic, a false condition can lead to either a true or false conclusion. Since the statement only specifies what happens if A is true, this doesn't violate the teacher's statement. So, C doesn't disprove it.\n\nD) A student doesn't get an A and fails. This is another case where the condition is false. Similar to C, it doesn't directly affect the conditional statement because the statement only talks about what happens if A is true. So, D doesn't disprove the teacher's statement either.\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The key here is that the teacher's statement is a conditional, and conditionals are only false when the antecedent is true and the consequent is false. So, any situation where the student doesn't get an A doesn't affect the truth of the statement because the statement doesn't make any claims about what happens when they don't get an A.\n\nSo, the only scenario that would make the teacher's statement false is when the student gets an A but fails the course, which is option B.\n\nI think that's solid. No other options would disprove the statement because they either align with it or don't affect it.\n</think>\n\nThe teacher's statement is \"If you get an A, then you will pass.\" For this to be false, the student must have gotten an A but failed. \n\nAnswer: B) A student gets an A on the final exam and fails the course.\n\nDONE."

Let me denote it as:\n\nIf P, then Q.\n\nWhere:\n- P is \"you get an A on the final exam.\"\n- Q is \"you will pass the course.\"\n\nSo, the statement is P \u2192 Q.\n\nNow, the question is asking which situation would prove that this statement is false. In logic, a conditional statement P \u2192 Q is only false when P is true, and Q is false. So, for the teacher's statement to be false, we need a situation where a student got an A on the final exam (P is true) but did not pass the course (Q is false).\n\nLet me look at the options one by one.\n\nOption A: A student gets an A on the final exam and passes the course.\n\nSo, P is true, and Q is true. But according to the conditional statement, if P is true, Q must also be true. So, this actually supports the teacher's statement, not contradicts it. Therefore, this doesn't prove the statement is false.\n\nOption B: A student gets an A on the final exam and fails the course.\n\nHere, P is true, and Q is false. That's exactly the scenario where the conditional statement P \u2192 Q would be false. So, this situation would indeed prove that the teacher's statement is false.\n\nOption C: A student does not get an A on the final exam and passes the course.\n\nIn this case, P is false, and Q is true. Now, in logic, a conditional statement P \u2192 Q is true when P is false, regardless of Q. So, this situation doesn't affect the truth value of the teacher's statement. It could happen and still be consistent with the teacher's statement.\n\nOption D: A student does not get an A on the final exam and fails the course.\n\nHere, P is false, and Q is false. Again, since P is false, the conditional statement P \u2192 Q is automatically true. So, this doesn't contradict the teacher's statement either.\n\nPutting it all together, the only situation that directly contradicts the teacher's statement and proves it's false is Option B, where a student gets an A but fails the course.\n</think>\n\nThe situation that would prove the teacher's statement false is when a student gets an A on the final exam but fails the course.\n\n**Answer:** B) A student gets an A on the final exam and fails the course.\n\nDONE."

The teacher says, \"If you get an A on the final exam, then you will pass the course.\" And I need to figure out which of the four options would prove that this statement is false. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that in logic, statements like \"If P, then Q\" can be represented as P \u2192 Q. The teacher's statement is P \u2192 Q, where P is \"getting an A on the final exam\" and Q is \"passing the course.\" So, the teacher is saying that P implies Q.\n\nNow, to disprove a statement like P \u2192 Q, I need to find a situation where P is true, but Q is false. Because in logic, the only way for P \u2192 Q to be false is when P is true and Q is false. So, if I can find a case where a student got an A but didn't pass the course, that would make the teacher's statement false.\n\nLet me look at the options one by one.\n\nOption A: A student gets an A on the final exam and passes the course. So, P is true and Q is true. In logic, when both P and Q are true, P \u2192 Q is true. So this doesn't disprove the teacher's statement. It actually supports it.\n\nOption B: A student gets an A on the final exam and fails the course. Here, P is true, and Q is false. This is exactly the scenario where P \u2192 Q is false. So this situation would disprove the teacher's statement because it shows that getting an A doesn't guarantee passing.\n\nOption C: A student does not get an A on the final exam and passes the course. Here, P is false, and Q is true. In logic, when P is false, P \u2192 Q is automatically true regardless of Q. So this doesn't affect the truth of the teacher's statement. It's a true statement, but it doesn't disprove anything.\n\nOption D: A student does not get an A on the final exam and fails the course. Here, P is false, and Q is false. Again, since P is false, P \u2192 Q is true. So this doesn't disprove the teacher's statement either.\n\nSo, after evaluating each option, Option B is the one that provides a counterexample to the teacher's statement. It shows that getting an A doesn't necessarily mean passing the course, which directly contradicts the teacher's implication.\n</think>\n\nThe teacher's statement is \"If you get an A on the final exam, then you will pass the course.\" To disprove this, we need a situation where a student got an A but failed the course. \n\n**Option B:** A student gets an A on the final exam and fails the course.

This fits the condition where P is true, and Q is false, which makes P \u2192 Q false. So, this situation would indeed disprove the teacher's statement.\n\nOption C: A student does not get an A on the final exam and passes the course.\n\nHere, P is false (they didn't get an A), and Q is true (they passed).

But I should check the other options to be sure.\n\nOption C: A student does not get an A on the final exam and passes the course. Here, P is false (no A) and Q is true (passing). Since the conditional statement is only concerned with cases where P is true, this doesn't affect the truth value of the statement.

This directly contradicts the conditional statement because it shows that getting an A doesn't guarantee passing. This would make the teacher's statement false. So, this looks like a candidate.\n\nOption C: A student does not get an A on the final exam and passes the course. Here, P is false (not A), and Q is true (pass). In logic, a conditional statement is true whenever P is false, regardless of Q. So, this doesn't affect the truth of the teacher's statement.\n\nOption D: A student does not get an A on the final exam and fails the course. Here, P is false (not A), and Q is false (fail). Again, when P is false, the conditional statement is considered true, regardless of Q. So, this also doesn't disprove the teacher's statement.\n\nSo, after analyzing all options, only Option B provides a scenario where the teacher's statement is false. Therefore, the correct answer should be B.\n</think>\n\nThe teacher's statement is a conditional: If A, then Pass. For this to be false, A must be true, and not Pass. Only situation B fits this condition.\n\n**Answer: B**\n\nDONE."
