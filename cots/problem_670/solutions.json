End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: You have three identical cubes, each with a different pattern on each face: stars, circles, triangles, squares, hearts, and crosses. The cubes are placed in a row on a table. Looking at the front faces of the three cubes from left to right, you see: star, circle, triangle. Looking at the top faces from left to right, you see: heart, square, cross. Looking at the right side of the rightmost cube, you see a circle. What pattern appears on the left side of the leftmost cube? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nTo determine the left face of the leftmost cube, I need to analyze the information provided about the three cubes and their patterns.\n\nFirst, I'll list out the visible patterns on each cube based on the descriptions:\n\n- **Leftmost Cube**\n  - Front: Star\n  - Top: Heart\n\n- **Middle Cube**\n  - Front: Circle\n  - Top: Square\n\n- **Rightmost Cube**\n  - Front: Triangle\n  - Top: Cross\n  - Right Side: Circle\n\nSince the cubes are identical, each cube has six faces with distinct patterns: stars, circles, triangles, squares, hearts, and crosses.\n\nThe key is to consider the orientation of each cube. Each cube can be rotated such that a specific face is on the front, another on the top, and another on the right side. This means that the front, top, and right faces are all different for each cube.\n\nGiven that the rightmost cube has a circle on its right side, this implies that the circle is not on the front or top face of that cube. Therefore, the circle must be on the right face, and the front and top faces must be the remaining patterns: star, triangle, heart, square, and cross.\n\nHowever, the leftmost cube has a star on its front face and a heart on its top face. Since each cube must have all six patterns, the leftmost cube cannot have a star or heart on any other face, including the right face.\n\nSimilarly, the middle cube has a circle on its front face and a square on its top face. Therefore, the middle cube cannot have a circle or square on any other face, including the right face.\n\nNow, let's determine the possible patterns for the right face of the leftmost cube. The leftmost cube already has a star on the front and a heart on the top, so the remaining patterns are circles, triangles, squares, and crosses.\n\nThe rightmost cube has a circle on its right face, so the leftmost cube cannot have a circle on its right face. Therefore, the right face of the leftmost cube must be either a triangle, square, or cross.\n\nTo find the specific pattern, I need to consider the orientation of the leftmost cube. Since the front face is a star and the top face is a heart, the right face must be one of the remaining patterns that isn't on the front or top of the rightmost cube.\n\nThe rightmost cube has a triangle on its front face, so the leftmost cube cannot have a triangle on its right face. Similarly, the rightmost cube has a cross on its top face, so the leftmost cube cannot have a cross on its right face.\n\nThis leaves only the square as a possible pattern for the right face of the leftmost cube.\n\nTherefore, the left face of the leftmost cube must be the remaining pattern, which is the cross.\n</think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\nLet's analyze the problem step by step to determine the pattern on the left face of the leftmost cube.\n\n1. **Identify the Patterns on Each Cube:**\n   - **Leftmost Cube:**\n     - Front face: Star\n     - Top face: Heart\n   - **Middle Cube:**\n     - Front face: Circle\n     - Top face: Square\n   - **Rightmost Cube:**\n     - Front face: Triangle\n     - Top face: Cross\n     - Right face: Circle\n\n2. **Understand the Cube's Faces:**\n   Each cube has six distinct patterns: **stars, circles, triangles, squares, hearts, and crosses**. Since the cubes are identical, each pattern appears exactly once on each cube.\n\n3. **Determine the Left Face of the Leftmost Cube:**\n   - The leftmost cube has a **star** on its front face and a **heart** on its top face.\n   - Therefore, the remaining patterns on the leftmost cube are **circles, triangles, squares, and crosses**.\n   - The rightmost cube has a **circle** on its right face, so the leftmost cube cannot have a **circle** on its right face.\n   - Similarly, the rightmost cube has a **cross** on its top face, so the leftmost cube cannot have a **cross** on its right face.\n   - This leaves the **square** as the only possible pattern for the right face of the leftmost cube.\n   - Consequently, the left face of the leftmost cube must be the **remaining pattern**, which is the **cross**.\n\n**Answer:** The left face of the leftmost cube has a **cross**.\n\nDONE."

The cubes are placed in a row on a table. Looking at the front faces of the three cubes from left to right, you see: star, circle, triangle. Looking at the top faces from left to right, you see: heart, square, cross. Looking at the right side of the rightmost cube, you see a circle. What pattern appears on the left side of the leftmost cube? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this problem with three identical cubes, each with different patterns on their faces: stars, circles, triangles, squares, hearts, and crosses. They're placed in a row on a table. The front faces, from left to right, show a star, circle, and triangle. The top faces, also from left to right, show a heart, square, and cross. Additionally, on the right side of the rightmost cube, there's a circle. I need to figure out what pattern is on the left side of the leftmost cube.\n\nFirst, I need to visualize the cubes and their orientations. Each cube has six faces, and each face has a unique pattern. Since the cubes are identical, their shapes are the same, but the patterns differ.\n\nLet me start by labeling the cubes for clarity. I'll call them Cube A (leftmost), Cube B (middle), and Cube C (rightmost). \n\nFrom the front view, Cube A's front face is a star, Cube B's front face is a circle, and Cube C's front face is a triangle. So, front faces: Star (A), Circle (B), Triangle (C).\n\nFrom the top view, Cube A's top face is a heart, Cube B's top face is a square, and Cube C's top face is a cross. So, top faces: Heart (A), Square (B), Cross (C).\n\nAlso, on the right side of Cube C (the rightmost cube), there's a circle. So, the right face of Cube C is a circle.\n\nWait, but the front face of Cube C is a triangle. So, if I imagine Cube C, its front face is a triangle, and the right face is a circle. That means Cube C is rotated such that when we look at it from the front, we see the triangle, and from the right, we see the circle.\n\nI need to figure out the orientation of each cube to determine what's on the left side of Cube A. Since all cubes are identical, the arrangement of patterns on each cube's faces is fixed, but their orientations can vary.\n\nLet me think about Cube C first because I have more information about it. Cube C's front face is a triangle, and its right face is a circle. So, the triangle is facing me, and the circle is on its right side. That means the triangle is on the front, the circle is on the right, so the other faces can be determined based on that.\n\nSimilarly, Cube B's front face is a circle, and its top face is a square. So, Cube B is oriented such that when viewed from the front, it shows a circle, and from above, it shows a square.\n\nCube A's front face is a star, and its top face is a heart.\n\nI need to figure out what's on the left side of Cube A. The left face of Cube A is opposite its right face. So, if I can determine what's on the right face of Cube A, I can figure out the left face.\n\nBut to do that, I need to know how Cube A is oriented. Let's try to figure out Cube A's orientation.\n\nCube A: Front - Star, Top - Heart. So, it's placed such that the star is facing me, and the heart is on top.\n\nAssuming the cube is placed with the front face as Star, the top face as Heart. So, the cube is oriented with Star front, Heart top, and then we can figure out the other faces.\n\nBut I need to determine the left face, which is opposite the right face. So, if I can figure out the right face of Cube A, I can find the left face.\n\nTo do that, I might need to consider the orientation of the other cubes and how they're placed relative to each other.\n\nWait, the cubes are placed in a row on a table. So, they're all on the same plane, each next to the other. So, their orientations are in 3D space, but all on the table's surface.\n\nSo, each cube has a front, back, left, right, top, and bottom face.\n\nLet me try to reconstruct the orientations.\n\nStarting with Cube C (rightmost). Its front is triangle, right is circle. So, the triangle is front, circle is right. Therefore, the back face is opposite the front, so it's the opposite of triangle, which we don't know yet. Similarly, the left face of Cube C is opposite its right face, so left face is opposite circle. But wait, the left face of Cube C is also adjacent to Cube B's right face. So, Cube B's right face is adjacent to Cube C's left face.\n\nBut Cube B's front is circle, top is square. So, Cube B is oriented such that its front is circle, top is square. Therefore, the right face of Cube B is adjacent to the left face of Cube C.\n\nSo, the right face of Cube B is adjacent to the left face of Cube C. But we don't know what's on those faces yet.\n\nLet me try to map this out.\n\nCube A: front=Star, top=Heart\n\nCube B: front=Circle, top=Square\n\nCube C: front=Triangle, right=Circle (given), top=Cross\n\nSo, Cube C's top is cross, which is the top face, so the bottom face is opposite, which would be the opposite of cross. But we don't know yet.\n\nSimilarly, Cube B's top is square, so its bottom is opposite, which is the opposite of square.\n\nCube A's top is heart, so its bottom is opposite of heart.\n\nNow, considering that the cubes are on a table, the bottom faces are all on the table, so they can't be seen. The top faces are visible from above.\n\nSo, the front, back, left, right, and top/bottom are all relative.\n\nLet me try to figure out the right face of Cube A.\n\nCube A's front is Star, top is Heart. So, the cube is oriented with Star front, Heart top.\n\nAssuming the cube is placed with front as Star, top as Heart, then the right face is adjacent to the top face. So, if the top is Heart, the right face would be to the right of Heart.\n\nWait, but the cube is three-dimensional. So, when you look at the front, you see Star, and the top is Heart, so the right face is adjacent to both the front and the top.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe I should think about the cube's orientation in 3D.\n\nLet me consider Cube A. Front face is Star, so that's fixed. The top face is Heart. So, the Heart is on the top, which is above the front face.\n\nIn a standard cube orientation, front is facing me, top is above, right is to the right, left is to the left, back is behind, bottom is below.\n\nSo, if Cube A is placed with front as Star, top as Heart, then the right face would be to the right of the front face, which is Star. Similarly, the left face would be to the left of Star.\n\nBut I need to figure out what's on the left face of Cube A. So, if I can figure out what's on the right face, I can determine the left face, as left and right are opposites.\n\nBut to do that, I might need to consider Cube B and Cube C's orientations relative to Cube A.\n\nSince the cubes are in a row, each cube's right face is adjacent to the next cube's left face.\n\nSo, Cube A's right face is adjacent to Cube B's left face.\n\nSimilarly, Cube B's right face is adjacent to Cube C's left face.\n\nGiven that, and knowing the front and top faces, I can try to figure out the orientations.\n\nLet me start with Cube C.\n\nCube C: front=Triangle, right=Circle, top=Cross.\n\nSo, front is Triangle, right is Circle, top is Cross.\n\nSo, the cube is oriented such that when you look at it from the front, you see Triangle, and when you look at it from the right, you see Circle, and from above, you see Cross.\n\nTherefore, the top is Cross, front is Triangle, right is Circle.\n\nSo, the left face of Cube C is opposite the right face, which is Circle, so left face is opposite Circle.\n\nBut the left face of Cube C is adjacent to Cube B's right face.\n\nSo, Cube B's right face is adjacent to Cube C's left face, which is opposite Circle, so Cube B's right face is adjacent to the left face of Cube C, which is not Circle.\n\nBut I don't know what's on Cube B's right face yet.\n\nSimilarly, Cube B's front is Circle, top is Square.\n\nSo, Cube B is oriented with front=Circle, top=Square.\n\nTherefore, the top face is Square, front is Circle.\n\nSo, the right face of Cube B is adjacent to the top face (Square) and the front face (Circle). Wait, no, the right face is adjacent to the top face if it's on the top-right corner.\n\nBut in 3D, the right face of Cube B is adjacent to the top face only if the top is facing towards me.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to use the standard cube orientation where front, top, right, etc., are as per the standard view.\n\nBut since the cubes are placed on a table, their orientations are such that front, back, left, right, top, bottom are as per their positions.\n\nSo, for Cube B, front=Circle, top=Square.\n\nSo, the front is Circle, top is Square.\n\nTherefore, the right face of Cube B is to the right of the front face, which is Circle, and the top is Square above the front face.\n\nSo, the right face of Cube B would be adjacent to the top face (Square) and the front face (Circle). Therefore, the right face of Cube B is adjacent to both.\n\nSimilarly, the right face of Cube C is adjacent to the top face (Cross) and the front face (Triangle).\n\nSo, the right face of Cube C is adjacent to both Cross (top) and Triangle (front).\n\nTherefore, the right face of Cube C is adjacent to both Cross and Triangle.\n\nNow, since the right face of Cube C is Circle, that means the face adjacent to both the top (Cross) and front (Triangle) is Circle.\n\nTherefore, the right face is Circle, which is adjacent to Cross (top) and Triangle (front).\n\nSimilarly, the right face of Cube B is adjacent to Square (top) and Circle (front). Wait, no, Cube B's front is Circle, so the right face is adjacent to Circle (front) and Square (top). So, the right face of Cube B is adjacent to both Circle and Square.\n\nBut the right face of Cube C is Circle, and it's adjacent to Cross and Triangle.\n\nNow, considering that the right face of Cube C is Circle, and it's adjacent to Cross (top) and Triangle (front), we can infer that the right face is the one that is both above (top) and in front (front). So, the right face is the face that is both on the top and front, which is the top-right face.\n\nSimilarly, for Cube B, the right face is adjacent to both the top (Square) and front (Circle), so it's also the top-right face.\n\nBut for Cube B, the right face is adjacent to Square (top) and Circle (front). So, the right face is the top-right face.\n\nSimilarly, for Cube C, the right face is adjacent to Cross (top) and Triangle (front), so it's also the top-right face.\n\nWait, but each cube's right face is adjacent to the top face and front face, which in a standard cube, the right face is indeed adjacent to both top and front.\n\nWait, no, in a standard cube, the right face is adjacent to the top and front, but in this case, since the cubes are placed on a table, the top is above, front is towards me, and right is to the right.\n\nSo, the right face is adjacent to the top and front, but the right face is also adjacent to the bottom and back.\n\nBut in this problem, we are given the front, top, and right face of Cube C.\n\nSo, for Cube C, front=Triangle, right=Circle, top=Cross.\n\nTherefore, the right face is adjacent to both top (Cross) and front (Triangle), so the right face is the one that is both on the top and front, which is the top-right face.\n\nSimilarly, for Cube B, front=Circle, right= ?, top=Square.\n\nSo, the right face of Cube B is adjacent to Square (top) and Circle (front), so it's the top-right face.\n\nNow, considering that the right face of Cube C is Circle, which is the top-right face of Cube C.\n\nSimilarly, the right face of Cube B is adjacent to Square and Circle, so it's the top-right face of Cube B.\n\nBut the right face of Cube B is adjacent to the left face of Cube C.\n\nSo, the left face of Cube C is opposite the right face, which is Circle, so the left face is the opposite of Circle, which is another pattern.\n\nBut the left face of Cube C is adjacent to Cube B's right face.\n\nSo, Cube B's right face is adjacent to Cube C's left face.\n\nBut Cube B's right face is the top-right face, which is adjacent to Square (top) and Circle (front).\n\nWait, this is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should try to figure out the possible orientations.\n\nLet me try to assign the patterns to the faces.\n\nEach cube has six faces: front, back, left, right, top, bottom.\n\nPatterns: Star, Circle, Triangle, Square, Heart, Cross.\n\nEach cube has a unique combination of these on its six faces.\n\nBut in this problem, the cubes are identical, so each cube has the same set of patterns, but arranged differently.\n\nWait, no, the problem says each cube has a different pattern on each face. Wait, no, each cube has different patterns on each face, but all six patterns are used across the three cubes.\n\nWait, actually, the problem says: \"three identical cubes, each with a different pattern on each face: stars, circles, triangles, squares, hearts, and crosses.\"\n\nSo, each cube has six different patterns, one on each face, using all six: star, circle, triangle, square, heart, cross. So, each cube has all six patterns, but arranged differently.\n\nTherefore, each cube has a permutation of these six patterns on its six faces.\n\nSo, each cube has a front, back, left, right, top, and bottom face, each with a unique pattern.\n\nGiven that, the problem is about determining the orientation of each cube such that the front, top, and right faces match the given observations.\n\nSo, let me try to figure out the orientation of each cube.\n\nStarting with Cube C (rightmost). We know:\n\n- Front face: Triangle\n\n- Right face: Circle (given)\n\n- Top face: Cross\n\nSo, Cube C's front=Triangle, right=Circle, top=Cross.\n\nTherefore, the other faces are back, left, and bottom.\n\nSince each face has a unique pattern, the remaining patterns for Cube C are Star, Square, and Heart.\n\nSo, back face: ?\n\nLeft face: ?\n\nBottom face: ?\n\nSimilarly, Cube B (middle):\n\n- Front face: Circle\n\n- Top face: Square\n\nTherefore, the remaining patterns for Cube B are Star, Triangle, Heart, Cross, and the other side (right and left, but wait, no, each cube has six faces, so Cube B has front=Circle, top=Square, and the other four faces (right, left, back, bottom) have the remaining patterns: Star, Triangle, Heart, Cross.\n\nSimilarly, Cube A (leftmost):\n\n- Front face: Star\n\n- Top face: Heart\n\nSo, the remaining patterns for Cube A are Circle, Triangle, Square, Cross, and the other four faces (right, left, back, bottom) have the remaining patterns.\n\nWait, no, each cube has all six patterns, so Cube A has front=Star, top=Heart, so the remaining four faces (right, left, back, bottom) have Circle, Triangle, Square, Cross.\n\nSimilarly, Cube B has front=Circle, top=Square, so the remaining four faces have Star, Triangle, Heart, Cross.\n\nCube C has front=Triangle, top=Cross, right=Circle, so the remaining faces (left, back, bottom) have Star, Square, Heart.\n\nNow, the key is to figure out the orientation of each cube such that the adjacent faces match when considering the placement in a row.\n\nSince the cubes are in a row, each cube's right face is adjacent to the next cube's left face.\n\nSo, Cube A's right face is adjacent to Cube B's left face.\n\nSimilarly, Cube B's right face is adjacent to Cube C's left face.\n\nGiven that, and knowing the right face of Cube C is Circle, we can figure out the left face of Cube C.\n\nBut the left face of Cube C is opposite its right face, so left face of Cube C is opposite Circle.\n\nTherefore, Cube C's left face is the opposite of Circle, which is another pattern.\n\nBut what's opposite to Circle? Since each cube's opposite faces are opposite in the arrangement.\n\nWait, no, the opposite faces are determined by the cube's orientation, not necessarily the patterns. So, the left face of Cube C is the face opposite to its right face, which is Circle. So, the left face is the opposite of Circle, but in terms of the cube's structure, not the pattern.\n\nBut the pattern on the left face is a different pattern, not necessarily the opposite in the pattern sense.\n\nWait, no, the opposite face in terms of the cube's structure is just the face opposite in space, regardless of the pattern.\n\nSo, for Cube C, the right face is Circle, so the left face is the opposite face in terms of the cube's structure, but the pattern on it is another pattern, which we need to determine.\n\nSimilarly, the front face is Triangle, so the back face is the opposite of Triangle.\n\nBut we don't know what's on the back face yet.\n\nSimilarly, the top face is Cross, so the bottom face is the opposite of Cross.\n\nBut again, we don't know yet.\n\nSo, let's try to figure out the left face of Cube C.\n\nCube C's right face is Circle, so the left face is opposite to Circle, meaning it's the left face in terms of structure.\n\nBut the pattern on the left face is another pattern, which we need to determine.\n\nSimilarly, Cube C's front is Triangle, so back is opposite.\n\nTop is Cross, so bottom is opposite.\n\nBut how does this help?\n\nWell, since Cube B's right face is adjacent to Cube C's left face, and Cube B's right face is a certain pattern, which we can figure out based on Cube B's orientation.\n\nLet me try to figure out Cube B's orientation.\n\nCube B has front=Circle, top=Square.\n\nSo, front=Circle, top=Square.\n\nTherefore, the cube is oriented such that when viewed from the front, it's Circle, and from above, it's Square.\n\nTherefore, the right face of Cube B is adjacent to both the front (Circle) and the top (Square).\n\nSo"

    "solution": "Solve this problem step by step. End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: You have three identical cubes, each with a different pattern on each face: stars, circles, triangles, squares, hearts, and crosses. The cubes are placed in a row on a table. Looking at the front faces of the three cubes from left to right, you see: star, circle, triangle. Looking at the top faces from left to right, you see: heart, square, cross. Looking at the right side of the rightmost cube, you see a circle. What pattern appears on the left side of the leftmost cube? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nTo solve this problem, I'll start by assigning each pattern to a cube. There are six unique patterns: star, circle, triangle, square, heart, and cross. Since there are three cubes, each cube will have three different patterns, and each pattern will be used exactly once across all cubes.\n\nFirst, I'll list the given information:\n\n- **Front Faces (from left to right):** Star, Circle, Triangle\n- **Top Faces (from left to right):** Heart, Square, Cross\n- **Right Side of the Rightmost Cube:** Circle\n\nNow, I'll assign the front faces to the cubes:\n\n1. **Leftmost Cube:** Star\n2. **Middle Cube:** Circle\n3. **Rightmost Cube:** Triangle\n\nNext, I'll assign the top faces to the cubes:\n\n1. **Leftmost Cube:** Heart\n2. **Middle Cube:** Square\n3. **Rightmost Cube:** Cross\n\nFinally, I'll use the information about the right side of the rightmost cube to determine the remaining pattern. Since the right side of the rightmost cube is a circle, that means the right face of the rightmost cube has a circle. This implies that the right face of the rightmost cube is the circle, and the remaining pattern (square) must be on the left or back face.\n\nHowever, to ensure each cube has three unique patterns and all patterns are used exactly once, the rightmost cube must have circle on the right face. Therefore, the left face of the leftmost cube must be the square to accommodate all patterns without repetition.\n\nThus, the pattern on the left side of the leftmost cube is the square.\n</think>\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step to determine the pattern on the left side of the leftmost cube.\n\n### **Given Information:**\n1. **Front Faces (from left to right):**\n   - Leftmost Cube: **Star**\n   - Middle Cube: **Circle**\n   - Rightmost Cube: **Triangle**\n\n2. **Top Faces (from left to right):**\n   - Leftmost Cube: **Heart**\n   - Middle Cube: **Square**\n   - Rightmost Cube: **Cross**\n\n3. **Right Side of the Rightmost Cube:** **Circle**\n\n### **Step-by-Step Solution:**\n\n1. **Identify the Patterns on Each Cube:**\n   - Each cube has three distinct patterns.\n   - There are six unique patterns: **Star, Circle, Triangle, Square, Heart, Cross.**\n   - Since there are three cubes, each pattern will be used exactly once across all cubes.\n\n2. **Assign the Front Faces:**\n   - **Leftmost Cube:** **Star**\n   - **Middle Cube:** **Circle**\n   - **Rightmost Cube:** **Triangle**\n\n3. **Assign the Top Faces:**\n   - **Leftmost Cube:** **Heart**\n   - **Middle Cube:** **Square**\n   - **Rightmost Cube:** **Cross**\n\n4. **Analyze the Rightmost Cube:**\n   - The **right side** of the **Rightmost Cube** is **Circle**.\n   - This means the **right face** of the Rightmost Cube is **Circle**.\n   - Therefore, the remaining two faces (top and left) must be **Cross** and **Square**.\n\n5. **Determine the Left Face of the Leftmost Cube:**\n   - From the top faces:\n     - **Leftmost Cube:** **Heart**\n     - **Middle Cube:** **Square**\n     - **Rightmost Cube:** **Cross**\n   - The **Square** is already assigned to the **Middle Cube**'s top face.\n   - Therefore, the **Square** cannot be on the left face of the **Leftmost Cube**.\n   - The remaining pattern for the **Leftmost Cube** is **Square** on the **left face**.\n\n### **Final Answer:**\n\nThe pattern on the left side of the leftmost cube is \\(\\boxed{\\text{Square}}\\).\n\n**DONE.**"

Looking at the top faces from left to right, you see: heart, square, cross. Looking at the right side of the rightmost cube, you see a circle. What pattern appears on the left side of the leftmost cube? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nFirst, I need to understand the problem. There are three identical cubes, each with a different pattern on each face: stars, circles, triangles, squares, hearts, and crosses. The cubes are placed in a row on a table. The front faces visible from left to right are star, circle, and triangle. The top faces visible from left to right are heart, square, and cross. Additionally, the right side of the rightmost cube has a circle. I need to determine the pattern on the left side of the leftmost cube.\n\nLet me list the visible information:\n\n1. **Front Faces (Left to Right):** Star, Circle, Triangle\n2. **Top Faces (Left to Right):** Heart, Square, Cross\n3. **Right Side of Rightmost Cube:** Circle\n\nEach cube has six faces, and since they're identical, each face must correspond uniquely to one of the six patterns: star, circle, triangle, square, heart, and cross.\n\nI'll start by assigning the front faces based on the given information:\n\n- **Leftmost Cube:** Star (Front)\n- **Middle Cube:** Circle (Front)\n- **Rightmost Cube:** Triangle (Front)\n\nNext, I'll consider the top faces. Each cube also has a top face, which is visible from above:\n\n- **Leftmost Cube:** Heart (Top)\n- **Middle Cube:** Square (Top)\n- **Rightmost Cube:** Cross (Top)\n\nNow, I'll analyze the right side of the rightmost cube. The right side of the rightmost cube is the right face of that cube. Since each cube has six faces, and the front, top, and right faces are already assigned, I can determine the remaining faces for each cube.\n\nFor the rightmost cube:\n\n- **Front:** Triangle\n- **Top:** Cross\n- **Right:** Circle\n\nThis means the left, back, and bottom faces of the rightmost cube must be the remaining patterns: Star, Square, and Heart.\n\nNow, I'll look at the middle cube:\n\n- **Front:** Circle\n- **Top:** Square\n- **Right:** ?\n\nSince each pattern must be unique, the right face of the middle cube cannot be Circle, Square, or Heart (as these are already assigned to the front and top). Therefore, the right face of the middle cube must be either Star, Triangle, or Cross.\n\nHowever, the right face of the rightmost cube is Circle, and all patterns must be unique. So, the right face of the middle cube cannot be Circle. Therefore, it must be either Star, Triangle, or Cross.\n\nAssuming the right face of the middle cube is Star:\n\n- **Middle Cube:** Circle (Front), Square (Top), Star (Right)\n\nThen, the remaining faces for the middle cube (Left and Back) would be Triangle and Heart.\n\nBut the front face of the rightmost cube is Triangle, and the top face is Cross. So, the left face of the rightmost cube would need to be either Star, Square, or Heart.\n\nBut the left face of the leftmost cube is what we're trying to determine, and the left face of the leftmost cube is adjacent to the right face of the middle cube.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the adjacent faces. Each cube is placed in a row, so the right face of the leftmost cube is adjacent to the left face of the middle cube, and the right face of the middle cube is adjacent to the left face of the rightmost cube.\n\nSo, the right face of the leftmost cube is adjacent to the left face of the middle cube, and the right face of the middle cube is adjacent to the left face of the rightmost cube.\n\nGiven that, let's see:\n\n- **Leftmost Cube:** Star (Front), Heart (Top), ? (Left), ? (Right), ? (Back), ? (Bottom)\n- **Middle Cube:** Circle (Front), Square (Top), ? (Left), ? (Right), ? (Back), ? (Bottom)\n- **Rightmost Cube:** Triangle (Front), Cross (Top), Circle (Right), ? (Left), ? (Back), ? (Bottom)\n\nEach cube must have all six patterns, so each face must be unique.\n\nFrom the leftmost cube:\n\n- Front: Star\n- Top: Heart\n- Left: ?\n- Right: ?\n- Back: ?\n- Bottom: ?\n\nFrom the middle cube:\n\n- Front: Circle\n- Top: Square\n- Left: ?\n- Right: ?\n- Back: ?\n- Bottom: ?\n\nFrom the rightmost cube:\n\n- Front: Triangle\n- Top: Cross\n- Right: Circle\n- Left: ?\n- Back: ?\n- Bottom: ?\n\nNow, considering the right face of the rightmost cube is Circle, and each pattern is unique, the left face of the rightmost cube cannot be Circle.\n\nSo, the left face of the rightmost cube must be either Star, Square, Triangle, or Heart.\n\nBut the front face of the rightmost cube is Triangle, and the top is Cross. So, the left face can be Star, Square, or Heart.\n\nNow, let's consider the right face of the leftmost cube. It is adjacent to the left face of the middle cube. Since the middle cube's left face is adjacent to the leftmost cube's right face, and all patterns are unique, we need to ensure that the right face of the leftmost cube is not equal to the left face of the middle cube.\n\nSimilarly, the right face of the middle cube is adjacent to the left face of the rightmost cube.\n\nGiven that, let's try to assign the left face of the rightmost cube.\n\nIf the left face of the rightmost cube is Star:\n\n- Rightmost Cube: Left = Star\n\nThen, the right face of the leftmost cube must be different from the left face of the middle cube. But we need to determine the left face of the middle cube.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the top face as well. The top face of the leftmost cube is Heart, so the bottom face of the leftmost cube is adjacent to the top face of the middle cube, which is Square. So, the bottom face of the leftmost cube must be different from Square. Therefore, the bottom face of the leftmost cube could be Triangle, Heart, Star, or Cross.\n\nBut the leftmost cube's front is Star, top is Heart, right is ?, left is ?, back is ?, bottom is ?.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to create a table.\n\nLet me try to list all the faces for each cube.\n\nLeftmost Cube:\n\n- Front: Star\n- Top: Heart\n- Left: ?\n- Right: ?\n- Back: ?\n- Bottom: ?\n\nMiddle Cube:\n\n- Front: Circle\n- Top: Square\n- Left: ?\n- Right: ?\n- Back: ?\n- Bottom: ?\n\nRightmost Cube:\n\n- Front: Triangle\n- Top: Cross\n- Right: Circle\n- Left: ?\n- Back: ?\n- Bottom: ?\n\nNow, each cube must have all six patterns: Star, Circle, Triangle, Square, Heart, Cross.\n\nSo, for the leftmost cube, the remaining faces to assign are Left, Right, Back, and Bottom. The available patterns are Circle, Square, Triangle, and Cross.\n\nBut the top face is Heart, so the bottom face cannot be Heart.\n\nWait, no, the bottom face is separate. The top face is Heart, so the bottom face can still be any of the remaining.\n\nWait, no, the top face is Heart, so the bottom face is a different face.\n\nSo, for the leftmost cube, the remaining faces to assign are Left, Right, Back, and Bottom, which must be Circle, Square, Triangle, and Cross.\n\nSimilarly for the middle cube, the remaining faces are Left, Right, Back, and Bottom, which must be Star, Triangle, Heart, and Cross.\n\nFor the rightmost cube, the remaining faces are Left, Back, and Bottom, which must be Star, Square, and Heart.\n\nNow, let's try to assign the left face of the middle cube. The right face of the leftmost cube is adjacent to the left face of the middle cube.\n\nSo, if the left face of the middle cube is Star, then the right face of the leftmost cube cannot be Star.\n\nSimilarly, if the left face of the middle cube is Triangle, the right face of the leftmost cube cannot be Triangle.\n\nSame with Heart and Cross.\n\nBut we need to ensure that all patterns are unique across the cubes.\n\nLet me try to assign the left face of the middle cube.\n\nPossible options for middle cube's left face: Star, Triangle, Heart, Cross.\n\nBut the left face of the middle cube must not be the same as the right face of the leftmost cube.\n\nSimilarly, the right face of the middle cube must not be the same as the left face of the rightmost cube.\n\nAnd the left face of the rightmost cube must not be the same as the right face of the middle cube.\n\nAlso, all six patterns must be used.\n\nLet me try to assign the left face of the middle cube as Star.\n\nIf Middle Cube's Left = Star.\n\nThen, the right face of the leftmost cube cannot be Star.\n\nSo, the right face of the leftmost cube can be Circle, Square, Triangle, or Cross.\n\nBut the leftmost cube's right face is adjacent to the middle cube's left face (Star), so it can be any except Star.\n\nNow, for the middle cube, after assigning Left = Star, the remaining faces to assign are Right, Back, and Bottom, which must be Circle, Triangle, Heart, Cross.\n\nWait, no, the middle cube's remaining faces after Front (Circle), Top (Square), Left (Star) are Right, Back, and Bottom, which must be Triangle, Heart, Cross.\n\nBecause the total patterns are Star, Circle, Triangle, Square, Heart, Cross.\n\nSo, Middle Cube:\n\n- Front: Circle\n- Top: Square\n- Left: Star\n- Right: ?\n- Back: ?\n- Bottom: ?\n\nRemaining: Triangle, Heart, Cross.\n\nSo, Middle Cube's Right, Back, and Bottom must be Triangle, Heart, Cross in some order.\n\nNow, the right face of the middle cube is adjacent to the left face of the rightmost cube.\n\nThe right face of the middle cube cannot be the same as the left face of the rightmost cube.\n\nSo, let's assume Middle Cube's Right = Triangle.\n\nThen, the left face of the rightmost cube cannot be Triangle.\n\nSo, the left face of the rightmost cube can be Star, Square, or Heart.\n\nBut the rightmost cube's left face is adjacent to the middle cube's right face (Triangle), so it can't be Triangle.\n\nSimilarly, the rightmost cube's left face can be Star, Square, or Heart.\n\nNow, the rightmost cube's remaining faces after Front (Triangle), Top (Cross), Right (Circle) are Left, Back, and Bottom, which must be Star, Square, Heart.\n\nSo, let's assign the left face of the rightmost cube.\n\nIf Middle Cube's Right = Triangle, then the left face of the rightmost cube can be Star, Square, or Heart.\n\nLet's try Left = Star.\n\nThen, the rightmost cube's Left = Star.\n\nNow, the remaining faces for the rightmost cube are Back and Bottom, which must be Square and Heart.\n\nSo, Rightmost Cube:\n\n- Front: Triangle\n- Top: Cross\n- Right: Circle\n- Left: Star\n- Back: Square\n- Bottom: Heart\n\nNow, let's check the leftmost cube.\n\nLeftmost Cube:\n\n- Front: Star\n- Top: Heart\n- Left: ?\n- Right: ?\n- Back: ?\n- Bottom: ?\n\nThe remaining patterns for the leftmost cube are Left, Right, Back, and Bottom, which must be Circle, Square, Triangle, Cross.\n\nBut the right face of the leftmost cube is adjacent to the left face of the middle cube (Star). So, the right face of the leftmost cube can't be Star.\n\nAlso, the right face of the leftmost cube must be unique.\n\nFrom the patterns available for the leftmost cube's Right: Circle, Square, Triangle, Cross.\n\nBut the middle cube's left face is Star, so the leftmost cube's right face can be any except Star.\n\nSo, possible options: Circle, Square, Triangle, Cross.\n\nBut the middle cube's right face is Triangle, so the leftmost cube's right face can't be Triangle (since all patterns are unique).\n\nTherefore, the leftmost cube's right face can be Circle, Square, or Cross.\n\nBut the rightmost cube's left face is Star, and the leftmost cube's right face is adjacent to the middle cube's left face (Star). So, the leftmost cube's right face can be any except Star.\n\nNow, let's consider the right face of the leftmost cube.\n\nIf Leftmost Cube's Right = Circle.\n\nThen, the remaining faces for the leftmost cube are Left, Back, and Bottom, which must be Square, Triangle, Cross.\n\nBut the left face of the leftmost cube is adjacent to the right face of the middle cube (which is Triangle). So, the left face of the leftmost cube can't be Triangle.\n\nSo, Leftmost Cube's Left can be Square or Cross.\n\nIf Left = Square.\n\nThen, the remaining faces are Triangle and Cross for Back and Bottom.\n\nSo, Leftmost Cube:\n\n- Front: Star\n- Top: Heart\n- Left: Square\n- Right: Circle\n- Back: Triangle\n- Bottom: Cross\n\nNow, let's check if all patterns are used.\n\nLeftmost Cube: Star, Heart, Square, Circle, Triangle, Cross.\n\nMiddle Cube: Circle, Square, Star, Triangle, Heart, Cross.\n\nWait, no, Middle Cube's faces are:\n\n- Front: Circle\n- Top: Square\n- Left: Star\n- Right: Triangle\n- Back: Heart\n- Bottom: Cross\n\nYes, that uses all six patterns.\n\nRightmost Cube:\n\n- Front: Triangle\n- Top: Cross\n- Right: Circle\n- Left: Star\n- Back: Square\n- Bottom: Heart\n\nThat also uses all six patterns.\n\nBut wait, the right face of the leftmost cube is Circle, which is the same as the right face of the rightmost cube, but they are different cubes, so that's okay.\n\nHowever, the left face of the middle cube is Star, which is the same as the left face of the rightmost cube. But each cube's faces are unique within that cube, but across cubes, the same pattern can be on different faces.\n\nWait, the problem says each cube has a different pattern on each face. So, each cube has six unique patterns, but different cubes can have the same pattern on different faces.\n\nSo, it's okay for different cubes to have the same pattern on different faces.\n\nSo, in this assignment, the left face of the middle cube is Star, and the left face of the rightmost cube is Star. That's allowed because they are different cubes.\n\nSimilarly, the right face of the leftmost cube is Circle, and the right face of the rightmost cube is Circle. Again, different cubes, same pattern on different faces. That's okay.\n\nSo, this assignment seems to work.\n\nBut let's check another possibility to ensure there's no conflict.\n\nAlternative: If Middle Cube's Right = Heart.\n\nThen, the left face of the rightmost cube cannot be Heart.\n\nSo, the left face of the rightmost cube can be Star, Square, or Triangle.\n\nBut the middle cube's right face is Heart, so the rightmost cube's left face can't be Heart.\n\nLet's try Middle Cube's Right = Heart.\n\nThen, the rightmost cube's Left can be Star, Square, or Triangle.\n\nSuppose Rightmost Cube's Left = Star.\n\nThen, the rightmost cube's Back and Bottom would be Square and Triangle.\n\nSo, Rightmost Cube:\n\n- Front: Triangle\n- Top: Cross\n- Right: Circle\n- Left: Star\n- Back: Square\n- Bottom: Triangle\n\nWait, but Triangle is already on the front face of the rightmost cube, so having Triangle on the bottom is okay because it's a different face.\n\nBut the problem is that the rightmost cube's front is Triangle, and its bottom is Triangle. That's allowed because it's different faces.\n\nBut then, the leftmost cube's right face is adjacent to the middle cube's left face (Star). So, the leftmost cube's right face can't be Star.\n\nIf the leftmost cube's right face is Circle, Square, Triangle, or Cross.\n\nBut the leftmost cube's right face is adjacent to the middle cube's left face (Star), so it can be any except Star.\n\nLet's try Leftmost Cube's Right = Circle.\n\nThen, the leftmost cube's remaining faces are Left, Back, and Bottom, which must be Square, Triangle, Cross.\n\nThe left face of the leftmost cube is adjacent to the right face of the middle cube (Heart). So, the left face of the leftmost cube can't be Heart, which it isn't.\n\nSo, Left = Square, Triangle, or Cross.\n\nIf Left = Square.\n\nThen, Back and Bottom would be Triangle and Cross.\n\nSo, Leftmost Cube:\n\n- Front: Star\n- Top: Heart\n- Left: Square\n- Right: Circle\n- Back: Triangle\n- Bottom: Cross\n\nThis uses all six patterns.\n\nMiddle Cube:\n\n- Front: Circle\n- Top: Square\n- Left: Star\n- Right: Heart\n- Back: ?\n- Bottom: ?\n\nRemaining patterns: Triangle and Cross.\n\nSo, Middle Cube:\n\n- Front: Circle\n- Top: Square\n- Left: Star\n- Right: Heart\n- Back: Triangle\n- Bottom: Cross\n\nThat works.\n\nRightmost Cube:\n\n- Front: Triangle\n- Top: Cross\n- Right: Circle\n- Left: Star\n- Back: Square\n- Bottom: Triangle\n\nBut here, the rightmost cube's front is Triangle, and its bottom is Triangle. That's allowed.\n\nBut wait, the rightmost cube's left face is Star, which is the same as the middle cube's left face. That's okay because they are different cubes.\n\nSimilarly, the right face of the leftmost cube is Circle, same as the right face of the rightmost cube. Also okay.\n\nSo, this assignment also works.\n\nBut in this case, the left face of the leftmost cube is Square.\n\nWait, but in the first scenario, the left face of the leftmost cube was Square as well.\n\nHmm, perhaps the left face of the leftmost cube is Square regardless.\n\nWait, let me check.\n\nIn the first scenario:\n\nLeftmost Cube's Left = Square.\n\nIn the second scenario:\n\nLeftmost Cube's Left = Square.\n\nYes, in both cases, the left face of the leftmost cube is Square.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the assignment, the left face of the leftmost cube seems to be Square.\n\nBut wait, let me see if there's another possibility.\n\nSuppose Middle Cube's Right = Cross.\n\nThen, the left face of the rightmost cube can't be Cross.\n\nSo, the rightmost cube's Left can be Star, Square, or Triangle.\n\nLet's try Rightmost Cube's Left = Star.\n\nThen, the rightmost cube's Back and Bottom would be Square and Triangle.\n\nSo, Rightmost Cube:\n\n- Front: Triangle\n- Top: Cross\n- Right: Circle\n- Left: Star\n- Back: Square\n- Bottom: Triangle\n\nNow, the leftmost cube's Right face is adjacent to the middle"

    "solution": "Solve this problem step by step. End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: You have three identical cubes, each with a different pattern on each face: stars, circles, triangles, squares, hearts, and crosses. The cubes are placed in a row on a table. Looking at the front faces of the three cubes from left to right, you see: star, circle, triangle. Looking at the top faces from left to right, you see: heart, square, cross. Looking at the right side of the rightmost cube, you see a circle. What pattern appears on the left side of the leftmost cube? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nTo determine the pattern on the left side of the leftmost cube, I'll analyze the information provided step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll list the patterns visible on each cube based on the given observations:\n\n1. **Leftmost Cube (Cubl A):**\n   - **Front Face:** Star\n   - **Top Face:** Heart\n   - **Left Face:** Unknown (to be determined)\n\n2. **Middle Cube (Cube B):**\n   - **Front Face:** Circle\n   - **Top Face:** Square\n   - **Right Face:** Circle (from the right side of the rightmost cube)\n\n3. **Rightmost Cube (Cube C):**\n   - **Front Face:** Triangle\n   - **Top Face:** Cross\n   - **Right Face:** Circle\n\nNext, I'll consider the possible connections between the front and top patterns. Each cube has six faces, and each face is associated with a unique pattern: stars, circles, triangles, squares, hearts, and crosses.\n\nFor Cube A, since the front face is a star and the top face is a heart, the left face must be one of the remaining patterns: circles, squares, or crosses.\n\nFor Cube B, the front face is a circle, and the top face is a square. The right face is also a circle, which suggests that the circle pattern is used on both the front and right faces of Cube B.\n\nFor Cube C, the front face is a triangle, the top face is a cross, and the right face is a circle. This confirms that Cube C has a circle on its right face.\n\nNow, I'll try to assign the remaining patterns to each cube:\n\n- **Cube A:** Possible left face patterns are circles, squares, or crosses.\n- **Cube B:** Since Cube B already has a circle on its front and right faces, the remaining patterns are squares and crosses.\n- **Cube C:** The only remaining pattern for Cube C is a square, as it already has a triangle, cross, and circle.\n\nThis leads to the following assignments:\n\n- **Cube A:** Left face = Cross\n- **Cube B:** Left face = Square\n- **Cube C:** Left face = Square (but this seems inconsistent since each cube should have a unique pattern)\n\nUpon reviewing, I realize that Cube C cannot have a square on its left face because Cube B already has a square on its top face. Therefore, Cube C must have a cross on its left face instead.\n\nFinal Assignments:\n\n- **Cube A:** Left face = Cross\n- **Cube B:** Left face = Square\n- **Cube C:** Left face = Cross (This duplicates the cross pattern, which isn't allowed)\n\nThis indicates an inconsistency in the pattern assignments. Therefore, the cross pattern cannot be on the left face of Cube A without causing duplication. Thus, the left face of Cube A must be a square.\n\nFinal Answer:\nThe left side of the leftmost cube shows a square.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the pattern on the left side of the leftmost cube, let's analyze the information step by step.\n\n1. **Given Observations:**\n   - **Front Faces (Left to Right):** Star, Circle, Triangle.\n   - **Top Faces (Left to Right):** Heart, Square, Cross.\n   - **Right Side of the Rightmost Cube:** Circle.\n\n2. **Identify the Patterns on Each Cube:**\n   - **Leftmost Cube (Cubl A):**\n     - **Front:** Star\n     - **Top:** Heart\n     - **Left:** ?

To resolve this:\n\n- **Cube C:** Left = Cross\n\nNow, all patterns are uniquely assigned:\n\n- **Cube A:** Left = Cross\n- **Cube B:** Left = Square\n- **Cube C:** Left = Cross\n\nBut this duplicates the Cross pattern on Cubes A and C. Therefore, the correct assignment is:\n\n- **Cube A:** Left = Square\n- **Cube B:** Left = Cross\n- **Cube C:** Left = Square\n\nThis still duplicates the Square pattern on Cubes A and C. To avoid duplication, the correct assignment is:\n\n- **Cube A:** Left = Cross\n- **Cube B:** Left = Square\n- **Cube C:** Left = Cross\n\nThis is the most logical and consistent assignment without duplication.\n\n**Final Answer:**  \nThe left side of the leftmost cube shows a square.  \nDONE."

There are six distinct patterns: star, circle, triangle, square, heart, and cross.

The cubes are placed in a row on a table. Looking at the front faces of the three cubes from left to right, you see: star, circle, triangle. Looking at the top faces from left to right, you see: heart, square, cross. Looking at the right side of the rightmost cube, you see a circle. What pattern appears on the left side of the leftmost cube? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, let's try to solve this cube puzzle. So, we have three identical cubes, each with different patterns on their faces: stars, circles, triangles, squares, hearts, and crosses. They're placed in a row on a table. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out what each cube is showing on their front, top, and right faces. The problem gives me some information:\n\n1. From left to right, the front faces show: star, circle, triangle.\n2. From left to right, the top faces show: heart, square, cross.\n3. On the right side of the rightmost cube, there's a circle.\n\nAnd the question is asking about the pattern on the left side of the leftmost cube. So, I need to find out which pattern is on the left face of the first cube.\n\nLet me try to visualize this. Each cube has six faces: front, back, left, right, top, and bottom. Since all cubes are identical, each face must have a unique pattern.\n\nGiven that the rightmost cube has a circle on its right face, that means the right face of the third cube is a circle. So, the third cube's right face is a circle.\n\nLet me list down the front, top, and right faces for each cube:\n\n- Cube 1 (leftmost):\n  - Front: Star\n  - Top: Heart\n  - Right: ?\n\n- Cube 2 (middle):\n  - Front: Circle\n  - Top: Square\n  - Right: ?\n\n- Cube 3 (rightmost):\n  - Front: Triangle\n  - Top: Cross\n  - Right: Circle\n\nNow, since each cube has all six unique patterns, the left faces of all three cubes must be one of the remaining patterns: squares, triangles, hearts, crosses, and stars. Wait, but the front face of Cube 1 is a star, so the left face of Cube 1 can't be a star. Similarly, the front face of Cube 2 is a circle, so the left face of Cube 2 can't be a circle. The front face of Cube 3 is a triangle, so the left face of Cube 3 can't be a triangle.\n\nLet me list the possible left faces:\n\n- Cube 1: Left face can't be star, so possible: circles, triangles, squares, hearts, crosses. But the top face is heart, so the left face can't be heart either. So, left face of Cube 1: circles, triangles, squares, crosses.\n\n- Cube 2: Front is circle, so left face can't be circle. Top is square, so left face can't be square. So, left face of Cube 2: triangles, hearts, crosses.\n\n- Cube 3: Front is triangle, so left face can't be triangle. Top is cross, so left face can't be cross. So, left face of Cube 3: stars, squares, hearts.\n\nBut wait, the left faces must all be different because each cube is identical and each face has a unique pattern. So, the left faces of the three cubes must be three different patterns from the remaining options.\n\nLet me see what patterns are left. The total patterns are star, circle, triangle, square, heart, cross. Each cube has one of each. So, for the left faces:\n\n- Cube 1: left face options: circle, square, cross, triangle (but front is star, top is heart, so left can't be heart or star. Wait, no, Cube 1's front is star, top is heart, so left can be any except those two. So, possible left: circle, triangle, square, cross.\n\nBut let's check Cube 3. Cube 3's right face is circle, so Cube 3's right face is circle. Therefore, Cube 3's left face can't be circle because each cube has unique patterns. So, Cube 3's left face must be one of the remaining: star, square, heart, cross. But Cube 3's front is triangle, so left face can't be triangle. Also, top is cross, so left face can't be cross. So, Cube 3's left face must be star or square or heart.\n\nBut let's think about Cube 2. Cube 2's front is circle, top is square, so left face can't be circle or square. So, left face for Cube 2 is triangle, heart, or cross.\n\nWait, but the left faces must all be different. So, let's try to assign left faces:\n\nLet me list the possible left faces again:\n\n- Cube 1: circle, triangle, square, cross\n- Cube 2: triangle, heart, cross\n- Cube 3: star, square, heart\n\nWe need to assign three different patterns to Cube 1, 2, 3 left faces.\n\nLet me see if I can find a pattern. Maybe the left face of Cube 1 is the same as the top face of Cube 2 or something like that. Or maybe the right face of Cube 2 is the same as the top face of Cube 1 or something.\n\nWait, let's think about the orientation of each cube. Each cube has front, top, right, left, back, bottom. So, the front is fixed as the front face, top is top, right is right, left is left, back is back, and bottom is bottom.\n\nBut we don't know about the bottom faces, but maybe that's not needed.\n\nLet me try to assign the left faces step by step.\n\nFirst, Cube 3's right face is circle, so Cube 3's left face can't be circle. So, Cube 3's left face must be one of star, square, heart.\n\nSimilarly, Cube 2's left face can't be circle or square, so it's triangle, heart, or cross.\n\nCube 1's left face can't be star or heart, so it's circle, triangle, square, cross.\n\nWe need to assign three different left faces, so let's see.\n\nIf Cube 1's left face is circle, then Cube 2 can't have circle, so Cube 2's left face would be triangle, heart, or cross. Cube 3 can't have circle either, so it's star, square, heart.\n\nBut then, let's see if that's possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Cube 1's left face is triangle.\n\nBut let's try to find a consistent way.\n\nLet me think about the right face of Cube 2. Since Cube 2's front is circle, top is square, and right face is something. But we don't know Cube 2's right face. Similarly, Cube 2's left face is something, but we don't know.\n\nWait, maybe we can use the fact that each cube's right face is different from its front and top face.\n\nFor Cube 1: front is star, top is heart, right is something else.\n\nFor Cube 2: front is circle, top is square, right is something else.\n\nFor Cube 3: front is triangle, top is cross, right is circle.\n\nSo, Cube 3's right face is circle, which is also the front face of Cube 2.\n\nSo, circle is on Cube 2's front and Cube 3's right.\n\nBut each pattern is unique per cube, so each cube has one of each pattern. So, each cube has a unique set of front, top, left, right, back, bottom.\n\nWait, but the patterns are per cube, meaning each cube has one of each pattern on its faces. So, each cube has six faces, each with a different pattern: star, circle, triangle, square, heart, cross.\n\nSo, each cube has all six patterns on its six faces.\n\nTherefore, for each cube, the front, top, right, left, back, and bottom faces are all different.\n\nGiven that, let's try to figure out the left face of each cube.\n\nCube 3's right face is circle, so its left face can't be circle. So, Cube 3's left face is one of the remaining: star, square, heart, cross, but front is triangle, so left can't be triangle, top is cross, so left can't be cross. Therefore, Cube 3's left face is star, square, or heart.\n\nSimilarly, Cube 2's left face can't be circle (front) or square (top), so it's triangle, heart, or cross.\n\nCube 1's left face can't be star (front) or heart (top), so it's circle, triangle, square, cross.\n\nWe need to assign three different left faces to the three cubes, using the remaining patterns.\n\nLet me list the left face possibilities again:\n\nCube 1: circle, triangle, square, cross\n\nCube 2: triangle, heart, cross\n\nCube 3: star, square, heart\n\nWe need to assign three unique patterns to Cube 1, 2, 3 left faces.\n\nLet me try to see if Cube 1's left face is square.\n\nIf Cube 1's left face is square, then Cube 2 can't have square, so Cube 2's left face is triangle or heart or cross.\n\nCube 3's left face would then be star or heart, because square is taken.\n\nBut let's see if that works.\n\nCube 1: left = square\n\nCube 2: left = triangle, heart, or cross\n\nCube 3: left = star or heart\n\nBut we need three different left faces, so let's see:\n\nIf Cube 1: square\n\nCube 2: triangle\n\nCube 3: star\n\nThat would work because square, triangle, star are all different.\n\nAlternatively, Cube 1: square\n\nCube 2: heart\n\nCube 3: star\n\nOr Cube 1: square\n\nCube 2: cross\n\nCube 3: star\n\nBut let's check if that's possible.\n\nWait, let's think about Cube 2's right face.\n\nCube 2's front is circle, top is square, left is, say, triangle.\n\nThen, Cube 2's right face would have to be something else. Since each cube has all six patterns, Cube 2's right face is one of the remaining: star, heart, cross.\n\nBut we don't know which.\n\nSimilarly, Cube 1's right face is something else, not star, heart, or square (since top is heart, front is star, left is square).\n\nWait, Cube 1's front is star, top is heart, left is square, so right face must be one of the remaining: circle, triangle, cross.\n\nBut front is star, so right can't be star. Top is heart, so right can't be heart. Left is square, so right can't be square. So, right face of Cube 1 is circle, triangle, or cross.\n\nSimilarly, Cube 2's right face can't be circle (front), square (top), or whatever left face we assigned.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should try to find a consistent way.\n\nAlternatively, let's try to think about the arrangement of the cubes.\n\nEach cube has front, top, right, left, back, bottom.\n\nSince the cubes are placed in a row, the orientation is such that each cube's front is facing the same direction as the row. So, the front face of each cube is the one we see from the front, and the top face is the top when placed on the table.\n\nBut since they are placed in a row, each cube's right face is to the right of the cube, so the right face of Cube 2 is to the left of Cube 3's left face.\n\nBut Cube 3's right face is circle, so Cube 3's right face is circle. Therefore, Cube 3's right face is circle, which is also the front face of Cube 2.\n\nWait, no, Cube 2's front is circle, and Cube 3's right face is circle.\n\nBut each cube has all six patterns, so Cube 2's front is circle, and Cube 3's right face is circle, but that's okay because each cube can have circle on different faces.\n\nSo, the patterns are per cube, not per face position.\n\nTherefore, each cube has a unique set of front, top, left, right, back, bottom, with all six patterns.\n\nSo, let's try to assign the left faces.\n\nCube 1: left face options: circle, triangle, square, cross\n\nCube 2: left face options: triangle, heart, cross\n\nCube 3: left face options: star, square, heart\n\nWe need to assign three unique left faces.\n\nLet me try to assign Cube 1's left face as square.\n\nSo, Cube 1: left = square\n\nThen, Cube 2's left face can't be square, so it's either triangle, heart, or cross.\n\nCube 3's left face can't be square either, so it's star, heart.\n\nBut Cube 3's left face can't be cross because top is cross.\n\nWait, Cube 3's top is cross, so Cube 3's left face can't be cross. So, Cube 3's left face is star or heart.\n\nSo, if Cube 1: square\n\nCube 2: let's say triangle\n\nCube 3: star\n\nThat would work because square, triangle, star are all different.\n\nAlternatively, Cube 2: heart\n\nCube 3: star\n\nOr Cube 2: cross\n\nCube 3: star\n\nBut let's see if that works with the rest.\n\nIf Cube 1: left = square\n\nCube 2: left = triangle\n\nCube 3: left = star\n\nIs that possible?\n\nYes, because square, triangle, star are all different.\n\nNow, let's check if the right faces make sense.\n\nCube 1: front = star, top = heart, left = square, so right face must be one of the remaining: circle, triangle, cross.\n\nBut Cube 1's front is star, top is heart, left is square, so right can't be any of those. So, right face is circle, triangle, or cross.\n\nCube 2: front = circle, top = square, left = triangle, so right face must be one of the remaining: star, heart, cross.\n\nCube 3: front = triangle, top = cross, left = star, so right face must be one of the remaining: circle, square, heart.\n\nBut we know Cube 3's right face is circle, so that's fixed.\n\nSo, Cube 3's right face is circle.\n\nTherefore, Cube 3's right face is circle, which is the front face of Cube 2.\n\nSo, Cube 2's front is circle, which is the same as Cube 3's right face.\n\nThat's okay because each cube has all six patterns, so Cube 2 has circle on its front face, and Cube 3 has circle on its right face.\n\nNow, let's see if Cube 1's right face is triangle.\n\nIf Cube 1's right face is triangle, then Cube 1's right face is triangle.\n\nCube 1: front = star, top = heart, left = square, right = triangle\n\nSo, Cube 1's back face would be cross, and bottom face would be... wait, we don't need the bottom.\n\nSimilarly, Cube 2: front = circle, top = square, left = triangle, right face must be one of star, heart, cross.\n\nBut Cube 2's right face can't be circle (front), square (top), or triangle (left). So, right face is star, heart, or cross.\n\nCube 2's right face is, say, star.\n\nThen, Cube 2's back face would be cross, and bottom face would be heart.\n\nBut let's check if that's possible.\n\nWait, Cube 2's top is square, front is circle, left is triangle, right is star.\n\nSo, Cube 2's back face would be cross, and bottom face would be heart.\n\nSimilarly, Cube 3: front = triangle, top = cross, left = star, right = circle.\n\nSo, Cube 3's back face is heart, and bottom face is square.\n\nWait, but let's check if all the patterns are unique per cube.\n\nCube 1: front=star, top=heart, left=square, right=triangle, back= cross, bottom= ?\n\nWait, Cube 1's faces: star, heart, square, triangle, cross, and the remaining is cross is already on the right face? Wait, no, Cube 1's right face is triangle.\n\nWait, no, Cube 1's front is star, top is heart, left is square, right is triangle, so back would be cross, and bottom would be circle.\n\nYes, because each cube has all six: star, circle, triangle, square, heart, cross.\n\nSo, Cube 1: front=star, top=heart, left=square, right=triangle, back= cross, bottom= circle.\n\nCube 2: front=circle, top=square, left=triangle, right=star, back= cross, bottom= heart.\n\nWait, but Cube 2's right face is star, and Cube 1's right face is triangle. That's okay because each cube's right face can be different.\n\nCube 3: front=triangle, top=cross, left=star, right=circle, back= heart, bottom= square.\n\nYes, that works because each cube has all six patterns.\n\nSo, in this arrangement, the left face of the leftmost cube (Cube 1) is square.\n\nBut let me check if there's another possible arrangement.\n\nSuppose Cube 1's left face is circle.\n\nThen, Cube 1: left=circle\n\nCube 2: left can't be circle (front) or square (top), so left=triangle, heart, cross.\n\nCube 3: left can't be circle (right face is circle, but each cube has unique patterns, so Cube 3's left face can't be circle. So, Cube 3's left face is star, square, heart.\n\nBut if Cube 1's left is circle, then Cube 3's left can't be circle, so it's star, square, heart.\n\nLet's try:\n\nCube 1: left=circle\n\nCube 2: left=triangle\n\nCube 3: left=star\n\nThen, Cube 1's right face would be one of the remaining: triangle, square, cross.\n\nBut Cube 1's front is star, top is heart, left is circle, so right can't be star, heart, or circle. So, right face is triangle, square, or cross.\n\nIf Cube 1's right face is triangle, then Cube 1's back is cross, and bottom is square.\n\nCube 2: front=circle, top=square, left=triangle, right face must be one of star, heart, cross.\n\nIf Cube 2's right face is star, then Cube 2's back is cross, bottom is heart.\n\nCube 3: front=triangle, top=cross, left=star, right=circle, back= heart, bottom= square.\n\nThis also works.\n\nSo, in this case, Cube 1's left face is circle.\n\nSo, we have two possible solutions:\n\nEither Cube 1's left face is square or circle.\n\nBut the problem states that the cubes are placed in a row, and we have to find the left face of the leftmost cube.\n\n"

End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: You have three identical cubes, each with a different pattern on each face: stars, circles, triangles, squares, hearts, and crosses. The cubes are placed in a row on a table. Looking at the front faces of the three cubes from left to right, you see: star, circle, triangle. Looking at the top faces from left to right, you see: heart, square, cross. Looking at the right side of the rightmost cube, you see a circle. What pattern appears on the left side of the leftmost cube? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this problem about three identical cubes, each with different patterns on their faces: stars, circles, triangles, squares, hearts, and crosses. They\u2019re placed in a row on a table. The front faces, from left to right, show a star, circle, and triangle. The top faces, from left to right, show a heart, square, and cross. Also, the right side of the rightmost cube has a circle. I need to figure out what pattern is on the left side of the leftmost cube.\n\nFirst, let me try to visualize this. There are three cubes, each with six different faces. The front, top, and right side of the rightmost cube are given. I need to figure out the left side of the leftmost cube. Since all cubes are identical, each cube has the same six patterns, but arranged differently.\n\nLet me list the information given:\n\n1. **Front faces (left to right):** Star, Circle, Triangle.\n2. **Top faces (left to right):** Heart, Square, Cross.\n3. **Right side of the rightmost cube:** Circle.\n\nSo, each cube's front face corresponds to one of the patterns, and the same for top and sides. Since each cube is identical, the arrangement of the patterns on each cube must be such that no two cubes share the same pattern arrangement.\n\nLet me denote the cubes as Cube A (leftmost), Cube B (middle), and Cube C (rightmost).\n\nFrom the front faces:\n- Cube A's front face: Star\n- Cube B's front face: Circle\n- Cube C's front face: Triangle\n\nFrom the top faces:\n- Cube A's top face: Heart\n- Cube B's top face: Square\n- Cube C's top face: Cross\n\nFrom the right side of Cube C: Circle.\n\nSo, each cube has a front, top, right, left, back, and bottom face. Since the cubes are placed on a table, I assume the bottom faces are not visible, and the top faces are visible.\n\nNow, I need to figure out the left side of Cube A, which is the leftmost cube.\n\nLet me think about Cube C first, since we know its front, top, and right face. The front is Triangle, top is Cross, and right is Circle.\n\nSince each cube has six faces, and each face is a different pattern, the remaining faces for Cube C are back, left, and bottom.\n\nSimilarly, for Cube B, front is Circle, top is Square, and right side is... wait, we don't know Cube B's right face yet. But we do know the right face of Cube C is Circle.\n\nWait, no, the problem says that the right side of the rightmost cube (Cube C) is a circle. It doesn't say anything about the right sides of the other cubes. So Cube B's right face is unknown, and Cube A's right face is also unknown.\n\nBut since the cubes are identical, each cube must have all six patterns. So each cube must have all six different patterns on their faces, but arranged differently.\n\nWait, but the problem says each cube has a different pattern on each face. Wait, no, the problem says each cube has different patterns on each face. Wait, actually, let me check:\n\n\"each with a different pattern on each face: stars, circles, triangles, squares, hearts, and crosses.\"\n\nWait, that wording is a bit confusing. Does it mean that each face has a different pattern, but all six patterns are used across the three cubes? Or does each cube have all six patterns on its faces?\n\nWait, let me read it again: \"each with a different pattern on each face: stars, circles, triangles, squares, hearts, and crosses.\"\n\nHmm, it's ambiguous. It could mean that each cube has six different patterns, one on each face, using all six given patterns across the three cubes. Or it could mean that each face has a different pattern, but not necessarily all six.\n\nBut given that there are three cubes and six patterns, it's more likely that each cube has four faces visible (front, top, right, left, and maybe back and bottom are hidden), but since we have three cubes, each with six faces, it's possible that each cube has all six patterns on their faces, but arranged differently.\n\nWait, the problem says \"each with a different pattern on each face,\" which suggests that each face has a different pattern, meaning each cube has all six patterns on its six faces. But since there are only three cubes, each cube must have all six patterns on their faces, but arranged differently.\n\nWait, no, that can't be because each cube has six faces, and there are only three cubes, so each cube would have two of each pattern, which contradicts the statement that each face has a different pattern.\n\nWait, perhaps I misinterpret it. Maybe each cube has different patterns, meaning each cube has a unique combination of patterns on its faces, but not necessarily all six.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"each with a different pattern on each face: stars, circles, triangles, squares, hearts, and crosses.\"\n\nSo, each cube has six different patterns on each face, but the total number of different patterns is six, so each cube must have all six patterns on its six faces, but arranged differently.\n\nSo, each cube has all six patterns, one on each face.\n\nTherefore, each cube has a permutation of the six patterns on its six faces.\n\nNow, the problem is about three cubes, each with a permutation of the six patterns on their faces.\n\nGiven that, let's proceed.\n\nSo, Cube A (leftmost) has front=Star, top=Heart, right=?\n\nCube B (middle) has front=Circle, top=Square, right=?\n\nCube C (rightmost) has front=Triangle, top=Cross, right=Circle.\n\nWe need to find the left face of Cube A.\n\nSince each cube has all six patterns, the remaining faces for each cube are determined by the given ones.\n\nLet me start with Cube C.\n\nCube C:\n- Front: Triangle\n- Top: Cross\n- Right: Circle\n\nSo, the remaining faces are left, back, and bottom. The remaining patterns are Star, Circle, Triangle, Square, Hearts, Cross. Wait, no, wait. Each cube has all six patterns, so Cube C must have:\n\nGiven: Triangle (front), Cross (top), Circle (right). Therefore, the remaining patterns are Star, Circle, Triangle, Square, Hearts, Cross. Wait, no, that's not right.\n\nWait, the total patterns are stars, circles, triangles, squares, hearts, crosses\u2014six patterns. Each cube must have one of each on their six faces. So, if Cube C has Triangle (front), Cross (top), Circle (right), then the remaining three faces (left, back, bottom) must be the other three patterns: Star, Square, Heart.\n\nSimilarly, Cube B has Circle (front), Square (top), and we don't know the right face yet. So, Cube B's right face is unknown, but since each cube must have all six patterns, Cube B must have Circle (front), Square (top), and the right face must be one of the remaining: Star, Triangle, Heart, Cross, Circle. Wait, no, since each cube must have all six, but Cube B already has Circle and Square on front and top. So, the right face cannot be Circle or Square. Therefore, the right face of Cube B must be one of Star, Triangle, Heart, or Cross.\n\nSimilarly, Cube A has Star (front), Heart (top), and the right face is unknown, but it must be one of the remaining patterns.\n\nWait, perhaps I should make a table.\n\nLet me denote each cube's faces:\n\nCube A:\n- Front: Star\n- Top: Heart\n- Right: ?\n- Left: ?\n- Back: ?\n- Bottom: ?\n\nCube B:\n- Front: Circle\n- Top: Square\n- Right: ?\n- Left: ?\n- Back: ?\n- Bottom: ?\n\nCube C:\n- Front: Triangle\n- Top: Cross\n- Right: Circle\n- Left: ?\n- Back: ?\n- Bottom: ?\n\nEach cube has all six patterns, so the remaining patterns for each cube are:\n\nCube A: needs to have Star, Heart, and three more: Circle, Triangle, Square, Cross. Wait, no. Each cube must have all six patterns, so Cube A already has Star and Heart. Therefore, the remaining three faces (right, left, back, bottom) must be Circle, Triangle, Square, Cross. Wait, but that's four patterns. Wait, no, each cube has six faces, so if Cube A has two patterns on front and top, it needs four more on the remaining four faces: right, left, back, bottom.\n\nWait, no, each cube has six faces, so if two are given, the other four are to be determined. But each cube must have all six patterns, so Cube A must have Star (front), Heart (top), and four more: Circle, Triangle, Square, Cross on the remaining four faces.\n\nSimilarly, Cube B has Circle (front), Square (top), and needs four more: Star, Triangle, Heart, Cross.\n\nCube C has Triangle (front), Cross (top), Circle (right), so needs three more on left, back, bottom: Star, Square, Heart.\n\nWait, that doesn't add up because each cube needs six faces, so Cube C has three given, needs three more.\n\nBut each cube must have all six, so Cube C's remaining three are Star, Square, Heart.\n\nSimilarly, Cube B needs four more, and Cube A needs four more.\n\nBut the total patterns are six, so each cube must have all six, but we have three cubes, so each cube must have all six, but with overlaps across cubes.\n\nWait, no, the problem says each cube has a different pattern on each face, meaning each face has a different pattern, but it doesn't specify that the patterns are unique across cubes. Wait, the problem says: \"each with a different pattern on each face: stars, circles, triangles, squares, hearts, and crosses.\"\n\nWait, perhaps it's that each cube has six different patterns on its faces, meaning each cube has all six patterns, but each cube's arrangement is different.\n\nSo, each cube has all six patterns, one on each face.\n\nTherefore, Cube A has Star (front), Heart (top), and the other four faces (right, left, back, bottom) must be the remaining four patterns: Circle, Triangle, Square, Cross.\n\nSimilarly, Cube B has Circle (front), Square (top), and the remaining four: Star, Triangle, Heart, Cross.\n\nCube C has Triangle (front), Cross (top), Circle (right), and the remaining three: Star, Square, Heart on left, back, bottom.\n\nSo, for Cube C, left, back, bottom must be Star, Square, Heart in some order.\n\nFor Cube B, right, left, back, bottom must be Star, Triangle, Heart, Cross in some order.\n\nFor Cube A, right, left, back, bottom must be Circle, Triangle, Square, Cross in some order.\n\nNow, we also know that the right face of Cube C is Circle. So, Cube C's right face is Circle.\n\nTherefore, Cube C's remaining faces (left, back, bottom) must be Star, Square, Heart.\n\nSimilarly, Cube B's right face is unknown, but we can figure it out.\n\nWait, the problem doesn't specify Cube B's right face, but we can perhaps deduce it.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the right side of the rightmost cube, you see a circle.\" So, Cube C's right face is Circle.\n\nNow, we need to figure out the left face of Cube A, which is the leftmost cube.\n\nLet me try to figure out Cube B's right face.\n\nCube B's front is Circle, top is Square. So, the right face is one of Star, Triangle, Heart, Cross.\n\nSimilarly, Cube A's right face is one of Circle, Triangle, Square, Cross.\n\nBut since each cube has all six, and each pattern is used exactly once per cube.\n\nWait, no, each cube has all six patterns on its faces, so each cube must have each of the six patterns once.\n\nSo, for Cube A:\n\nFront: Star\n\nTop: Heart\n\nRight: ?\n\nLeft: ?\n\nBack: ?\n\nBottom: ?\n\nSo, the remaining four: Circle, Triangle, Square, Cross.\n\nSimilarly, Cube B:\n\nFront: Circle\n\nTop: Square\n\nRight: ?\n\nLeft: ?\n\nBack: ?\n\nBottom: ?\n\nRemaining four: Star, Triangle, Heart, Cross.\n\nCube C:\n\nFront: Triangle\n\nTop: Cross\n\nRight: Circle\n\nLeft: ?\n\nBack: ?\n\nBottom: ?\n\nRemaining three: Star, Square, Heart.\n\nNow, let's think about the arrangement of the cubes. Since they're placed in a row, each cube is adjacent to the next one. So, the right face of Cube B is adjacent to the left face of Cube C.\n\nBut we don't know Cube B's right face yet, but we can perhaps figure it out.\n\nWait, but Cube C's left face is one of Star, Square, Heart.\n\nSimilarly, Cube B's right face must be one of Star, Triangle, Heart, Cross.\n\nBut Cube C's left face must be one of Star, Square, Heart.\n\nSo, since Cube B's right face is adjacent to Cube C's left face, and both are on the same side (right of B, left of C), they must be the same pattern.\n\nWait, but each cube has all six patterns, so the right face of Cube B must be one of the patterns that is also on Cube C's left face.\n\nBut Cube C's left face is one of Star, Square, Heart.\n\nSo, Cube B's right face must be one of these three.\n\nBut Cube B's right face is also one of Star, Triangle, Heart, Cross.\n\nTherefore, the overlap between these two sets is Star, Heart.\n\nSo, Cube B's right face must be either Star or Heart, because those are common between the two.\n\nTherefore, Cube B's right face is either Star or Heart.\n\nSimilarly, Cube C's left face is either Star, Square, or Heart.\n\nSo, if Cube B's right face is Star, then Cube C's left face must be Star.\n\nIf Cube B's right face is Heart, then Cube C's left face must be Heart.\n\nBut we also know that each cube must have all six patterns, so let's see.\n\nCube B's right face is either Star or Heart.\n\nCase 1: Cube B's right face is Star.\n\nThen, Cube C's left face is Star.\n\nSo, Cube C's left face is Star, which is one of the remaining patterns.\n\nThen, Cube C's remaining faces (back and bottom) would be Square and Heart.\n\nSimilarly, Cube B's right face is Star, so Cube B's remaining faces (left, back, bottom) would be Triangle, Heart, Cross.\n\nBut wait, Cube B's top is Square, front is Circle, right is Star. So, the remaining are Triangle, Heart, Cross.\n\nSimilarly, Cube A's right face would be one of Circle, Triangle, Square, Cross.\n\nBut we need to make sure that each cube has all six patterns.\n\nWait, perhaps I should try to assign the patterns step by step.\n\nLet me try Case 1: Cube B's right face is Star.\n\nSo, Cube B:\n\n- Front: Circle\n\n- Top: Square\n\n- Right: Star\n\nTherefore, Cube B's remaining faces (left, back, bottom) must be Triangle, Heart, Cross.\n\nSo, Cube B's left, back, bottom are Triangle, Heart, Cross in some order.\n\nSimilarly, Cube C:\n\n- Front: Triangle\n\n- Top: Cross\n\n- Right: Circle\n\n- Left: Star (since Cube B's right is Star)\n\nTherefore, Cube C's left face is Star, and the remaining faces (back and bottom) are Square and Heart.\n\nSo, Cube C's back and bottom are Square and Heart in some order.\n\nNow, let's look at Cube A.\n\nCube A:\n\n- Front: Star\n\n- Top: Heart\n\n- Right: ?\n\n- Left: ?\n\n- Back: ?\n\n- Bottom: ?\n\nCube A's remaining faces (right, left, back, bottom) must be Circle, Triangle, Square, Cross.\n\nBut we need to figure out how these are arranged.\n\nSince Cube A is the leftmost cube, its left face is the leftmost face, and its right face is adjacent to Cube B's left face.\n\nBut Cube B's left face is one of Triangle, Heart, Cross.\n\nWait, no, Cube B's left face is one of Triangle, Heart, Cross, but we don't know which yet.\n\nWait, in Case 1, Cube B's left face is either Triangle, Heart, or Cross.\n\nBut Cube A's right face is adjacent to Cube B's left face.\n\nBut Cube A's right face is one of Circle, Triangle, Square, Cross.\n\nSo, Cube A's right face must be equal to Cube B's left face.\n\nTherefore, Cube A's right face is equal to Cube B's left face.\n\nBut Cube B's left face is one of Triangle, Heart, Cross.\n\nSo, Cube A's right face must be one of these.\n\nTherefore, Cube A's right face is either Triangle, Heart, or Cross.\n\nBut Cube A's remaining faces (right, left, back, bottom) are Circle, Triangle, Square, Cross.\n\nSo, Cube A's right face can be Triangle, Heart, or Cross, but Heart is not among Cube A's remaining patterns because Cube A's top is Heart, and each cube must have all six patterns, so Heart is already on top, so it cannot be on any other face.\n\nWait, no, each cube must have all six patterns, so Heart is on Cube A's top, so it must also be on the other faces? No, wait, each cube has each pattern once on each face.\n\nWait, no, each cube has six different patterns on its six faces, each pattern once. So, if Cube A's top is Heart, then Heart is on the top face, and it must be on only one face of Cube A. So, Cube A cannot have Heart on any other face.\n\nSimilarly, Cube A's front is Star, so Star is only on front face.\n\nTherefore, Cube A's remaining faces (right, left, back, bottom) must be Circle, Triangle, Square, Cross.\n\nTherefore, Cube A's right face cannot be Heart because Heart is already on top.\n\nSo, in Case 1, where Cube B's right face is Star, then Cube B's left face is Star, which would mean Cube A's right face is Star. But Cube A's right face cannot be Star because Cube A's front is Star, and each cube has each pattern once. So, Cube A cannot have Star on two faces.\n\nTherefore, this is a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, Case 1 is invalid.\n\nTherefore, Cube B's right face cannot be Star.\n\nSo, moving to Case 2: Cube B's right face is Heart.\n\nTherefore, Cube B's right face is Heart.\n\nThus, Cube C's left face must be Heart (since Cube B's right face is adjacent to Cube C's left face, and they must be the same).\n\nTherefore, Cube C's left face is Heart.\n\nSo, Cube C:\n\n- Front: Triangle\n\n- Top: Cross\n\n- Right: Circle\n\n- Left: Heart\n\nTherefore, Cube C's"
