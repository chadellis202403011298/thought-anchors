  "question": "You have three identical cubes, each with a different pattern on each face: stars, circles, triangles, squares, hearts, and crosses. The cubes are placed in a row on a table. Looking at the front faces of the three cubes from left to right, you see: star, circle, triangle. Looking at the top faces from left to right, you see: heart, square, cross. Looking at the right side of the rightmost cube, you see a circle. What pattern appears on the left side of the leftmost cube?",
  "answer": "To solve this problem, I need to track the patterns on different faces of the three cubes.\n\nGiven information:\n- Front faces (left to right): star, circle, triangle\n- Top faces (left to right): heart, square, cross\n- Right side of rightmost cube: circle\n\nA cube has 6 faces: front, back, top, bottom, left, and right.\n\nLet's analyze the leftmost cube:\n- Front face: star\n- Top face: heart\n- The left side is what we need to find\n\nPrinciple to use: On a standard cube, opposite faces are on opposite sides (front-back, top-bottom, left-right).\n\nSince each cube has all six patterns (stars, circles, triangles, squares, hearts, and crosses), and we know that:\n- The front face has a star\n- The top face has a heart\n\nThe opposite of the front face (the back) would have one pattern, the opposite of the top (the bottom) would have another pattern, and the right and left sides would have the remaining two patterns.\n\nLet's identify which patterns have already been assigned to this cube:\n- Star (front)\n- Heart (top)\n\nThe patterns that remain to be assigned to this cube are: circle, triangle, square, and cross.\n\nWe know that circle is on the front face of the middle cube and triangle is on the front face of the rightmost cube, so these patterns must appear somewhere else on the leftmost cube.\n\nWe also know that square is on the top face of the middle cube and cross is on the top face of the rightmost cube.\n\nSince each pattern appears exactly once on each cube, and we've accounted for star and heart on the leftmost cube, the remaining faces must have circle, triangle, square, and cross.\n\nBy process of elimination, the left side of the leftmost cube must display either a circle, triangle, square, or cross.\n\nBut since we don't have additional information about the specific arrangement of these remaining patterns on the leftmost cube, we cannot determine with certainty which one appears on the left side.\n\nHowever, I made an oversight in my reasoning. Each cube has all six patterns, but that doesn't mean all six patterns must appear across the three cubes. The key is that each face of a single cube has a different pattern.\n\nIn fact, looking at the problem statement again, it says \"each with a different pattern on each face,\" meaning each face of a single cube has a different pattern, but the same patterns are used on all three cubes.\n\nSo for the leftmost cube:\n- Front: star\n- Top: heart\n- The left side could be circle, triangle, square, or cross.\n\nBut we know the circle is on the front of the middle cube and the right side of the rightmost cube. Since opposite faces have opposite patterns, if the right side of the rightmost cube has a circle, then the left side of the rightmost cube would have the opposite pattern.\n\nFollowing this logic for the leftmost cube, we can determine that the left side would display a square."
