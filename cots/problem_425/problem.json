  "question": "Three orthographic views (front, top, and right side) of a simple 3D object made of cubes are shown below:\n\nFront view:\n\u25a0 \u25a0\n\u25a0 \u25a1\n\nTop view:\n\u25a0 \u25a0\n\u25a0 \u25a0\n\nRight side view:\n\u25a0 \u25a0\n\u25a1 \u25a1\n\nWhere '\u25a0' represents a solid cube and '\u25a1' represents an empty space. How many cubes are used to create this 3D object?",
  "answer": "To solve this problem, I need to analyze the three orthographic views and determine the 3D structure.\n\nStep 1: Understand what each view represents.\n- Front view shows what you see looking directly at the object from the front.\n- Top view shows what you see looking down at the object from above.\n- Right side view shows what you see looking at the object from its right side.\n\nStep 2: Set up a coordinate system to track positions.\nImagine a 2\u00d72\u00d72 grid with positions (row, column, depth).\n\nStep 3: Analyze the front view (showing row and column positions).\nFront view:\n\u25a0 \u25a0 (row 1, columns 1 and 2)\n\u25a0 \u25a1 (row 2, column 1 has a cube, column 2 is empty)\n\nStep 4: Analyze the top view (showing column and depth positions).\nTop view:\n\u25a0 \u25a0 (column 1, depths 1 and 2)\n\u25a0 \u25a0 (column 2, depths 1 and 2)\nThis indicates cubes exist in all four column-depth positions when viewed from above.\n\nStep 5: Analyze the right side view (showing row and depth positions).\nRight side view:\n\u25a0 \u25a0 (row 1, depths 1 and 2)\n\u25a1 \u25a1 (row 2, no cubes in either depth)\n\nStep 6: Cross-reference the information.\n- Position (1,1,1): Front view shows a cube at (1,1), top view shows a cube at (1,1), right side view shows a cube at (1,1). Therefore, there is a cube here.\n- Position (1,1,2): Front view shows a cube at (1,1), top view shows a cube at (1,2), right side view shows a cube at (1,2). Therefore, there is a cube here.\n- Position (1,2,1): Front view shows a cube at (1,2), top view shows a cube at (2,1), right side view doesn't show a cube at (1,1). This is a contradiction, so there can't be a cube here.\n- Position (1,2,2): Front view shows a cube at (1,2), top view shows a cube at (2,2), right side view shows a cube at (1,2). Therefore, there is a cube here.\n- Position (2,1,1): Front view shows a cube at (2,1), top view shows a cube at (1,1), right side view doesn't show a cube at (2,1). This is a contradiction, so there can't be a cube here.\n- Position (2,1,2): Front view shows a cube at (2,1), top view shows a cube at (1,2), right side view doesn't show a cube at (2,2). This is a contradiction, so there can't be a cube here.\n- Position (2,2,1): Front view doesn't show a cube at (2,2), so there is no cube here.\n- Position (2,2,2): Front view doesn't show a cube at (2,2), so there is no cube here.\n\nThe apparent contradictions can be resolved by recognizing that the object isn't a full 2\u00d72\u00d72 grid. The front view shows a cube at (2,1), but the right side view shows no cubes in row 2. This means there must be a cube at (2,1,1) only, and it doesn't extend to depth 2.\n\nCounting the confirmed cube positions: (1,1,1), (1,1,2), (1,2,2), and (2,1,1).\n\nTherefore, the 3D object consists of 4 cubes."
