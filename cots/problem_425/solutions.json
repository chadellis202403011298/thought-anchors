How many cubes are used to create this 3D object? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I've got this problem here with three orthographic views of a 3D object made up of cubes. I need to figure out how many cubes are used to create this object. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me visualize the views given:\n\n**Front View:**\n```\n\u25a0 \u25a0\n\u25a0 \u25a1\n```\nSo, from the front, it's a 2x2 grid. The bottom row has two cubes, and the top row has two cubes with one missing on the right side.\n\n**Top View:**\n```\n\u25a0 \u25a0\n\u25a0 \u25a0\n```\nFrom the top, it's also a 2x2 grid. All four positions have cubes.\n\n**Right Side View:**\n```\n\u25a0 \u25a0\n\u25a1 \u25a1\n```\nFrom the right, the top row has two cubes, and the bottom row has two empty spaces.\n\nOkay, so I need to interpret these views and reconstruct the 3D object. Let me think about how orthographic views work. Each view shows the object from a specific direction: front, top, and right side. The cubes are represented by '\u25a0' and empty spaces by '\u25a1'.\n\nI'll start by analyzing each view separately and then try to combine the information.\n\n**Front View Analysis:**\n```\n\u25a0 \u25a0\n\u25a0 \u25a1\n```\nThis suggests that from the front, the object has two cubes in the first row and two cubes in the second row, but the top right cube is missing. So, in 3D terms, the front face has cubes at positions (Front-Left, Front-Right, Front-Back-Left, Front-Back-Right), but the Front-Back-Right is missing.\n\nWait, actually, in orthographic views, each position corresponds to a specific depth. So, maybe it's better to think in terms of columns.\n\nLet me assign coordinates to better visualize this.\n\nLet's assume that the front view is along the z-axis, the top view is along the x-axis, and the right side view is along the y-axis.\n\nSo, in the front view, the x-axis is horizontal (left-right), and the z-axis is vertical (front-back).\n\nIn the top view, the y-axis is horizontal (front-back), and the z-axis is vertical.\n\nIn the right side view, the y-axis is vertical (up-down), and the x-axis is horizontal.\n\nThis might get a bit confusing, but let's try to map the views.\n\nLet me consider the 3D grid with x, y, z coordinates where x is right-left, y is front-back, and z is up-down.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to think in terms of layers.\n\nLet me try to reconstruct the object layer by layer.\n\n**Front View:**\n```\n\u25a0 \u25a0\n\u25a0 \u25a1\n```\nAssuming the front view is looking along the z-axis, the first row (z=1) has two cubes: (x=1, z=1) and (x=2, z=1). The second row (z=2) has two cubes: (x=1, z=2) and (x=2, z=2), but the cube at (x=2, z=2) is missing.\n\nWait, no, in the front view, the second row is the back row. So, actually, the front view shows the front face, which is the z=1 layer, and the back face, which is the z=2 layer.\n\nBut in the front view, the first row is the front row, and the second row is the back row.\n\nSo, in the front view:\n\n- Front row (z=1): Both cubes are present: (x=1, z=1) and (x=2, z=1).\n- Back row (z=2): Both cubes are present: (x=1, z=2) and (x=2, z=2), but the cube at (x=2, z=2) is missing. Wait, no, in the front view, the second row is (x=1, z=2) and (x=2, z=2). But in the given front view, the second row is \u25a0 \u25a1. So, (x=1, z=2) is present, but (x=2, z=2) is missing.\n\nSo, the front view tells us that at z=1, x=1 and x=2 are present. At z=2, x=1 is present, but x=2 is missing.\n\n**Top View:**\n```\n\u25a0 \u25a0\n\u25a0 \u25a0\n```\nThe top view is looking along the x-axis, so the y-axis is horizontal (front-back), and z is vertical.\n\nIn the top view, both rows (y=1 and y=2) have two cubes each.\n\nSo, at y=1, both (z=1 and z=2) are present. Similarly, at y=2, both (z=1 and z=2) are present.\n\nSo, the top view indicates that for each y (front-back position), there are cubes in both z layers (front and back).\n\n**Right Side View:**\n```\n\u25a0 \u25a0\n\u25a1 \u25a1\n```\nThe right side view is looking along the y-axis, so the x-axis is horizontal (left-right), and z is vertical.\n\nIn the right side view, the first row (x=1) has two cubes: (y=1, z=1) and (y=1, z=2). The second row (x=2) has two empty spaces: (y=2, z=1) and (y=2, z=2).\n\nSo, the right side view tells us that at x=1, both y positions have cubes in both z layers. At x=2, both y positions have empty spaces in both z layers.\n\nNow, let's try to combine this information.\n\nFrom the front view:\n\n- At z=1 (front layer), x=1 and x=2 have cubes.\n- At z=2 (back layer), x=1 has a cube, x=2 does not.\n\nFrom the top view:\n\n- At y=1 (front position), z=1 and z=2 have cubes.\n- At y=2 (back position), z=1 and z=2 have cubes.\n\nFrom the right side view:\n\n- At x=1 (left side), y=1 and y=2 have cubes in both z layers.\n- At x=2 (right side), y=1 and y=2 have no cubes in both z layers.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So, at x=2, there are no cubes in either y position or z layer.\n\nSo, the object must be present only at x=1.\n\nBut let's check.\n\nFrom the front view, at z=1, x=1 and x=2 have cubes. But from the right side view, at x=2, both y positions have empty spaces in both z layers. So, that suggests that at x=2, there are no cubes in any y or z position.\n\nTherefore, the only cubes are at x=1, y=1, z=1 and x=1, y=1, z=2; x=1, y=2, z=1 and x=1, y=2, z=2.\n\nBut let's check the front view again. At z=1, x=1 and x=2 have cubes, but from the right side view, at x=2, y=1 and y=2 have no cubes. So, the cube at x=2, y=1, z=1 must be missing, which contradicts the front view.\n\nWait, that's a problem. The front view shows that at z=1, x=1 and x=2 have cubes, but the right side view shows that at x=2, y=1 and y=2 have no cubes. So, how can x=2 have a cube in the front view if the right side view shows no cube there?\n\nThis suggests that the front view might be misleading, or perhaps I'm misinterpreting the views.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the right side view is showing that at x=2, both y positions have empty spaces, meaning that the cube at x=2, y=1, z=1 is missing. But the front view shows that at z=1, x=2 is present. So, that would mean that at x=2, y=1, z=1 is empty, but the front view shows that at z=1, x=2 is present. Therefore, perhaps the cube at x=2, y=1, z=1 is actually not present, but the front view shows it as present. That can't be.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing up the axes. Let me clarify the axes:\n\n- Front view: x is left-right, z is front-back.\n- Top view: y is front-back, z is vertical.\n- Right side view: x is left-right, y is front-back, but the view is along the y-axis, so x is horizontal, and z is vertical.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to define the 3D coordinates as (x, y, z), where:\n\n- x: right-left\n- y: front-back\n- z: up-down\n\nBut in orthographic views:\n\n- Front view: looking along the positive z-axis, so x and y are projected onto the view plane.\n- Top view: looking along the positive x-axis, so y and z are projected.\n- Right side view: looking along the positive y-axis, so x and z are projected.\n\nSo, the front view shows x and y coordinates, with z as depth.\n\nThe top view shows y and z, with x as depth.\n\nThe right side view shows x and z, with y as depth.\n\nSo, each view projects two axes onto the view plane, with the third axis as depth.\n\nGiven that, let's try to map the positions.\n\n**Front View (x, y):**\n```\n\u25a0 \u25a0\n\u25a0 \u25a1\n```\nSo, at z=1 (front layer), x=1 and x=2 are present.\n\nAt z=2 (back layer), x=1 is present, x=2 is missing.\n\n**Top View (y, z):**\n```\n\u25a0 \u25a0\n\u25a0 \u25a0\n```\nAt y=1, z=1 and z=2 are present.\n\nAt y=2, z=1 and z=2 are present.\n\n**Right Side View (x, z):**\n```\n\u25a0 \u25a0\n\u25a1 \u25a1\n```\nAt x=1, y=1 and y=2 are present in both z layers.\n\nAt x=2, both y positions have no cubes in either z layer.\n\nSo, now, let's try to reconcile these.\n\nFrom the front view, at z=1, x=1 and x=2 have cubes.\n\nFrom the right side view, at x=2, both y positions have no cubes in either z layer. Therefore, the cubes at x=2, y=1, z=1 and x=2, y=2, z=1 must be missing.\n\nBut the front view shows that at z=1, x=2 has a cube. So, there's a contradiction.\n\nWait, perhaps the right side view is showing that at x=2, both y positions have no cubes in either z layer, which would mean that x=2 is entirely empty. But the front view shows that at z=1, x=2 has a cube. Therefore, the only way this makes sense is if the cube at x=2, y=1, z=1 is actually not present, but the front view is showing it as present.\n\nThis suggests that the front view might be misleading, or perhaps I'm misinterpreting the views.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the right side view is showing that at x=2, both y positions have no cubes in either z layer, meaning that x=2 is entirely empty. But the front view shows that at z=1, x=2 has a cube, which would be at x=2, y=1, z=1. Therefore, there's a conflict.\n\nThis suggests that perhaps the front view is not showing the entire object, but only a part of it, or perhaps the views are not to scale.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the object is such that at x=2, y=1, z=1 is missing, but the front view is showing it as present. That can't be, unless the front view is an orthographic projection that might not show depth accurately.\n\nWait, perhaps the front view is showing x and z, but in reality, the cube at x=2, y=1, z=1 is missing because from the right side view, x=2 is empty. So, the front view is showing x=2 as present, but the right side view shows x=2 as empty, meaning that the cube at x=2, y=1, z=1 is missing, but the front view might be showing a cube that is actually not there because it's behind another cube.\n\nWait, no, in orthographic projection, each view shows the maximum extent in that direction. So, if at x=2, y=1, z=1 is missing, the front view would not show a cube there.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to reconstruct the 3D object step by step.\n\nLet me consider that each view shows the object from a certain direction, and the cubes are present or absent at specific positions.\n\nLet me create a 3D grid with x, y, z coordinates, where:\n\n- x: left to right (1,2)\n- y: front to back (1,2)\n- z: bottom to top (1,2)\n\nEach cube is either present (\u25a0) or absent (\u25a1) at each position.\n\nFrom the front view (x, y):\n\n- At z=1 (front layer):\n  - x=1, y=1: present\n  - x=2, y=1: present\n  - x=1, y=2: present\n  - x=2, y=2: missing\n\n- At z=2 (back layer):\n  - x=1, y=1: present\n  - x=2, y=1: missing\n  - x=1, y=2: present\n  - x=2, y=2: missing\n\nFrom the top view (y, z):\n\n- At x=1:\n  - y=1, z=1: present\n  - y=1, z=2: present\n  - y=2, z=1: present\n  - y=2, z=2: present\n\n- At x=2:\n  - y=1, z=1: present\n  - y=1, z=2: present\n  - y=2, z=1: present\n  - y=2, z=2: present\n\nWait, but the front view at z=1 shows x=2, y=2 as missing, which would mean that at x=2, y=2, z=1 is missing.\n\nSimilarly, at z=2, x=2, y=1 and y=2 are missing.\n\nBut the top view shows that at x=2, all positions are present. So, that's a contradiction.\n\nWait, that can't be. The top view shows that at x=2, all y and z positions are present, but the front view shows that at z=1, x=2, y=2 is missing, and at z=2, x=2, y=1 and y=2 are missing.\n\nSo, this suggests that the top view is showing that at x=2, all y and z positions are present, but the front and right side views are showing that x=2 is missing in certain positions.\n\nThis is confusing. Perhaps the top view is not showing the entire object, but only the front and back positions.\n\nWait, no, the top view should show the entire extent in the top-down direction, so it should show all y and z positions.\n\nBut if the top view shows that at x=2, all y and z positions are present, but the front view shows that at z=1, x=2, y=2 is missing, that would mean that the cube at x=2, y=2, z=1 is missing, but the top view shows it as present.\n\nThis suggests that the front view might be showing a projection where the cube is hidden behind another cube.\n\nWait, but in orthographic projection, the front view shows the maximum extent in the front-back direction, so if a cube is present at x=2, y=2, z=1, it should be visible in the front view if it's in front of other cubes.\n\nBut according to the front view, at z=1, x=2, y=2 is missing. So, perhaps that cube is not present.\n\nBut the top view shows that at x=2, y=2, z=1 is present. So, that suggests that the cube is present, but the front view does not show it, which would mean that it's behind another cube at x=2, y=2, z=1. But wait, in orthographic projection, the front view shows all cubes in the front layer (z=1) that are in the x and y positions. If the cube is at x=2, y=2, z=1, it should be visible unless it's hidden by another cube in front of it.\n\nBut since z=1 is the front layer, there are no cubes in front of it. So, it should be visible.\n\nBut the front view shows that at x=2, y=2, z=1 is missing. So, perhaps it's not present.\n\nBut the top view shows that at x=2, y=2, z=1 is present. So, there's a conflict.\n\nThis suggests that the object might have a cube at x=2, y=2, z=1, but it's not visible in the front view, which would mean that it's behind another cube, but since z=1 is the front layer, that's impossible.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the cube at x=2, y=2, z=1 is not present, and the top view is showing it as present, but that's incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the top view is not showing the entire object, but only the front and back positions.\n\nWait, no, the top view should show all y and z positions.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe I should try to draw it out.\n\nLet me create a 3D grid with x, y, z coordinates from 1 to 2 each.\n\nInitialize all positions as empty (\u25a1).\n\nNow, let's fill in the cubes based on the views.\n\nFrom the front view (x, y):\n\n- At z=1 (front layer):\n  - x=1, y=1: present\n  - x=2, y=1: present\n  - x=1, y=2: present\n  - x=2, y=2: missing\n\n- At z=2 (back layer):\n  - x=1, y=1: present\n  - x=2, y=1: missing\n  - x=1, y=2: present\n  - x="

End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: Three orthographic views (front, top, and right side) of a simple 3D object made of cubes are shown below:\n\nFront view:\n\u25a0 \u25a0\n\u25a0 \u25a1\n\nTop view:\n\u25a0 \u25a0\n\u25a0 \u25a0\n\nRight side view:\n\u25a0 \u25a0\n\u25a1 \u25a1\n\nWhere '\u25a0' represents a solid cube and '\u25a1' represents an empty space. How many cubes are used to create this 3D object? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I've got this problem here about figuring out how many cubes are used to make a 3D object based on its orthographic views. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I see there are three views: front, top, and right side. Each view shows a 2x2 grid of cubes, some filled (\u25a0) and some empty (\u25a1). I remember that orthographic views show the maximum extent of the object in each of the three dimensions\u2014length, width, and height.\n\nLet me label the views for clarity:\n\n1. **Front View:**\n   ```\n   \u25a0 \u25a0\n   \u25a0 \u25a1\n   ```\n   So, from the front, the object has two cubes in the first row and one cube in the second row, but the third position in the second row is empty.\n\n2. **Top View:**\n   ```\n   \u25a0 \u25a0\n   \u25a0 \u25a0\n   ```\n   From above, the object completely fills a 2x2 area.\n\n3. **Right Side View:**\n   ```\n   \u25a0 \u25a0\n   \u25a1 \u25a1\n   ```\n   From the right side, the first row has two cubes, but the second row has two empty spaces.\n\nNow, I need to visualize or sketch what this object might look like in 3D. Since all three views are 2x2, it's likely a 2x2x2 cube or something similar, but the arrangement of filled and empty spaces suggests it's not solid.\n\nLet me start by considering the front view. It shows two cubes in the first row and one cube in the second row on the right. So, if I imagine looking at it from the front, it's like there's a base layer with two cubes and a second layer with one cube sticking out on the right.\n\nThe top view shows that from above, it's a full 2x2 square. That means, in the top layer, both positions are filled. So, the second cube in the front view's second row must be connected to the top layer.\n\nNow, the right side view shows two cubes in the first row and two empty spaces in the second row. This suggests that from the right side, the object doesn't extend upward in the second row. But the front view indicates there is a cube in the second row on the right, so that must align with the top view.\n\nLet me try to map this out.\n\nFrom the front:\n- First row (front layer): two cubes, left and middle.\n- Second row (back layer): one cube on the right.\n\nFrom the top:\n- Both rows in the top layer are filled.\n\nFrom the right side:\n- First row: two cubes.\n- Second row: two empty spaces.\n\nWait, that doesn't quite add up. If the front view's second row has one cube on the right, and the top view shows both top positions are filled, then that cube must be in the top layer. But the right side view shows two empty spaces in the second row, which might mean that the second layer doesn't extend to the right side.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to think in terms of layers. Let's consider the front layer, middle layer, and back layer.\n\n**Front Layer (z=1):**\n- x=1, y=1: cube\n- x=2, y=1: cube\n- x=1, y=2: empty\n- x=2, y=2: empty\n\nWait, no. The front view is 2x2, so perhaps it's two columns and two rows.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to assign coordinates. Let me assume that in the front view, x is horizontal (left-right) and y is vertical (up-down). So, front view:\n\n- x=1, y=1: cube\n- x=2, y=1: cube\n- x=1, y=2: empty\n- x=2, y=2: empty\n\nBut that can't be right because the front view shows two cubes in the first row and one in the second row. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up axes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps front view is x (left-right) and z (front-back), and top view is x (left-right) and y (up-down). Right side view is y (up-down) and z (front-back).\n\nLet me try to define the axes:\n\n- Front view (x-z plane):\n  - x=1, z=1: cube\n  - x=2, z=1: cube\n  - x=1, z=2: empty\n  - x=2, z=2: empty\n\n- Top view (x-y plane):\n  - x=1, y=1: cube\n  - x=2, y=1: cube\n  - x=1, y=2: cube\n  - x=2, y=2: cube\n\n- Right side view (y-z plane):\n  - y=1, z=1: cube\n  - y=2, z=1: cube\n  - y=1, z=2: empty\n  - y=2, z=2: empty\n\nWait, that might make sense. Let me see.\n\nFrom the front view, x=1, z=1 and x=2, z=1 are cubes. x=1, z=2 and x=2, z=2 are empty. So, in the front layer (z=1), it's a 2x2 square, but in the back layer (z=2), it's empty.\n\nBut the top view shows that in the top layer (y=1 and y=2), both x=1 and x=2 are cubes. So, the top layer is completely filled.\n\nThe right side view (y-z plane) shows that for y=1, z=1 and y=2, z=1 are cubes, but y=1, z=2 and y=2, z=2 are empty. So, in the right side, the front layer (z=1) is filled, but the back layer (z=2) is empty.\n\nWait, but the front view shows that in z=2, x=1 and x=2 are empty. So, that matches.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the object is 2 units tall, 2 units wide, and 2 units deep.\n\nBut let's check for overlaps. Since the top view is completely filled, that suggests that in both y=1 and y=2, x=1 and x=2 are cubes.\n\nSimilarly, the front view shows that in z=1, x=1 and x=2 are cubes, but in z=2, they are empty.\n\nThe right side view shows that in y=1 and y=2, z=1 are cubes, but z=2 are empty.\n\nWait, but the front view's z=2 is empty, which aligns with the right side view's z=2 being empty.\n\nSo, the object is a 2x2x2 cube, but with the back layer (z=2) empty.\n\nBut wait, that can't be right because the top view shows both y=1 and y=2 layers as filled, which would imply that the object is 2 units tall, but if the back layer is empty, then the height is only 1 unit.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me try again.\n\nFrom the front view, z=1 has cubes at x=1, y=1 and x=2, y=1, and z=2 has empty at x=1, y=2 and x=2, y=2.\n\nFrom the top view, y=1 has cubes at x=1, y=1 and x=2, y=1, and y=2 has cubes at x=1, y=2 and x=2, y=2.\n\nFrom the right side view, z=1 has cubes at y=1, z=1 and y=2, z=1, and z=2 has empty.\n\nWait, that suggests that in the right side view, z=1 is filled, but z=2 is empty.\n\nSo, the object has:\n\n- At z=1 (front layer): cubes at (x=1,y=1,z=1), (x=2,y=1,z=1), (x=1,y=2,z=1), (x=2,y=2,z=1)\n\nWait, but front view shows that at z=2, x=1,y=2 and x=2,y=2 are empty, meaning that in the front view, z=2 is empty.\n\nBut the top view shows that y=2 is filled. So, the cube at y=2,z=1 must be present, but y=2,z=2 is empty.\n\nSimilarly, the right side view shows that at z=2, y=1 and y=2 are empty.\n\nSo, the object is only one layer thick in the z-direction. Wait, that can't be, because the top view shows two layers.\n\nWait, maybe I'm mixing up the axes. Let me try to redefine.\n\nLet me assume:\n\n- Front view: x (left-right), y (front-back)\n- Top view: x (left-right), z (up-down)\n- Right side view: y (left-right), z (front-back)\n\nSo, front view (x-y plane):\n\n- x=1, y=1: cube\n- x=2, y=1: cube\n- x=1, y=2: empty\n- x=2, y=2: empty\n\nTop view (x-z plane):\n\n- x=1, z=1: cube\n- x=2, z=1: cube\n- x=1, z=2: cube\n- x=2, z=2: cube\n\nRight side view (y-z plane):\n\n- y=1, z=1: cube\n- y=2, z=1: cube\n- y=1, z=2: empty\n- y=2, z=2: empty\n\nNow, let's see:\n\nFrom front view, at y=1, x=1 and x=2 are cubes, but at y=2, both x=1 and x=2 are empty.\n\nFrom top view, at z=1, x=1 and x=2 are cubes, and at z=2, x=1 and x=2 are cubes.\n\nFrom right side view, at z=1, y=1 and y=2 are cubes, but at z=2, both y=1 and y=2 are empty.\n\nSo, the object has:\n\n- At z=1: cubes at x=1,y=1,z=1; x=2,y=1,z=1; x=1,y=2,z=1; x=2,y=2,z=1\n\nWait, but front view at y=2 shows both x=1 and x=2 as empty, which would mean that at y=2,z=1, there should be no cubes. But top view shows that at z=1, both y=1 and y=2 have cubes.\n\nThis is conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps the front view is x (left-right) and z (front-back), while the top view is x (left-right) and y (front-back). Then, the right side view would be y (left-right) and z (front-back).\n\nLet me try that.\n\nFront view (x-z plane):\n\n- x=1, z=1: cube\n- x=2, z=1: cube\n- x=1, z=2: empty\n- x=2, z=2: empty\n\nTop view (x-y plane):\n\n- x=1, y=1: cube\n- x=2, y=1: cube\n- x=1, y=2: cube\n- x=2, y=2: cube\n\nRight side view (y-z plane):\n\n- y=1, z=1: cube\n- y=2, z=1: cube\n- y=1, z=2: empty\n- y=2, z=2: empty\n\nNow, from the front view, at z=1, x=1 and x=2 are cubes, but at z=2, both are empty.\n\nFrom the top view, at y=1 and y=2, x=1 and x=2 are cubes. So, the object is 2 units tall in the y-direction.\n\nFrom the right side view, at z=1, y=1 and y=2 are cubes, but at z=2, both are empty.\n\nSo, putting it together, the object has:\n\n- At z=1 (front layer): cubes at x=1,y=1,z=1; x=2,y=1,z=1; x=1,y=2,z=1; x=2,y=2,z=1\n\n- At z=2 (back layer): cubes at x=1,y=1,z=2; x=2,y=1,z=2; x=1,y=2,z=2; x=2,y=2,z=2\n\nBut wait, front view shows that at z=2, all are empty. So, that can't be. There's a contradiction here.\n\nWait, maybe the top view is y (up-down) and z (front-back). Let me try that.\n\nFront view (x-z plane):\n\n- x=1, z=1: cube\n- x=2, z=1: cube\n- x=1, z=2: empty\n- x=2, z=2: empty\n\nTop view (y-z plane):\n\n- y=1, z=1: cube\n- y=2, z=1: cube\n- y=1, z=2: cube\n- y=2, z=2: cube\n\nRight side view (x-z plane):\n\nWait, right side view is usually y (left-right) and z (front-back). So, perhaps:\n\nRight side view (y-z plane):\n\n- y=1, z=1: cube\n- y=2, z=1: cube\n- y=1, z=2: empty\n- y=2, z=2: empty\n\nNow, front view shows that at z=1, x=1 and x=2 are cubes, but at z=2, both are empty.\n\nTop view shows that at z=1 and z=2, y=1 and y=2 are cubes.\n\nRight side view shows that at z=1, y=1 and y=2 are cubes, but at z=2, both are empty.\n\nSo, the object has:\n\n- At z=1: cubes at x=1,y=1,z=1; x=2,y=1,z=1; x=1,y=2,z=1; x=2,y=2,z=1\n\n- At z=2: cubes at x=1,y=1,z=2; x=2,y=1,z=2; x=1,y=2,z=2; x=2,y=2,z=2\n\nBut front view shows that at z=2, both x=1 and x=2 are empty, which contradicts the top view showing that at z=2, y=1 and y=2 are cubes.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I need to approach it differently.\n\nLet me try to count the cubes based on the views.\n\nFrom the front view, there are 3 cubes: two in the first row and one in the second row.\n\nFrom the top view, there are 4 cubes: completely filled.\n\nFrom the right side view, there are 2 cubes in the first row and 0 in the second row.\n\nWait, that can't be. The right side view shows two cubes in the first row and two empty spaces in the second row, meaning 2 cubes in total.\n\nBut the front view shows 3 cubes, and the top view shows 4 cubes.\n\nThis suggests that the object has 4 cubes, but the front view only shows 3, and the right side view shows 2. That seems inconsistent.\n\nWait, perhaps the front view is not a 2x2 grid but a 2x2 arrangement, meaning that the actual object is larger.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the views are not all 2x2.\n\nWait, the front view shows:\n\n\u25a0 \u25a0\n\n\u25a0 \u25a1\n\nSo, that's three cubes in total.\n\nThe top view shows:\n\n\u25a0 \u25a0\n\n\u25a0 \u25a0\n\nWhich is four cubes.\n\nThe right side view shows:\n\n\u25a0 \u25a0\n\n\u25a1 \u25a1\n\nWhich is two cubes.\n\nBut that can't be, because the object can't have different numbers of cubes in different views.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscounting.

End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: Three orthographic views (front, top, and right side) of a simple 3D object made of cubes are shown below:\n\nFront view:\n\u25a0 \u25a0\n\u25a0 \u25a1\n\nTop view:\n\u25a0 \u25a0\n\u25a0 \u25a0\n\nRight side view:\n\u25a0 \u25a0\n\u25a1 \u25a1\n\nWhere '\u25a0' represents a solid cube and '\u25a1' represents an empty space. How many cubes are used to create this 3D object? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this problem here with three orthographic views of a 3D object made up of cubes. I need to figure out how many cubes are used to create this object. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what each view represents. The front view, top view, and right side view give me different perspectives of the 3D object. Each view shows which cubes are present along that particular axis. \n\nStarting with the front view:\n\nFront view:\n\u25a0 \u25a0\n\u25a0 \u25a1\n\nThis is a 2x2 grid. The first row has two solid cubes, and the second row has one solid cube and one empty space. So, from the front, I can see that there are 3 cubes stacked vertically in the first column and one empty space in the second column of the second row.\n\nNext, the top view:\n\nTop view:\n\u25a0 \u25a0\n\u25a0 \u25a0\n\nThis is also a 2x2 grid. Both rows have two solid cubes each. From the top, it looks like the entire top layer is filled with cubes. So, there are 4 cubes visible from the top.\n\nNow, the right side view:\n\nRight side view:\n\u25a0 \u25a0\n\u25a1 \u25a1\n\nThis is a 2x2 grid as well. The first column has two solid cubes, and the second column has two empty spaces. So, from the right side, only the first column is occupied, meaning there are 2 cubes visible from the right side.\n\nNow, I need to reconcile these views to figure out the total number of cubes used. Let me try to visualize or sketch a possible 3D structure that satisfies all three views.\n\nLet's consider the front view first. It shows 3 cubes vertically in the first column and one empty space in the second column. So, in the first column, from front to back, there are three cubes. In the second column, only the front cube is present, and the back is empty.\n\nFrom the top view, both columns in both rows are filled. So, the top layer is completely filled with 4 cubes. That means, in the top layer, both columns have cubes in both front and back positions.\n\nFrom the right side view, the first column has two cubes, and the second column has two empty spaces. So, in the right side view, only the first column is occupied from front to back, which suggests that in the first column, both the top and middle layers have cubes, but the bottom layer might be empty.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me clarify.\n\nIn the right side view, the first column has two cubes, meaning that in the rightmost column, from front to back, there are two cubes. So, the front cube and the back cube in that column are solid, and the second column is empty.\n\nBut from the front view, the first column has three cubes, so that suggests that the rightmost column has three cubes from front to back, but the right side view only shows two. That seems contradictory. Maybe I need to adjust my understanding.\n\nPerhaps the right side view is looking along the right side, meaning that it's showing the depth. So, if the right side view has two cubes in the first column, that would mean that in that column, there are two cubes along the depth, but the front view shows three. Hmm, that doesn't add up.\n\nWait, maybe I'm mixing up the axes. Let me define the axes properly. Let's assume that:\n\n- The front view is along the positive z-axis (looking towards us).\n- The top view is along the positive y-axis (looking from above).\n- The right side view is along the positive x-axis (looking from the right).\n\nSo, each view corresponds to a different axis:\n\n- Front view: x and y axes, with z going into the screen.\n- Top view: x and z axes, with y going into the screen.\n- Right side view: y and z axes, with x going into the screen.\n\nGiven that, let me try to map the views.\n\nFront view:\n\u25a0 \u25a0\n\u25a0 \u25a1\n\nThis shows the x and y positions. So, in the x=1, y=1 and x=1, y=2 positions, there are cubes. In x=2, y=1, there is a cube, but in x=2, y=2, there is an empty space.\n\nTop view:\n\u25a0 \u25a0\n\u25a0 \u25a0\n\nThis shows the x and z positions. So, in x=1, z=1 and x=1, z=2, there are cubes. Similarly, in x=2, z=1 and x=2, z=2, there are cubes.\n\nRight side view:\n\u25a0 \u25a0\n\u25a1 \u25a1\n\nThis shows the y and z positions. So, in y=1, z=1 and y=1, z=2, there are cubes. In y=2, z=1 and y=2, z=2, there are empty spaces.\n\nNow, let's try to reconstruct the 3D structure.\n\nFrom the front view, in x=1, both y=1 and y=2 have cubes. In x=2, y=1 has a cube, and y=2 is empty.\n\nFrom the top view, in x=1, both z=1 and z=2 have cubes. In x=2, both z=1 and z=2 have cubes.\n\nFrom the right side view, in y=1, both z=1 and z=2 have cubes. In y=2, both z=1 and z=2 are empty.\n\nSo, combining this information:\n\nFor x=1:\n- y=1: z=1 and z=2 (from top view)\n- y=2: z=1 and z=2 (from top view)\n\nBut from front view, x=1, y=1 and x=1, y=2 both have cubes. So, that's consistent.\n\nFor x=2:\n- y=1: z=1 and z=2 (from top view)\n- y=2: z=1 is empty (from front view)\n\nWait, but from front view, x=2, y=1 has a cube, but x=2, y=2 is empty.\n\nFrom top view, x=2, y=1 and x=2, y=2 both have cubes in both z=1 and z=2. But front view shows x=2, y=2 as empty. That seems contradictory.\n\nWait, no. From front view, x=2, y=2 is empty, meaning that in x=2, y=2, there is no cube. But from top view, x=2, y=2, z=1 and z=2 are cubes. That can't be, because if x=2, y=2, z=1 is a cube, then from front view, it should be visible as a cube in x=2, y=2, but it's empty. So, that suggests that the cube in x=2, y=2, z=1 is hidden from the front view, meaning that the front view is only showing cubes along the line of sight.\n\nWait, but in the front view, x=2, y=2 is empty, which suggests that in that position, there is no cube. So, perhaps in x=2, y=2, both z=1 and z=2 are empty. But from the top view, x=2, y=2, z=1 and z=2 have cubes. That's a conflict.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to reconsider.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the top view is showing that in x=2, y=2, there are cubes in both z=1 and z=2, but from the front view, x=2, y=2 is empty, which would mean that in that position, the cubes are behind other cubes, so they are not visible from the front.\n\nWait, but the problem says it's a simple 3D object made of cubes. So, it's a solid object, not hollow. Therefore, if from the top view, x=2, y=2 has cubes, then from the front view, x=2, y=2 should also show as cubes, unless they are blocked by other cubes.\n\nBut in the front view, x=2, y=2 is empty, which suggests that there is no cube there. So, perhaps the top view is misleading, or I'm misinterpreting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the top view is only showing the top layer, not the entire structure. But the problem states that it's a simple 3D object, so I think all layers are considered.\n\nWait, let's clarify. The front view shows the front face, which is the x-y plane at z=0. The top view shows the top face, which is the x-z plane at y=0. The right side view shows the right face, which is the y-z plane at x=0.\n\nGiven that, let's analyze each face:\n\nFront face (x-y plane at z=0):\n- (1,1) is solid\n- (1,2) is solid\n- (2,1) is solid\n- (2,2) is empty\n\nTop face (x-z plane at y=0):\n- (1,1) is solid\n- (1,2) is solid\n- (2,1) is solid\n- (2,2) is solid\n\nRight face (y-z plane at x=0):\n- (1,1) is solid\n- (1,2) is solid\n- (2,1) is empty\n- (2,2) is empty\n\nNow, from the front face, (2,2) is empty, so at position (x=2, y=2, z=0), there is no cube.\n\nFrom the top face, (2,2) is solid, so at position (x=2, y=0, z=2), there is a cube.\n\nFrom the right face, (2,1) and (2,2) are empty, so at positions (x=0, y=2, z=1) and (x=0, y=2, z=2), there are no cubes.\n\nNow, let's try to build the 3D structure.\n\nWe have to satisfy all three faces:\n\n1. Front face: (2,2,0) is empty.\n2. Top face: (2,2,2) is solid.\n3. Right face: (0,2,1) and (0,2,2) are empty.\n\nBut wait, the top face is at y=0, so (2,2,2) is at y=0, z=2. But the right face is at x=0, so (0,2,1) and (0,2,2) are at x=0, y=2, z=1 and z=2.\n\nSo, the top face shows that at (2,0,2), there is a cube, but the front face shows that at (2,2,0), there is no cube. That seems possible because they are different positions.\n\nSimilarly, the right face shows that at x=0, y=2, z=1 and z=2, there are no cubes, but the top face shows a cube at (2,0,2).\n\nNow, let's try to figure out the total number of cubes.\n\nFrom the front face, we have:\n\n- (1,1,0), (1,2,0), (2,1,0) are solid.\n- (2,2,0) is empty.\n\nFrom the top face, we have:\n\n- (1,1,2), (1,2,2), (2,1,2), (2,2,2) are solid.\n\nFrom the right face, we have:\n\n- (1,1,0), (1,2,0) are solid.\n- (2,1,0), (2,2,0) are empty.\n\nWait, no. The right face is at x=0, so the coordinates are (0, y, z). So, the right face shows:\n\n- (0,1,0), (0,1,1), (0,2,0), (0,2,1) are solid?\nWait, no. The right face is:\n\n\u25a0 \u25a0\n\u25a1 \u25a1\n\nSo, in the right face, the first row (y=1) has two cubes, and the second row (y=2) has two empty spaces.\n\nSo, at (0,1,0) and (0,1,1), there are cubes.\n\nAt (0,2,0) and (0,2,1), there are no cubes.\n\nNow, let's try to reconstruct the 3D structure.\n\nWe need to consider that each cube is defined by its (x, y, z) coordinates, where x, y, z are integers starting from 0.\n\nGiven the front face at z=0:\n\n- (0,1,0), (0,2,0), (1,1,0), (1,2,0), (2,1,0) are solid.\n\nWait, no. The front face is at z=0, but the problem didn't specify the origin. Let me assume that the origin is at the front-left-bottom corner.\n\nSo, front face (z=0):\n\n- x from 0 to 2, y from 0 to 2.\n\nFrom the front view:\n\n- (0,0,0): solid\n- (0,1,0): solid\n- (1,0,0): solid\n- (1,1,0): solid\n- (2,0,0): solid\n- (2,1,0): solid\n- (0,2,0): empty\n- (1,2,0): empty\n- (2,2,0): empty\n\nWait, but the front view shows:\n\nFront view:\n\u25a0 \u25a0\n\u25a0 \u25a1\n\nWhich corresponds to:\n\n(0,0,0), (0,1,0), (1,0,0), (1,1,0), (2,0,0), (2,1,0) as solid, and (0,2,0), (1,2,0), (2,2,0) as empty? No, that can't be because the front view is a 2x2 grid.\n\nWait, perhaps the front view is a 2x2 grid, meaning that x and y go from 0 to 1, and z=0.\n\nSo, front view:\n\n- (0,0,0): solid\n- (0,1,0): solid\n- (1,0,0): solid\n- (1,1,0): solid\n\nBut in the problem, the front view is:\n\nFront view:\n\u25a0 \u25a0\n\u25a0 \u25a1\n\nWhich is 2x2, so:\n\n- (0,0,0): solid\n- (0,1,0): solid\n- (1,0,0): solid\n- (1,1,0): solid\n\nWait, but in the problem, the front view is:\n\n\u25a0 \u25a0\n\u25a0 \u25a1\n\nWhich is:\n\n- First row: two solids\n- Second row: one solid, one empty\n\nSo, (0,0,0), (0,1,0), (1,0,0), (1,1,0). Among these, (0,0,0), (0,1,0), (1,0,0) are solid, and (1,1,0) is empty.\n\nWait, no. The front view is a 2x2 grid, so it's 2x2, meaning x from 0 to 1, y from 0 to 1, z=0.\n\nSo:\n\n- (0,0,0): solid\n- (0,1,0): solid\n- (1,0,0): solid\n- (1,1,0): empty\n\nSo, three solids in the front face.\n\nSimilarly, the top view is a 2x2 grid, x from 0 to 1, z from 0 to 1, y=0.\n\nSo:\n\n- (0,0,0): solid\n- (0,1,0): solid\n- (1,0,0): solid\n- (1,1,0): solid\n\nSo, all four positions in the top face are solid.\n\nThe right side view is a 2x2 grid, y from 0 to 1, z from 0 to 1, x=0.\n\nSo:\n\n- (0,0,0): solid\n- (0,0,1): solid\n- (0,1,0): solid\n- (0,1,1): solid\n\nWait, no. The right side view is:\n\n\u25a0 \u25a0\n\u25a1 \u25a1\n\nSo, first row (z=0): two solids\nSecond row (z=1): two empty spaces\n\nSo, at x=0, y=0, z=0: solid\nx=0, y=0, z=1: solid\nx=0, y=1, z=0: solid\nx=0, y=1, z=1: empty\n\nWait, no. The right side view is:\n\n\u25a0 \u25a0\n\u25a1 \u25a1\n\nSo, in terms of y and z:\n\n- (0,0,0): solid\n- (0,0,1): solid\n- (0,1,0): solid\n- (0,1,1): empty\n\nSo, at x=0, y=0, z=0 and z=1: solid\nAt x=0, y=1, z=0: solid\nAt x=0, y=1, z=1: empty\n\nNow, let's try to reconcile all these.\n\nFrom front view (z=0):\n\n- (0,0,0): solid\n- (0,1,0): solid\n- (1,0,0): solid\n- (1,1,0): empty\n\nFrom top view (y=0):\n\n- (0,0,0): solid\n- (0,1,0): solid\n- (1,0,0): solid\n- (1,1,0): solid\n\nFrom right side view (x=0):\n\n- (0,0,0): solid\n- (0,0,1): solid\n- (0,1,0): solid\n- (0,1,1): empty\n\nNow, let's try to figure out the 3D structure.\n\nFirst, note that from the front view, (1,1,0) is empty.

How many cubes are used to create this 3D object? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I've got this problem here about counting the number of cubes used in a 3D object based on its orthographic views. I need to figure out how many cubes are in total. Let me try to visualize this step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall what orthographic views are. There are three main ones: front view, top view, and right side view. Each of these shows a different face of the 3D object. The front view is like what you see when you look straight ahead, the top view is from above, and the right side view is from the side. Each view uses symbols: \u25a0 represents a solid cube, and \u25a1 represents an empty space.\n\nSo, the front view is:\n\n\u25a0 \u25a0\n\u25a0 \u25a1\n\nThat means, from the front, there are two cubes in the first row, two in the second row, but the last cube in the second row is empty. So, it's like a 2x2 square with one cube missing in the bottom right corner.\n\nThe top view is:\n\n\u25a0 \u25a0\n\u25a0 \u25a0\n\nThis means that from above, it's a full 2x2 square. So, all four positions are solid.\n\nThe right side view is:\n\n\u25a0 \u25a0\n\u25a1 \u25a1\n\nFrom the right side, the top two cubes are solid, but the bottom two are empty. So, it's like two cubes stacked vertically on the right side.\n\nNow, I need to figure out how these views correspond to the actual 3D object. Let me try to reconstruct it.\n\nStarting with the front view. If the front view has two cubes in the first row and two in the second, but the bottom right is empty, it's like a base of two cubes on the front face, and the second layer has two cubes but missing one. So, it's like a sort of step or a recess.\n\nThe top view being full 2x2 means that from above, everything is solid. So, wherever there's a \u25a0 in the front and right views, it must also be solid from above.\n\nThe right side view has two solid cubes on top and two empty ones below. So, on the right side, the top two cubes are solid, but the bottom two are not. This suggests that the object extends two cubes tall on the right, but not on the left.\n\nPutting this together, I imagine the object is two cubes tall, with a front face that has a sort of step: two cubes in front, and the second layer has two cubes but missing one. But from the top, it's a full 2x2, meaning the missing cube in the front second layer must be behind, covered by another cube.\n\nWait, that might not make sense. Let me think again.\n\nIf the front view has two cubes in the first row and two in the second, but the bottom right is empty, that suggests that the second layer's cube is behind the first layer's cube. But since the top view is full, the missing cube in the second layer must be present somewhere else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the object is two cubes wide and two cubes tall. Let's see.\n\nFrom the front view:\n\nRow 1: Two cubes\nRow 2: Two cubes, but the second cube is empty.\n\nSo, positions (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), and (2,2) exist, but (2,2) is empty.\n\nFrom the top view, all four positions are solid, meaning that (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), and (2,2) are all cubes.\n\nFrom the right side view, we have:\n\nTop row: Two cubes\nBottom row: Two empty spaces.\n\nSo, on the right side, only the top two cubes are present. That suggests that the object is two cubes tall, but only on the right side.\n\nWait, but from the front view, the second layer has two cubes, which would mean that the object is two cubes tall. However, the right side view only shows two cubes on the top, so maybe the object is only one cube tall on the right, but two on the left? That doesn't make sense because the front view shows two in each row.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the object is two cubes tall, and the right side view only shows the top two because the bottom two are behind and not visible from the right.\n\nBut since the top view is full, both the front and back must have cubes in the second layer.\n\nWait, maybe I need to sketch this out mentally.\n\nLet me consider the front, top, and right side views as different faces of a 3D object. Each view shows the cubes along the line of sight.\n\nSo, from the front, we see the front face, which has two cubes in the first row and two in the second, but the bottom right is missing. So, that suggests that the front face has a sort of indentation or step.\n\nFrom the top, it's a full 2x2, so the entire top face is solid.\n\nFrom the right side, we see two cubes on the top and two empty on the bottom. So, on the right face, only the top two are solid.\n\nThis suggests that the object is two cubes tall. The front face has two cubes in the first row and two in the second, but the second layer's cube under the front right is empty. However, since the top view is full, that empty cube must be present elsewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps the cube that's missing in the front second layer is present on the back side.\n\nSo, if from the front, the second layer's cube is empty, but from the top, it's solid, that cube must be behind, on the right side.\n\nSimilarly, the right side view shows two cubes on the top and two empty on the bottom, meaning that the object is two cubes tall on the right side, but not on the left.\n\nWait, that might not fit with the front view.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the object is two cubes wide and two cubes tall, with some cubes missing.\n\nLet me try to map out the positions.\n\nLet's consider the 3D coordinate system where x is right, y is forward, and z is up.\n\nFrom the front view, we're looking along the positive z-axis. So, the front view shows x and y.\n\nFrom the top view, we're looking along the positive y-axis, so it shows x and z.\n\nFrom the right side view, we're looking along the positive x-axis, so it shows y and z.\n\nEach position can be represented as (x, y, z).\n\nNow, from the front view:\n\nRow 1: (1,1,1)=\u25a0, (2,1,1)=\u25a0\n\nRow 2: (1,2,1)=\u25a0, (2,2,1)=\u25a1\n\nSo, in the first layer (z=1), we have four cubes: (1,1,1), (2,1,1), (1,2,1), (2,2,1). But (2,2,1)=\u25a1, so that cube is missing.\n\nFrom the top view:\n\nRow 1: (1,1,1)=\u25a0, (2,1,1)=\u25a0\n\nRow 2: (1,2,1)=\u25a0, (2,2,1)=\u25a0\n\nSo, both layers in the top view are solid, meaning that (2,2,1) must be present. But from the front view, it's empty. This suggests that there's a cube at (2,2,1) that's hidden from the front view but visible from the top. That can't be because the front view should show all cubes along the line of sight. So, perhaps the cube is at (2,2,2).\n\nWait, that makes more sense. So, in the front view, the cube at (2,2,2) is behind the cube at (2,2,1), so it's not visible from the front. But from the top view, looking along the y-axis, we can see both (2,2,1) and (2,2,2). However, in the front view, since we're looking along z, we only see the front layer (z=1). So, the cube at (2,2,2) is not visible from the front, but it's present and visible from the top and right side.\n\nSimilarly, the right side view shows:\n\nRow 1: (1,1,1)=\u25a0, (2,1,1)=\u25a0\n\nRow 2: (1,2,1)=\u25a1, (2,2,1)=\u25a1\n\nWait, no, the right side view is along the x-axis, so it shows y and z.\n\nSo, for the right side view (x=2), we see:\n\nAt y=1, z=1: \u25a0\n\nAt y=1, z=2: \u25a0\n\nAt y=2, z=1: \u25a1\n\nAt y=2, z=2: \u25a1\n\nSo, that suggests that at x=2, the cubes at (2,1,1) and (2,1,2) are present, but (2,2,1) and (2,2,2) are missing.\n\nBut from the top view, (2,2,1) and (2,2,2) are present, so they must be at x=1 or x=2.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to map this out properly.\n\nLet me define the 3D coordinates as follows:\n\nx: right (east), from 1 to 2\n\ny: forward (north), from 1 to 2\n\nz: up (vertical), from 1 to 2\n\nSo, the object is 2x2x2, but some cubes are missing.\n\nFrom the front view (looking along z):\n\nWe see x and y.\n\nFront view:\n\nRow 1 (z=1): (1,1,1)=\u25a0, (2,1,1)=\u25a0\n\nRow 2 (z=2): (1,2,1)=\u25a0, (2,2,1)=\u25a1\n\nSo, in the front layer (z=1), all four cubes are present except (2,2,1). Wait, no, (2,2,1) is shown as \u25a1, so it's missing.\n\nBut from the top view (looking along y):\n\nTop view:\n\nRow 1 (y=1): (1,1,1)=\u25a0, (2,1,1)=\u25a0\n\nRow 2 (y=2): (1,2,1)=\u25a0, (2,2,1)=\u25a0\n\nSo, both layers in the top view are solid, meaning that (2,2,1) is present. But from the front view, it's shown as \u25a1. This contradiction suggests that the cube at (2,2,1) is present but hidden from the front view because there's another cube in front of it. So, perhaps there's a cube at (2,2,2) that blocks the view of (2,2,1).\n\nSimilarly, from the right side view (looking along x):\n\nRight side view (x=2):\n\nRow 1 (y=1): (2,1,1)=\u25a0, (2,1,2)=\u25a0\n\nRow 2 (y=2): (2,2,1)=\u25a1, (2,2,2)=\u25a1\n\nSo, at x=2, the cubes at (2,1,1) and (2,1,2) are present, but (2,2,1) and (2,2,2) are missing.\n\nBut from the top view, (2,2,1) and (2,2,2) are present, so they must be at x=1 or x=2.\n\nWait, but from the front view, (2,2,1) is missing, but from the top view, it's present. So, the cube at (2,2,1) is present but hidden from the front view, meaning there's a cube in front of it at (2,2,2). Similarly, the cube at (2,2,2) is present but hidden from the right side view because it's behind.\n\nWait, no, from the right side view, (2,2,1) and (2,2,2) are missing, meaning that at x=2, y=2, both z=1 and z=2 are empty.\n\nBut from the top view, (2,2,1) and (2,2,2) are present, so they must be at x=1.\n\nSo, perhaps the cube at (2,2,1) is present but not at x=2, meaning it's at x=1. Similarly for z=2.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Let me try to list out all the cubes that must be present.\n\nFrom the front view:\n\n- (1,1,1)=\u25a0\n\n- (2,1,1)=\u25a0\n\n- (1,2,1)=\u25a0\n\n- (2,2,1)=\u25a1 (missing)\n\nFrom the top view:\n\n- (1,1,1)=\u25a0\n\n- (2,1,1)=\u25a0\n\n- (1,2,1)=\u25a0\n\n- (2,2,1)=\u25a0\n\n- (1,1,2)=\u25a0\n\n- (2,1,2)=\u25a0\n\n- (1,2,2)=\u25a0\n\n- (2,2,2)=\u25a0\n\nWait, no, the top view is 2x2, so only (1,1,1), (2,1,1), (1,2,1), (2,2,1) are shown as \u25a0. But from the front view, (2,2,1)=\u25a1, which contradicts. So, perhaps the cube at (2,2,1) is present but hidden from the front view because there's a cube behind it at (2,2,2).\n\nSimilarly, from the right side view:\n\n- (2,1,1)=\u25a0\n\n- (2,1,2)=\u25a0\n\n- (2,2,1)=\u25a1\n\n- (2,2,2)=\u25a1\n\nSo, at x=2, only (2,1,1) and (2,1,2) are present, but (2,2,1) and (2,2,2) are missing.\n\nBut from the top view, (2,2,1) and (2,2,2) are present, so they must be at x=1.\n\nSo, the cube at (2,2,1) is present but not at x=2, meaning it's at x=1. Similarly, (2,2,2) is present but not at x=2, meaning it's at x=1.\n\nTherefore, the object has cubes at:\n\n- x=1, y=1, z=1: \u25a0\n\n- x=2, y=1, z=1: \u25a0\n\n- x=1, y=2, z=1: \u25a0\n\n- x=2, y=2, z=1: \u25a1 (missing)\n\nBut from the top view, (2,2,1) is \u25a0, so it must be present. Hence, there's a cube at (2,2,1) that's visible from the top but hidden from the front. Therefore, there must be a cube at (2,2,2) blocking the view from the front.\n\nSimilarly, from the right side view, (2,2,1) and (2,2,2) are missing, meaning that at x=2, y=2, both z=1 and z=2 are empty. Therefore, the cubes at (2,2,1) and (2,2,2) are not present.\n\nBut from the top view, (2,2,1) and (2,2,2) are present, so they must be at x=1.\n\nSo, the cube at (2,2,1) is actually at (1,2,1), but that's already accounted for. Wait, no, (1,2,1) is present. So, perhaps the cube at (2,2,1) is missing, but the cube at (1,2,1) is present.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused again. Let me try to list all the cubes that must be present based on the views.\n\nFrom the front view:\n\n- (1,1,1)=\u25a0\n\n- (2,1,1)=\u25a0\n\n- (1,2,1)=\u25a0\n\n- (2,2,1)=\u25a1 (missing)\n\nFrom the top view:\n\n- (1,1,1)=\u25a0\n\n- (2,1,1)=\u25a0\n\n- (1,2,1)=\u25a0\n\n- (2,2,1)=\u25a0\n\nFrom the right side view:\n\n- (2,1,1)=\u25a0\n\n- (2,1,2)=\u25a0\n\n- (2,2,1)=\u25a1\n\n- (2,2,2)=\u25a1\n\nBut the top view shows (2,2,1)=\u25a0 and (2,2,2)=\u25a0. However, from the right side view, (2,2,1) and (2,2,2) are missing. This implies that the cubes at (2,2,1) and (2,2,2) are present but not visible from the right side, meaning they are behind the cubes at x=1.\n\nSo, the cube at (2,2,1) is present but hidden from the front and right views because there are cubes in front of it at (2,2,2). Similarly, the cube at (2,2,2) is present but hidden from the right view.\n\nWait, no, from the right side view, we see x=2, so (2,2,1) and (2,2,2) are at x=2, y=2, z=1 and z=2. But since they are shown as \u25a1, they are missing.\n\nBut from the top view, (2,2,1) and (2,2,2) are present, so they must be at x=1.\n\nTherefore, the cube at (2,2,1) is actually at (1,2,1), but that's already present. Similarly, (2,2,2) is at (1,2,2), which is also present.\n\nWait, no, that's not possible because (1,2,1) and (1,2,2) are already shown in the front and top views.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try a different approach.\n\nLet me consider that the object is two cubes tall and two cubes wide.\n\nFrom the front view:\n\nRow 1 (z=1): (1,1,1)=\u25a0, (2,1,1)=\u25a0\n\nRow 2 (z=2): (1,2,1)=\u25a0, (2,2,1)=\u25a1\n\nSo, in the front layer (z=1), all four cubes are present except (2,2,1). But from the top view, (2,2,1) is present, so it must be at z=2.\n\nTherefore, the cube at (2,2"

How many cubes are used to create this 3D object? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this problem here with three orthographic views of a 3D object made up of cubes. I need to figure out how many cubes are used to create this object. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what orthographic views are. They are like the front, top, and right side views of a 3D object. Each view shows the maximum extent of the object in that particular direction. So, the front view shows what the object looks like from the front, the top view from above, and the right side view from the right.\n\nGiven that, let's look at each view:\n\n**Front View:**\n```\n\u25a0 \u25a0\n\u25a0 \u25a1\n```\nSo, from the front, the object has two rows. The first row has two cubes, and the second row has one cube with a space next to it.\n\n**Top View:**\n```\n\u25a0 \u25a0\n\u25a0 \u25a0\n```\nFrom the top, the object is a 2x2 square. That means, in the top-down view, it covers four cubes arranged in a square.\n\n**Right Side View:**\n```\n\u25a0 \u25a0\n\u25a1 \u25a1\n```\nFrom the right side, the object has two rows as well. The first row has two cubes, and the second row has two empty spaces.\n\nNow, to find the total number of cubes, I need to figure out how these views overlap in 3D space. It's like solving a jigsaw puzzle where each view gives a piece of the overall structure.\n\nLet me try to visualize or sketch this out mentally.\n\nStarting with the Front View:\n- It's a 2x2 grid in the first row and a 2x1 grid in the second row. So, it's like a staircase going back.\n\nThe Top View is a full 2x2 square, meaning that the object extends equally in both the x and y directions from the front view.\n\nThe Right Side View shows that on the right side, the first row has two cubes, and the second row is empty. So, it's like a step going back on the right side as well.\n\nPutting this together, the object must have some overlapping cubes that are seen in multiple views.\n\nLet me assign coordinates to make it easier. Let's assume the origin is at the front-left-bottom corner.\n\nLet's define the axes:\n- x-axis: Front to Back\n- y-axis: Left to Right\n- z-axis: Bottom to Top\n\nBut actually, in orthographic projections, the axes correspond to the view direction:\n- Front view: x and z axes\n- Top view: x and y axes\n- Right side view: y and z axes\n\nSo, Front View shows x and z, Top shows x and y, Right shows y and z.\n\nGiven that, let's map each view to their respective axes.\n\n**Front View (x-z plane):**\n- First row (z=1): x=1, z=1 and x=2, z=1\n- Second row (z=2): x=1, z=2 and x=2, z=2, but the second cube in the second row is empty (\u25a1). So, only x=1, z=2 is solid.\n\n**Top View (x-y plane):**\n- First row (y=1): x=1, y=1 and x=2, y=1\n- Second row (y=2): x=1, y=2 and x=2, y=2\n\n**Right Side View (y-z plane):**\n- First row (z=1): y=1, z=1 and y=2, z=1\n- Second row (z=2): y=1, z=2 and y=2, z=2, but both are empty (\u25a1).\n\nNow, let's try to figure out which cubes are solid based on these views.\n\nStarting with the Front View:\n\n1. From the front, at z=1 (first row), both x=1 and x=2 are solid.\n2. At z=2 (second row), only x=1 is solid; x=2 is empty.\n\nSo, in the x-z plane, we have:\n- (x=1, z=1): Solid\n- (x=2, z=1): Solid\n- (x=1, z=2): Solid\n- (x=2, z=2): Empty\n\nNext, the Top View:\n\n1. At y=1 (first row), both x=1 and x=2 are solid.\n2. At y=2 (second row), both x=1 and x=2 are solid.\n\nSo, in the x-y plane, we have:\n- (x=1, y=1): Solid\n- (x=2, y=1): Solid\n- (x=1, y=2): Solid\n- (x=2, y=2): Solid\n\nFinally, the Right Side View:\n\n1. At z=1 (first row), both y=1 and y=2 are solid.\n2. At z=2 (second row), both y=1 and y=2 are empty.\n\nSo, in the y-z plane, we have:\n- (y=1, z=1): Solid\n- (y=2, z=1): Solid\n- (y=1, z=2): Empty\n- (y=2, z=2): Empty\n\nNow, let's try to map these to 3D coordinates.\n\nEach cube is identified by its (x, y, z) position.\n\nFrom the Front View, we have:\n- (1,1,1): Solid\n- (2,1,1): Solid\n- (1,1,2): Solid\n- (2,1,2): Empty\n\nFrom the Top View, we have:\n- (1,1,1): Solid\n- (2,1,1): Solid\n- (1,2,1): Solid\n- (2,2,1): Solid\n- (1,1,2): Solid\n- (2,1,2): Solid\n- (1,2,2): Solid\n- (2,2,2): Solid\n\nWait, but the Front View only shows up to z=2, and the Top View shows up to y=2, so the object must be 2 units in both x, y, and z directions.\n\nBut from the Front View, at z=2, x=2 is empty, but from the Top View, at y=2, x=2 is solid. So, that means at (2,2,1) and (2,2,2), the cube at z=2 is empty, but from the Top View, (2,2,1) is solid.\n\nWait, maybe I need to reconcile these views.\n\nLet me list all possible (x,y,z) positions and mark them as solid or empty based on the views.\n\nTotal positions (since x, y, z go from 1 to 2):\n\n(1,1,1), (2,1,1)\n(1,1,2), (2,1,2)\n(1,2,1), (2,2,1)\n(1,2,2), (2,2,2)\n\nNow, let's go through each position and see if it's solid or empty based on the views.\n\n1. (1,1,1):\n   - Front View: Solid\n   - Top View: Solid\n   - Right Side View: Solid\n   => Solid\n\n2. (2,1,1):\n   - Front View: Solid\n   - Top View: Solid\n   - Right Side View: Solid\n   => Solid\n\n3. (1,1,2):\n   - Front View: Solid\n   - Top View: Solid\n   - Right Side View: Empty\n   => Solid\n\n4. (2,1,2):\n   - Front View: Empty\n   - Top View: Solid\n   - Right Side View: Empty\n   => Empty\n\n5. (1,2,1):\n   - Front View: Solid (since in Front View, at x=1, z=1 and z=2, both are solid. Wait, no, Front View at x=1, z=1 is solid, but at x=1, z=2 is also solid. So, (1,2,1) is in the second row (z=2) but x=1, which is solid. However, in the Front View, (1,2,1) corresponds to (x=1, z=2), which is solid.\n\n   - Top View: Solid\n   - Right Side View: Empty (since at z=1, y=2 is solid, but at z=2, y=2 is empty)\n   => Empty\n\n6. (2,2,1):\n   - Front View: Empty (since at x=2, z=2 is empty)\n   - Top View: Solid\n   - Right Side View: Solid (since at y=2, z=1 is solid)\n   => Solid\n\n7. (1,2,2):\n   - Front View: Empty (since x=1, z=2 is solid, but (1,2,2) is x=1, y=2, z=2. Wait, Front View is x-z, so (x=1, z=2) is solid, regardless of y. So, Front View doesn't care about y. So, (1,2,2) is in the same x-z column as (1,1,2). Since Front View shows (1,1,2) as solid, but (1,2,2) is also in that column, but we need to check if it's solid or empty.\n\n   Wait, no. In the Front View, each column (fixed x) is shown in the z direction. So, for x=1, z=1 and z=2 are both solid. That means, in 3D, at x=1, both z=1 and z=2 are solid, regardless of y. So, (1,1,1), (1,2,1), (1,1,2), (1,2,2) are all solid in x=1.\n\n   Similarly, for x=2, only z=1 is solid, so (2,1,1), (2,2,1) are solid, and (2,1,2), (2,2,2) are empty.\n\n   So, (1,2,2): Solid\n\n   - Front View: Solid\n   - Top View: Solid (since at y=2, x=1 is solid)\n   - Right Side View: Empty (since at z=2, y=2 is empty)\n   => Solid\n\n8. (2,2,2):\n   - Front View: Empty\n   - Top View: Solid\n   - Right Side View: Empty\n   => Empty\n\nSo, compiling all this:\n\nSolid cubes:\n1. (1,1,1): Solid\n2. (2,1,1): Solid\n3. (1,1,2): Solid\n4. (1,2,2): Solid\n5. (2,2,1): Solid\n\nEmpty cubes:\n4. (2,1,2): Empty\n5. (1,2,1): Empty\n6. (2,2,2): Empty\n\nWait, but let's double-check:\n\nFrom the Front View:\n- At x=1, both z=1 and z=2 are solid.\n- At x=2, only z=1 is solid.\n\nFrom the Top View:\n- At y=1, both x=1 and x=2 are solid.\n- At y=2, both x=1 and x=2 are solid.\n\nFrom the Right Side View:\n- At z=1, both y=1 and y=2 are solid.\n- At z=2, both y=1 and y=2 are empty.\n\nSo, for each position:\n\n(1,1,1): Solid (all views)\n(2,1,1): Solid (all views)\n(1,1,2): Solid (Front and Top, Right says Empty. But wait, Right Side View at z=2 is empty, so (1,1,2) is at y=1, z=2. Right Side View shows y=1, z=2 as empty? Wait no, Right Side View is y-z. So, at z=1, y=1 and y=2 are solid. At z=2, y=1 and y=2 are empty.\n\nSo, (1,1,2): y=1, z=2. From Right Side View, at z=2, y=1 is empty. So, (1,1,2) is empty.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake earlier.\n\nLet me correct that.\n\nLet me list each cube and determine if it's solid or empty based on all three views.\n\n1. (1,1,1):\n   - Front: Solid\n   - Top: Solid\n   - Right: Solid\n   => Solid\n\n2. (2,1,1):\n   - Front: Solid\n   - Top: Solid\n   - Right: Solid\n   => Solid\n\n3. (1,1,2):\n   - Front: Solid\n   - Top: Solid\n   - Right: At z=2, y=1 is empty\n   => Empty\n\n4. (2,1,2):\n   - Front: Empty\n   - Top: Solid\n   - Right: At z=2, y=1 is empty\n   => Empty\n\n5. (1,2,1):\n   - Front: Solid (since x=1, z=1 is solid)\n   - Top: Solid\n   - Right: At z=1, y=2 is solid\n   => Solid? Wait, no. From the Front View, (x=1, z=1) is solid, but the Right Side View at z=1, y=2 is solid. So, (1,2,1) is at y=2, z=1. Front View doesn't care about y, so it's solid. Top View: (1,2,1) is solid. Right Side View: At z=1, y=2 is solid. So, (1,2,1) is solid.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was empty. Let me clarify.\n\nIn the Front View, x=1, z=1 is solid, regardless of y. So, (1,1,1) and (1,2,1) are both solid in x=1, z=1.\n\nSimilarly, in the Right Side View, z=1, y=1 and y=2 are solid. So, (1,1,1) and (2,1,1) are solid at z=1, y=1 and y=2.\n\nWait, no. Right Side View is y-z. So, at z=1, y=1 and y=2 are solid. That means, in 3D, (y=1, z=1) and (y=2, z=1) are solid, regardless of x.\n\nBut in the Front View, x=1, z=1 is solid, which corresponds to (x=1, y=1, z=1) and (x=1, y=2, z=1).\n\nSimilarly, x=2, z=1 is solid, which corresponds to (2,1,1) and (2,2,1).\n\nWait, I think I'm mixing up x and y. Let me clarify.\n\nIn orthographic projections:\n\n- Front View: x-z plane\n   - x increases to the right\n   - z increases going back\n\n- Top View: x-y plane\n   - x increases to the right\n   - y increases going up\n\n- Right Side View: y-z plane\n   - y increases going up\n   - z increases going back\n\nSo, in the Front View, for each x, z is shown. So, for x=1, z=1 and z=2 are solid. That means, in 3D, for x=1, both z=1 and z=2 are solid, regardless of y.\n\nSimilarly, for x=2, only z=1 is solid.\n\nIn the Top View, for each y, x is shown. So, for y=1, x=1 and x=2 are solid. For y=2, x=1 and x=2 are solid.\n\nIn the Right Side View, for each z, y is shown. So, for z=1, y=1 and y=2 are solid. For z=2, y=1 and y=2 are empty.\n\nSo, let's go back and list each cube:\n\n1. (1,1,1): x=1, y=1, z=1\n   - Front: Solid\n   - Top: Solid\n   - Right: Solid\n   => Solid\n\n2. (1,2,1): x=1, y=2, z=1\n   - Front: Solid (x=1, z=1)\n   - Top: Solid (y=2, x=1)\n   - Right: Solid (y=2, z=1)\n   => Solid\n\n3. (2,1,1): x=2, y=1, z=1\n   - Front: Solid\n   - Top: Solid\n   - Right: Solid\n   => Solid\n\n4. (2,2,1): x=2, y=2, z=1\n   - Front: Solid (x=2, z=1)\n   - Top: Solid (y=2, x=2)\n   - Right: Solid (y=2, z=1)\n   => Solid\n\n5. (1,1,2): x=1, y=1, z=2\n   - Front: Solid (x=1, z=2)\n   - Top: Solid (y=1, x=1)\n   - Right: Empty (y=1, z=2)\n   => Empty\n\n6. (1,2,2): x=1, y=2, z=2\n   - Front: Solid (x=1, z=2)\n   - Top: Solid (y=2, x=1)\n   - Right: Empty (y=2, z=2)\n   => Empty\n\n7.

(2,2,2): x=2, y=2, z=2\n   - Front: Empty\n   - Top: Solid\n   - Right: Empty\n   => Empty\n\nSo, the solid cubes are:\n1. (1,1,1)\n2. (1,2,1)\n3. (2,1,1)\n4. (2,2,1)\n5. (1,1,2)\n6"

End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: Three orthographic views (front, top, and right side) of a simple 3D object made of cubes are shown below:\n\nFront view:\n\u25a0 \u25a0\n\u25a0 \u25a1\n\nTop view:\n\u25a0 \u25a0\n\u25a0 \u25a0\n\nRight side view:\n\u25a0 \u25a0\n\u25a1 \u25a1\n\nWhere '\u25a0' represents a solid cube and '\u25a1' represents an empty space. How many cubes are used to create this 3D object? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this problem here with three orthographic views of a 3D object made up of cubes. The goal is to figure out how many cubes are used to create this object. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll try to visualize the object based on the given views. There are three views: front, top, and right side. Each view shows a 2x2 grid of cubes, but with some cubes missing (represented by empty squares, \u25a1). So, my first thought is to analyze each view individually and then see how they might overlap in 3D space.\n\nStarting with the **front view**:\n```\n\u25a0 \u25a0\n\u25a0 \u25a1\n```\nThis means that from the front, the object has two cubes on the top row and one cube on the bottom row, with the bottom right cube missing. So, in the front view, we have three cubes: the front layer has a 2x2 grid with the bottom right empty, so it looks like a \"corner\" missing on the front right.\n\nMoving on to the **top view**:\n```\n\u25a0 \u25a0\n\u25a0 \u25a0\n```\nHere, from the top, the object completely fills a 2x2 grid. That means the top layer has four cubes. So, in the top view, we have four cubes arranged in a square.\n\nLastly, the **right side view**:\n```\n\u25a0 \u25a0\n\u25a1 \u25a1\n```\nThis means that from the right side, the object has two cubes on the top row and two empty spaces on the bottom row. So, in the right side view, it looks like the rightmost column is entirely missing.\n\nNow, to figure out how these views correspond in 3D, I need to consider the positions of the cubes in 3D space. Let's assume that the x-axis is to the right, the y-axis is into the screen, and the z-axis is vertical. But sometimes, people use different notations, so I'll keep that in mind.\n\nLet me sketch a 3D coordinate system in my mind, where each cube can be identified by its (x, y, z) coordinates. Since all views are 2x2, the object is probably a 2x2x2 cube, but with some cubes missing. However, the views show different configurations, so I need to reconcile that.\n\nFrom the front view, the bottom right cube is missing. In 3D, that would correspond to the cube at position (x=1, y=2, z=1). Wait, but I need to clarify the axes. Maybe it's better to fix the axes as follows:\n\n- x-axis: Right (from left to right)\n- y-axis: Depth (from front to back)\n- z-axis: Up (from bottom to top)\n\nSo, in the front view, we look along the y-axis towards the origin. The top view is looking along the x-axis towards the origin, and the right side view is looking along the z-axis towards the origin.\n\nGiven that, let's map each view:\n\n1. **Front View (looking along y-axis):**\n   ```\n   \u25a0 \u25a0\n   \u25a0 \u25a1\n   ```\n   This means:\n   - At z=1 (front layer), x=1, y=1: \u25a0\n   - At z=1 (front layer), x=2, y=1: \u25a0\n   - At z=2 (back layer), x=1, y=1: \u25a0\n   - At z=2 (back layer), x=2, y=1: \u25a1 (empty)\n   \n   Wait, no, that might not be accurate. In orthographic views, the front view typically shows the x and z axes. So, perhaps:\n\n   From the front view, we can see x and z. So, for the front view, the grid is x vs. z.\n\n   So, the front view grid is:\n   ```\n   x=1, z=1: \u25a0\n   x=2, z=1: \u25a0\n   x=1, z=2: \u25a0\n   x=2, z=2: \u25a1\n   ```\n   So, in 3D, the front layer (z=1) is fully filled, and the back layer (z=2) is missing the (2,2) cube.\n\n2. **Top View (looking along x-axis):**\n   ```\n   \u25a0 \u25a0\n   \u25a0 \u25a0\n   ```\n   The top view shows y vs. z. So, this means that in the top layer (y=1), both x=1 and x=2 have cubes, and in the back layer (y=2), both x=1 and x=2 also have cubes.\n\n   So, in 3D:\n   - y=1, z=1: \u25a0\n   - y=1, z=2: \u25a0\n   - y=2, z=1: \u25a0\n   - y=2, z=2: \u25a0\n   So, both layers in the y-direction are fully filled.\n\n3. **Right Side View (looking along z-axis):**\n   ```\n   \u25a0 \u25a0\n   \u25a1 \u25a1\n   ```\n   The right side view shows x vs. y. So, in the right column (x=2), both y=1 and y=2 are empty, while in the left column (x=1), both y=1 and y=2 have cubes.\n\n   So, in 3D:\n   - x=1, y=1: \u25a0\n   - x=1, y=2: \u25a0\n   - x=2, y=1: \u25a1\n   - x=2, y=2: \u25a1\n\nNow, let's try to combine this information.\n\nFrom the front view, we know that in z=1 (front layer), all cubes are present, and in z=2 (back layer), the cube at x=2, y=1, z=2 is missing.\n\nFrom the top view, both y=1 and y=2 layers are fully filled in both z=1 and z=2.\n\nFrom the right side view, x=2 is entirely missing in both y=1 and y=2.\n\nSo, let's list all possible cubes in the 3D space. Since the object is 2x2x2, there are 8 possible positions, but some are missing.\n\nPossible positions are combinations of x=1,2; y=1,2; z=1,2.\n\nNow, let's see which cubes are present:\n\nFrom the front view (z=1 layer):\n- x=1, y=1, z=1: \u25a0\n- x=2, y=1, z=1: \u25a0\n- x=1, y=2, z=1: \u25a0\n- x=2, y=2, z=1: \u25a0\nWait, no. Front view shows x vs. z, so for z=1, x=1 and x=2 are present, but in z=2, x=2 is missing. So, in z=1, all four cubes are present.\n\nFrom the top view, in y=1 and y=2, both z=1 and z=2 are present. So, in y=1, z=1 and z=2 have cubes, and same for y=2.\n\nFrom the right side view, x=1 has cubes in both y=1 and y=2, but x=2 has none.\n\nSo, let's map each cube:\n\n1. x=1, y=1, z=1: Present (front view)\n2. x=2, y=1, z=1: Present (front view)\n3. x=1, y=2, z=1: Present (front view)\n4. x=2, y=2, z=1: Present (front view)\n\nNow, z=2 layer:\n\n5. x=1, y=1, z=2: Present (top view)\n6. x=2, y=1, z=2: Missing (front view)\n7. x=1, y=2, z=2: Present (top view)\n8. x=2, y=2, z=2: Missing (front view)\n\nSo, cubes 6 and 8 are missing.\n\nTherefore, the total number of cubes is 8 minus 2 = 6.\n\nWait, but let's double-check.\n\nFrom the front view, z=1 has four cubes, and z=2 has two cubes missing (positions x=2,y=1 and x=2,y=2). So, z=2 has only two cubes.\n\nFrom the top view, both y=1 and y=2 have two cubes each in z=1 and z=2, but from the right side view, x=2 is entirely missing. So, in x=2, both y=1 and y=2 in z=1 and z=2 are missing.\n\nSo, in total:\n\n- x=1: All y and z are present (4 cubes)\n- x=2: All cubes are missing (4 cubes missing)\n\nTherefore, total cubes = 4 (from x=1) + 0 (from x=2) = 4.\n\nWait, that contradicts my earlier count.\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake. Let me clarify.\n\nFrom the front view, z=1 has four cubes (all present). From the front view, z=2 has x=2,y=1 and x=2,y=2 missing. So, in z=2, x=1,y=1 and x=1,y=2 are present, but x=2,y=1 and x=2,y=2 are missing.\n\nFrom the top view, y=1 has z=1 and z=2 present in x=1 and x=2. But from the right side view, x=2 is missing in both y=1 and y=2 in all z.\n\nSo, actually, in x=2, all cubes are missing. So, in x=2, z=1 and z=2, y=1 and y=2 are all empty.\n\nTherefore, the only cubes present are in x=1, across all y and z.\n\nSo, x=1,y=1,z=1: Present\n\nx=1,y=1,z=2: Present\n\nx=1,y=2,z=1: Present\n\nx=1,y=2,z=2: Present\n\nThat's four cubes.\n\nBut wait, the front view shows that in z=1, x=2 is present, but from the right side view, x=2 is entirely missing. There's a contradiction here.\n\nI think I need to reconcile these views.\n\nLet me try a different approach.\n\nLet's consider that the front view shows x and z, with y fixed at 1 (since we're looking along the y-axis). So, in front view:\n\nAt y=1, z=1: x=1 and x=2 have cubes.\n\nAt y=2, z=1: x=1 has a cube, x=2 is empty.\n\nWait, no, the front view is a 2x2 grid, so it's more likely that in front view, y is fixed at 1, and we see x and z.\n\nSo, front view:\n\n- y=1:\n\n  - x=1, z=1: \u25a0\n\n  - x=2, z=1: \u25a0\n\n- y=2:\n\n  - x=1, z=1: \u25a0\n\n  - x=2, z=1: \u25a1\n\nWait, but in orthographic views, the front view typically shows the x and z axes, so y is fixed at 1 (the depth).\n\nTherefore, in front view:\n\n- At y=1:\n\n  - x=1, z=1: \u25a0\n\n  - x=2, z=1: \u25a0\n\n- At y=2:\n\n  - x=1, z=1: \u25a0\n\n  - x=2, z=1: \u25a1\n\nSo, in front view, at z=1, all four positions are present except that at y=2, x=2 is missing.\n\nFrom the top view, which shows y and z, with x fixed at 1 (since we're looking along x-axis):\n\n- At x=1:\n\n  - y=1, z=1: \u25a0\n\n  - y=1, z=2: \u25a0\n\n  - y=2, z=1: \u25a0\n\n  - y=2, z=2: \u25a0\n\nSo, top view shows that at x=1, all four positions are filled.\n\nFrom the right side view, which shows x and y, with z fixed at 1 (since we're looking along z-axis):\n\n- At z=1:\n\n  - x=1, y=1: \u25a0\n\n  - x=1, y=2: \u25a0\n\n  - x=2, y=1: \u25a1\n\n  - x=2, y=2: \u25a1\n\nSo, at z=1, x=2 is entirely missing.\n\nNow, let's try to combine these.\n\nFrom front view, at y=1, z=1: x=1 and x=2 have cubes.\n\nBut from right side view, at z=1, x=2 is missing. Therefore, only x=1, y=1, z=1 is present at y=1, z=1.\n\nWait, that can't be, because front view shows both x=1 and x=2 at y=1, z=1.\n\nBut right side view shows x=2 is missing at z=1, so x=2,y=1,z=1 is missing.\n\nTherefore, front view at y=1,z=1: x=1 is present, x=2 is missing.\n\nSimilarly, at y=2,z=1: front view shows x=1 is present, x=2 is missing.\n\nSo, front view:\n\n- y=1,z=1: x=1 present, x=2 missing\n\n- y=2,z=1: x=1 present, x=2 missing\n\nSo, in front view, only x=1,y=1,z=1 and x=1,y=2,z=1 are present.\n\nFrom top view, at x=1:\n\n- y=1,z=1: present\n\n- y=1,z=2: present\n\n- y=2,z=1: present\n\n- y=2,z=2: present\n\nSo, at x=1, all four cubes are present.\n\nFrom right side view, at z=1:\n\n- x=1,y=1: present\n\n- x=1,y=2: present\n\n- x=2,y=1: missing\n\n- x=2,y=2: missing\n\nSo, at z=1, only x=1 has cubes.\n\nAt z=2, right side view doesn't show anything because it's looking along z-axis. So, we need to look at front and top views for z=2.\n\nFrom front view, at y=1,z=2: x=1 and x=2. But from right side view, x=2 is missing at all y and z, so x=2,y=1,z=2 is missing.\n\nSimilarly, at y=2,z=2: from front view, x=1 is present, x=2 is missing.\n\nFrom top view, at x=1,y=1,z=2: present\n\nAt x=1,y=2,z=2: present\n\nSo, in z=2:\n\n- x=1,y=1,z=2: present\n\n- x=1,y=2,z=2: present\n\n- x=2,y=1,z=2: missing\n\n- x=2,y=2,z=2: missing\n\nTherefore, in z=2, only x=1 cubes are present.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAt z=1:\n\n- x=1,y=1,z=1: present\n\n- x=1,y=2,z=1: present\n\nAt z=2:\n\n- x=1,y=1,z=2: present\n\n- x=1,y=2,z=2: present\n\nSo, total cubes: 4.\n\nBut wait, the top view shows that at x=1, both y=1,z=1 and y=1,z=2 are present, same for y=2. So, that aligns with our count.\n\nSimilarly, front view shows that at y=1,z=1: x=1 present, x=2 missing; and at y=2,z=1: x=1 present, x=2 missing.\n\nRight side view shows that at z=1: x=1,y=1 and x=1,y=2 present; x=2,y=1 and x=2,y=2 missing.\n\nSo, combining all, the only cubes present are:\n\n(1,1,1), (1,2,1), (1,1,2), (1,2,2)\n\nThat's four cubes.\n\nWait, but the front view shows three cubes in the front layer (z=1), but according to this, only two cubes are present in z=1 (since x=2 is missing in both y=1 and y=2). Hmm.\n\nWait, no. Front view shows:\n\nAt y=1,z=1: x=1 and x=2 (but x=2 is missing from right side view), so only x=1,y=1,z=1 is present.\n\nSimilarly, at y=2,z=1: x=1,y=2,z=1 is present.\n\nSo, front view shows two cubes in z=1.\n\nBut according to our 3D mapping, only those two are present.\n\nIn z=2, top view shows four cubes, but from front view, only x=1,y=1,z=2 and x=1,y=2,z=2 are present.\n\nSo, total cubes: 2 (z=1) + 2 (z=2) = 4.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 4 cubes.\n\nBut wait, let me check again.\n\nFrom front view:\n\n- y=1,z=1: x=1 present, x=2 missing (so only 1 cube)\n\n- y=2,z=1: x=1 present, x=2 missing (so only 1 cube)\n\nSo, total in z=1: 2 cubes.\n\nFrom top view:\n\n- x=1,y=1,z=1: present\n\n- x=1,y=1,z=2: present\n\n- x=1,y=2,z=1: present\n\n- x=1,y=2,z=2: present\n\nSo, in x=1, all four cubes are present.\n\nFrom right side view:\n\n- z=1: x=1,y=1 and x=1,y=2 present\n\n- z=2: Since right side view is looking along z-axis, it doesn't show z=2.\n\nBut from front view, at y=1,z=2: x=1 present, x=2 missing\n\nSimilarly, at y=2,z=2: x=1 present, x=2 missing\n\nTherefore, in z=2:\n\n- x=1,y=1,z=2: present\n\n- x=1,y=2,z=2: present\n\nSo, total cubes:"

I need to figure out how many cubes are used to create this 3D object. Hmm, let me see. Okay, first, I should probably visualize each view and then try to imagine what the object might look like in 3D.\n\nStarting with the front view. It's a 2x2 grid, right? The first row has two solid cubes, and the second row has a solid cube and an empty space. So, in the front view, it's like:\n\n\u25a0 \u25a0  \n\u25a0 \u25a1\n\nThat means, from the front, we see two cubes on the top and one cube on the bottom, but the bottom right is empty. So, the front face is kind of L-shaped.\n\nNext, the top view. It's also a 2x2 grid:\n\n\u25a0 \u25a0  \n\u25a0 \u25a0\n\nSo, from the top, we see all four positions are filled with cubes. That means the object is at least 2 units tall because the top view shows a full 2x2 grid.\n\nNow, the right side view. This is a bit trickier because it's the side view, so it shows the depth of the object. The right side view is:\n\n\u25a0 \u25a0  \n\u25a1 \u25a1\n\nSo, from the right side, the top row has two cubes, and the bottom row has two empty spaces. That suggests that the object is deeper on the left side but not on the right side. So, maybe the right side is just two cubes sticking out, but the left side is more solid.\n\nPutting this all together, I think the object has a sort of step or platform on the right side that's two cubes high and two cubes wide, but on the front, it's only one cube deep on the right. Hmm, maybe it's a combination of a 2x2x2 cube with some parts missing.\n\nWait, let me think again. The front view shows an L-shape, the top view shows all filled, and the right side view shows two on top and two empty on the bottom. So, maybe it's a 2x2x2 cube minus some parts. But I need to be careful not to double-count or miss any cubes.\n\nLet me try to sketch it out mentally. If I imagine looking at the front, I see two cubes on the top row and one on the bottom, so maybe the front layer is like that. The top view shows all four positions filled, so that suggests that the back layer is also filled. But the right side view shows two on top and two empty on the bottom, so maybe the right side is only two cubes tall.\n\nWait, maybe it's a 3x2x2 object? No, that might be too big. Let me think about each layer.\n\nFront layer (z=0): two cubes on the top row (y=1,2) and one cube on the bottom row (y=1). So, positions (0,0,0), (0,1,0), and (0,0,1). Wait, no, because in the front view, the second row has one cube and one empty. So, maybe (0,0,0), (0,1,0), and (0,0,1).\n\nBut then the top view shows all four positions filled, so in the top layer (z=1), we have cubes at (0,0,1), (0,1,1), (1,0,1), and (1,1,1). So, four cubes in total on the top layer.\n\nThe right side view shows two on top and two empty on the bottom, so in the right side (x=1), the top layer (z=1) has cubes at (1,0,1) and (1,1,1), which matches the top view. On the bottom layer (z=0), the right side (x=1) has two empty spaces, so positions (1,0,0) and (1,1,0) are empty.\n\nPutting it all together, the front layer has cubes at (0,0,0), (0,1,0), and (0,0,1). The top layer has four cubes, but the right side view tells us that on the bottom layer, (1,0,0) and (1,1,0) are empty, so only (0,0,0) and (0,1,0) are present on the front layer. So, total cubes would be:\n\nFront layer: 3 cubes  \nTop layer: 4 cubes  \nBut wait, the top layer is z=1, and the front layer is z=0. However, the right side view shows that on the bottom layer (z=0), the right side (x=1) is empty. So, we need to make sure we don't double-count the cubes that are shared between layers.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this differently. Let's think about the x, y, z coordinates. Let's assume the front view is along the y-axis, the top view is along the x-axis, and the right side view is along the z-axis. So, x is right-left, y is front-back, and z is up-down.\n\nFrom the front view (along y-axis), we see:\n\nAt y=0 (front), x=0, z=0 and z=1 are solid, and x=1, z=0 is solid. So, (0,0,0), (0,0,1), (1,0,0).\n\nWait, no, the front view is two rows. The first row is two cubes, so (0,0,0) and (1,0,0). The second row is one cube and one empty, so (0,1,0) and (1,1,0), but (1,1,0) is empty. So, front view cubes are (0,0,0), (1,0,0), and (0,1,0).\n\nFrom the top view (along x-axis), we see all four positions (y=0 and y=1, z=0 and z=1) are solid. So, (0,0,0), (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (1,1,0), (0,0,1), (1,0,1), (0,1,1), (1,1,1). But wait, the top view is 2x2, so y=0 and y=1, z=0 and z=1. So, all eight positions are solid? No, wait, the top view shows two rows of two each, so four cubes in total, meaning (0,0,0), (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (1,1,0) are solid on the bottom layer, and (0,0,1), (1,0,1), (0,1,1), (1,1,1) are solid on the top layer.\n\nBut from the front view, we know that (1,1,0) is empty. So, the top view shows four cubes on the bottom and four on the top, but the front view tells us that (1,1,0) is empty, so actually, the bottom layer has three cubes: (0,0,0), (1,0,0), and (0,1,0). The top layer has four cubes: (0,0,1), (1,0,1), (0,1,1), and (1,1,1).\n\nNow, from the right side view (along z-axis), we see x=0 and x=1, y=0 and y=1. The top row (z=1) has two cubes, and the bottom row (z=0) has two empty spaces. So, at z=1, x=0 and x=1 are solid, but at z=0, x=0 and x=1 are empty. Wait, no, the right side view is:\n\n\u25a0 \u25a0  \n\u25a1 \u25a1\n\nSo, at x=0, z=0: empty, z=1: solid  \nAt x=1, z=0: empty, z=1: solid\n\nBut wait, that can't be because the front view has (1,0,0) as solid. Maybe I'm getting the axes mixed up.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to assign axes as follows: x is right-left, y is front-back, z is up-down.\n\nSo, front view is along the y-axis, showing x and z.\n\nTop view is along the x-axis, showing y and z.\n\nRight side view is along the z-axis, showing x and y.\n\nSo, front view (y=0): x=0, z=0 and z=1 are solid, x=1, z=0 is solid, x=1, z=1 is empty. So, cubes at (0,0,0), (0,0,1), (1,0,0), and (1,0,1) is empty.\n\nWait, no, the front view is:\n\n\u25a0 \u25a0  \n\u25a0 \u25a1\n\nSo, at y=0 (front), x=0, z=0 and z=1 are solid, and x=1, z=0 is solid, x=1, z=1 is empty. So, cubes at (0,0,0), (0,0,1), (1,0,0).\n\nAt y=1, x=0, z=0 is solid, x=1, z=0 is empty. So, cube at (0,1,0).\n\nSo, front view has cubes at (0,0,0), (0,0,1), (1,0,0), and (0,1,0).\n\nTop view (x=0 and x=1, y=0 and y=1):\n\n\u25a0 \u25a0  \n\u25a0 \u25a0\n\nSo, at x=0, y=0 and y=1, z=0 and z=1 are solid. So, cubes at (0,0,0), (0,0,1), (0,1,0), (0,1,1).\n\nAt x=1, same: (1,0,0), (1,0,1), (1,1,0), (1,1,1).\n\nBut from the front view, we know that (1,0,1) is empty, so actually, the top view is showing all four positions as solid, but the front view tells us that (1,0,1) is empty. So, the top view is misleading because it's an orthographic projection, not a true top-down view. So, we have to reconcile the views.\n\nSimilarly, the right side view is along z-axis, showing x and y:\n\n\u25a0 \u25a0  \n\u25a1 \u25a1\n\nSo, at z=0, x=0, y=0 and y=1: solid, so (0,0,0) and (0,1,0).  \nAt z=1, x=0, y=0 and y=1: solid, so (0,0,1) and (0,1,1).  \nBut the right side view shows:\n\nTop row (z=1): two solids  \nBottom row (z=0): two empties\n\nWait, that contradicts the front view, which has (0,1,0) as solid. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding the right side view.\n\nWait, the right side view is:\n\n\u25a0 \u25a0  \n\u25a1 \u25a1\n\nSo, at x=0, z=0: solid, z=1: solid  \nAt x=1, z=0: empty, z=1: empty\n\nBut from the front view, we have (1,0,0) as solid, which is x=1, y=0, z=0. So, in the right side view, x=1, z=0 is empty, but in reality, (1,0,0) is solid. So, perhaps the right side view is showing y=0 and y=1, so at x=0, y=0 and y=1, z=0 and z=1. So, if the right side view shows two solids on top and two empties on bottom, that would mean that at x=0, y=0, z=1 and y=1, z=1 are solid, and at x=0, y=0, z=0 and y=1, z=0 are empty. But that contradicts the front view, which has (0,1,0) as solid.\n\nI think I need to approach this systematically. Let's list all possible positions and see which ones are solid based on the views.\n\nWe have x, y, z coordinates, each from 0 to 1 (since it's 2x2x2).\n\nFrom front view (y=0):\n\n- (0,0,0): solid  \n- (1,0,0): solid  \n- (0,0,1): solid  \n- (1,0,1): empty (since front view second row, x=1 is empty)\n\nFrom front view (y=1):\n\n- (0,1,0): solid  \n- (1,1,0): empty (front view second row, x=1 is empty)  \n- (0,1,1): ?  \n- (1,1,1): ?\n\nFrom top view (x=0 and x=1):\n\n- At x=0: all y and z positions are solid. So, (0,0,0), (0,0,1), (0,1,0), (0,1,1) are solid.\n\n- At x=1: all y and z positions are solid. So, (1,0,0), (1,0,1), (1,1,0), (1,1,1) are solid.\n\nBut from front view, we know that (1,0,1) is empty. So, actually, at x=1, y=0, z=1 is empty, but the top view shows it as solid. So, the top view is misleading, probably because it's an orthographic projection that doesn't show depth.\n\nSimilarly, from the right side view (z=0 and z=1):\n\n- At z=0: (0,0,0), (0,1,0), (1,0,0), (1,1,0). From front view, (1,1,0) is empty, so right side view shows (0,0,0), (0,1,0), (1,0,0) as solids and (1,1,0) as empty. But the right side view shows:\n\n\u25a0 \u25a0  \n\u25a1 \u25a1\n\nWhich would correspond to (0,0,0), (0,1,0), (1,0,0) as solid and (1,1,0) as empty. So, that matches.\n\nAt z=1:\n\n- (0,0,1), (0,1,1), (1,0,1), (1,1,1). From top view, all are solid, but from front view, (1,0,1) is empty. So, in reality, (1,0,1) is empty, but the others are solid.\n\nBut the right side view shows:\n\nTop row (z=1): two solids  \nBottom row (z=0): two empties\n\nWait, no, the right side view is:\n\n\u25a0 \u25a0  \n\u25a1 \u25a1\n\nWhich would mean that at z=1, both x=0 and x=1 are solid, and at z=0, both x=0 and x=1 are empty. But from the front view, we have (0,1,0) as solid, which is x=0, y=1, z=0. So, this contradicts.\n\nI think the confusion comes from how the orthographic views are presented. Maybe the right side view is along the y-axis, showing x and z. So, in that case, for the right side view:\n\nAt y=0: x=0, z=0 and z=1 are solid  \nAt y=1: x=0, z=0 is solid, x=1, z=0 is empty\n\nWait, that might make more sense. So, the right side view is along the y-axis, showing x and z.\n\nSo, for y=0:\n\n- x=0, z=0: solid  \n- x=0, z=1: solid  \n- x=1, z=0: solid  \n- x=1, z=1: empty\n\nFor y=1:\n\n- x=0, z=0: solid  \n- x=0, z=1: solid  \n- x=1, z=0: empty  \n- x=1, z=1: empty\n\nSo, the right side view would look like:\n\nFor y=0: \u25a0 \u25a0  \nFor y=1: \u25a0 \u25a1\n\nWhich matches the given right side view:\n\n\u25a0 \u25a0  \n\u25a1 \u25a1\n\nSo, that makes sense now. So, from the right side view (along y-axis):\n\n- At y=0 (front), x=0, z=0 and z=1 are solid; x=1, z=0 is solid, x=1, z=1 is empty.\n\n- At y=1 (back), x=0, z=0 and z=1 are solid; x=1, z=0 is empty, x=1, z=1 is empty.\n\nSo, combining all this:\n\nFrom front view (y=0):\n\n- (0,0,0), (1,0,0), (0,0,1)\n\nFrom front view (y=1):\n\n- (0,1,0), (0,1,1)\n\nFrom top view (x=0 and x=1):\n\n- x=0: (0,0,0), (0,0,1), (0,1,0), (0,1,1) \u2013 all solid  \n- x=1: (1,0,0), (1,0,1), (1,1,0), (1,1,1). But from front view, (1,0,1) is empty, so only (1,0,0), (1,1,0) are solid on the bottom layer. On the top layer, (1,0,1) is empty, so only (1,1,1) is solid? Wait, no, the top view shows all as solid, but the front view tells us (1,0,1) is empty. So, in reality, the top layer at x=1, y=0, z=1 is empty, but y=1, z=1 is solid.\n\nSimilarly, the right side view tells us that at y=1, x=1, z=0 is empty, so (1,1,0) is empty.\n\nSo, let's list all the cubes:\n\nBottom layer (z=0):\n\n- x=0: y=0 and y=1, z=0: (0,0,0), (0,1,0) \u2013"

End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: Three orthographic views (front, top, and right side) of a simple 3D object made of cubes are shown below:\n\nFront view:\n\u25a0 \u25a0\n\u25a0 \u25a1\n\nTop view:\n\u25a0 \u25a0\n\u25a0 \u25a0\n\nRight side view:\n\u25a0 \u25a0\n\u25a1 \u25a1\n\nWhere '\u25a0' represents a solid cube and '\u25a1' represents an empty space. How many cubes are used to create this 3D object? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this problem here with three orthographic views of a 3D object made up of cubes. I need to figure out how many cubes are used to create this object. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll try to visualize the object based on the given views. The object is made up of cubes, so each '\u25a0' is a solid cube, and '\u25a1' represents an empty space. There are three views: front, top, and right side. I'll analyze each view one by one and see how they overlap in 3D space.\n\nStarting with the **front view**:\n```\n\u25a0 \u25a0\n\u25a0 \u25a1\n```\nThis means that from the front, the object has two cubes on the top row and one cube on the bottom row, with an empty space in the bottom right corner. So, in the front view, we can see three cubes: two stacked vertically on the left and one to the right on the bottom row.\n\nNext, the **top view**:\n```\n\u25a0 \u25a0\n\u25a0 \u25a0\n```\nFrom the top, the object has two cubes on the left and two cubes on the right. This suggests that the object is two cubes wide and two cubes deep. So, in the top view, we see a 2x2 grid of cubes, but since the front view only shows three cubes, I need to figure out how they are arranged in 3D.\n\nFinally, the **right side view**:\n```\n\u25a0 \u25a0\n\u25a1 \u25a1\n```\nThis view shows that on the right side, there are two cubes on the top row and two empty spaces on the bottom row. So, from the right, the object is two cubes tall and two cubes deep on the right side.\n\nNow, let's try to reconcile these views to find the 3D structure.\n\nFrom the front view, we have cubes at positions:\n- Front-Left-Top (FLT)\n- Front-Left-Bottom (FLB)\n- Front-Right-Bottom (FRB)\n\nFrom the top view, which shows a 2x2 grid, we can infer that the object extends two cubes deep into the screen. So, the front view is the front face, and the right side view is the right face.\n\nCombining the front and right side views, the object should have cubes at positions:\n- Front-Left-Top (FLT)\n- Front-Left-Bottom (FLB)\n- Front-Right-Bottom (FRB)\n- Right-Back-Top (RBT)\n- Right-Back-Bottom (RBB)\n\nBut wait, from the top view, it's two cubes deep, so the front view is the front face, and the right side view is the right face. The top view shows that there are two cubes on the left and two on the right, so the depth is two cubes.\n\nNow, let's map the positions:\n\n1. **Front-Left-Top (FLT):** This is the front-left cube on the top layer.\n2. **Front-Left-Bottom (FLB):** This is directly below FLT.\n3. **Front-Right-Bottom (FRB):** This is in the front-right position on the bottom layer.\n4. **Right-Back-Top (RBT):** Since the right side view shows two cubes on the top, this must be the cube behind FRB on the top layer.\n5. **Right-Back-Bottom (RBB):** Similarly, this is behind FRB on the bottom layer.\n\nBut wait, from the front view, the bottom row only has two cubes: FLB and FRB. However, the right side view shows two cubes on the top and two on the bottom. That suggests that on the right side, there are two cubes on the top layer and two on the bottom layer, but the front view only shows one cube on the bottom layer (FRB). This implies that there's another cube behind FRB on the bottom layer, which is RBB.\n\nSo, the total cubes would be:\n\n- Front layer: FLT, FLB, FRB\n- Right layer: RBT, RBB\n\nThat's five cubes. But let's double-check with the top view. The top view shows a 2x2 grid, meaning there are four cubes in total, but according to our current count, we have five cubes. This discrepancy suggests I might be missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcounting. Let's consider that the top view shows two cubes on the left and two on the right, but they could be arranged in such a way that some cubes are shared between the front and right views.\n\nLet me try another approach: using the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\n\nEach view gives us the number of cubes along that axis:\n\n- Front view: 3 cubes\n- Top view: 4 cubes\n- Right view: 3 cubes\n\nBut since these are projections, the actual number of cubes is likely less than the sum of the projections.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the object as a 2x2x2 cube missing some parts. But since the front view has three cubes, it's not a solid cube.\n\nAnother way is to consider each position in 3D:\n\nLet's define the coordinates as (X, Y, Z), where:\n- X: Right-Left axis\n- Y: Front-Back axis\n- Z: Up-Down axis\n\nFrom the front view (Y=0):\n- (X=0, Y=0, Z=0) = FLT\n- (X=1, Y=0, Z=0) = FLB (Wait, no. In front view, the first row is top, so (X=0, Y=0, Z=0) and (X=1, Y=0, Z=0) are both cubes, but in the given front view, it's:\n```\n\u25a0 \u25a0\n\u25a0 \u25a1\n```\nSo, at Z=0 (front layer), X=0 and X=1 are cubes. At Z=1 (back layer), only X=0 is a cube.\n\nWait, no, the front view is two rows, so Z=0 is the front row, and Z=1 is the back row.\n\nSo, at Z=0:\n- X=0, Y=0, Z=0: FLT\n- X=1, Y=0, Z=0: FLB (Wait, but in the front view, the bottom row is \u25a0 \u25a1, which would be Z=1. So perhaps I have the layers inverted.\n\nWait, maybe I got the layers wrong. Let's clarify:\n\nIn orthographic views, typically:\n- Front view: Z=0 is the front layer, Y=0 is the right side, X=0 is the left side.\n- Top view: X=0 is front, X=1 is back.\n- Right side view: Y=0 is front, Y=1 is back.\n\nWait, no, that might not be accurate. Let's define the axes properly.\n\nLet me define:\n- X-axis: Right-Left\n- Y-axis: Front-Back\n- Z-axis: Up-Down\n\nSo, in the front view (looking along the Y-axis), we see X and Z.\n\nIn the top view (looking along the X-axis), we see Y and Z.\n\nIn the right side view (looking along the Y-axis from the right), we see X and Z.\n\nGiven that, let's redefine the views:\n\nFront view (Y=0):\n```\n\u25a0 \u25a0\n\u25a0 \u25a1\n```\nThis means at Z=0 (front layer):\n- X=0, Y=0, Z=0: FLT\n- X=1, Y=0, Z=0: FLB\nAt Z=1 (back layer):\n- X=0, Y=0, Z=1: FLA\n- X=1, Y=0, Z=1: FLB (empty)\n\nWait, but in the front view, the bottom row is \u25a0 \u25a1, which would correspond to Z=1 (since front view typically has Z increasing upwards). So:\n\nAt Z=0 (front layer):\n- X=0, Y=0, Z=0: FLT\n- X=1, Y=0, Z=0: FLB (empty, since front view shows \u25a0 \u25a1)\n\nWait, no, in the front view, the top row is two cubes, and the bottom row is one cube. So:\n\nAt Z=0 (front layer):\n- X=0, Y=0, Z=0: FLT\n- X=1, Y=0, Z=0: FLB (empty)\n\nAt Z=1 (back layer):\n- X=0, Y=0, Z=1: FLA (empty)\n- X=1, Y=0, Z=1: FLB (empty)\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because the front view shows a cube at Z=1, X=0. Let me clarify.\n\nActually, in the front view, the rows are ordered from front to back, but in orthographic projection, the front view shows the front layer (Z=0) as the top row and the back layer (Z=1) as the bottom row. So, the front view's top row is Z=0, and the bottom row is Z=1.\n\nGiven that, the front view is:\n\nZ=0 (top row):\n- X=0: \u25a0\n- X=1: \u25a0\n\nZ=1 (bottom row):\n- X=0: \u25a0\n- X=1: \u25a1\n\nSo, the cubes are at:\n- (0,0,0)\n- (1,0,0)\n- (0,0,1)\n\nNow, the top view (looking along X-axis, so Y and Z):\n\nTop view:\n```\n\u25a0 \u25a0\n\u25a0 \u25a0\n```\nThis means at Y=0 (front) and Y=1 (back):\n- Y=0, Z=0: \u25a0\n- Y=0, Z=1: \u25a0\n- Y=1, Z=0: \u25a0\n- Y=1, Z=1: \u25a0\n\nSo, the top view shows four cubes: (0,0,0), (0,0,1), (0,1,0), (0,1,1). But wait, in our front view, we have (1,0,0) as empty, so there shouldn't be a cube at (1,0,0). This suggests that the top view is showing cubes at (0,0,0), (0,0,1), (0,1,0), (0,1,1), but from the front view, only (0,0,0), (0,0,1), and (1,0,0) are present, with (1,0,0) being empty. This is conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the top view. Let me think again.\n\nIn the top view, looking along the X-axis, we see Y and Z. So, each column corresponds to Y, and each row to Z.\n\nGiven that, the top view shows two cubes on the left and two on the right, meaning:\n\n- Y=0 (front), Z=0: \u25a0\n- Y=0 (front), Z=1: \u25a0\n- Y=1 (back), Z=0: \u25a0\n- Y=1 (back), Z=1: \u25a0\n\nSo, four cubes: (0,0,0), (0,0,1), (0,1,0), (0,1,1).\n\nBut from the front view, we have cubes at (0,0,0), (0,0,1), and (1,0,0) is empty. However, in the top view, (0,1,0) and (0,1,1) are cubes. So, that suggests that the object has cubes at (0,0,0), (0,0,1), (0,1,0), (0,1,1), but from the front view, (1,0,0) is empty, meaning there's no cube at (1,0,0). But in the right side view, we have:\n\nRight side view (looking along Y-axis from the right, so X and Z):\n\n```\n\u25a0 \u25a0\n\u25a1 \u25a1\n```\nThis means at X=0 (front) and X=1 (back):\n- X=0, Z=0: \u25a0\n- X=0, Z=1: \u25a0\n- X=1, Z=0: \u25a1\n- X=1, Z=1: \u25a1\n\nSo, cubes at (0,0,0), (0,0,1), and empty at (1,0,0), (1,0,1).\n\nNow, let's reconcile all three views:\n\nFrom front view:\n- (0,0,0): \u25a0\n- (0,0,1): \u25a0\n- (1,0,0): \u25a1\n- (1,0,1): \u25a1\n\nFrom top view:\n- (0,0,0): \u25a0\n- (0,0,1): \u25a0\n- (0,1,0): \u25a0\n- (0,1,1): \u25a0\n\nFrom right view:\n- (0,0,0): \u25a0\n- (0,0,1): \u25a0\n- (1,0,0): \u25a1\n- (1,0,1): \u25a1\n\nSo, the only cubes present are:\n\n- (0,0,0)\n- (0,0,1)\n- (0,1,0)\n- (0,1,1)\n\nThat's four cubes in total. But wait, in the front view, we have three cubes, but the top view shows four. How does that reconcile?\n\nAh, because in the front view, the cube at (1,0,0) is empty, so the front view only shows three cubes, but the top view shows four because it's looking from the top, so it includes the back row as well.\n\nSo, the object has four cubes in total.\n\nWait, but let me double-check with the right side view. The right side view shows two cubes on the top and two on the bottom, but according to our 3D structure, the right side view should show:\n\nAt X=0, Z=0: \u25a0\nAt X=0, Z=1: \u25a0\nAt X=1, Z=0: \u25a1\nAt X=1, Z=1: \u25a1\n\nSo, the right side view shows two cubes, but in the given problem, the right side view is:\n\n```\n\u25a0 \u25a0\n\u25a1 \u25a1\n```\nWhich matches our structure: two cubes on top (X=0, Z=0 and X=0, Z=1) and two empty spaces on the bottom (X=1, Z=0 and X=1, Z=1).\n\nSo, putting it all together, the object has four cubes.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought there were five cubes, but now I'm getting four. Let me confirm:\n\nCubes present:\n\n1. (0,0,0): Front-Left-Top\n2. (0,0,1): Front-Left-Bottom\n3. (0,1,0): Back-Left-Top\n4. (0,1,1): Back-Left-Bottom\n\nThat's four cubes. The front view shows three because it's looking at the front layer (Z=0 and Z=1) but only shows the front row as two cubes and the back row as one cube. The top view shows four because it includes both Y=0 and Y=1. The right side view shows two cubes on top and two on the bottom, which matches our structure.\n\nSo, the total number of cubes used is four.\n\nWait, but let me visualize this again. If I have four cubes arranged in a 2x2 grid in the Y-Z plane, with X=0 (left side) and X=1 (right side). But from the front view, X=1 is empty in both layers, so the front view only shows X=0.\n\nSo, yes, the object is a 2x2x1 structure on the left side, with X=0 having four cubes, and X=1 being empty. Therefore, four cubes in total.\n\nBut wait, in the front view, the bottom row is \u25a0 \u25a1, which would be (0,0,1) and (1,0,1). But in our structure, (1,0,1) is empty, so the front view correctly shows \u25a0 \u25a1.\n\nSimilarly, the top view shows four cubes because it's looking along X, so it includes both Y=0 and Y=1.\n\nAnd the right side view shows two cubes on top (X=0, Z=0 and X=0, Z=1) and two empty on the bottom (X=1, Z=0 and X=1, Z=1).\n\nSo, yes, four cubes in total.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be four cubes.\n</think>\n\nThe object consists of four cubes arranged in a 2x2 grid on the left side, with an empty space on the right side.\n\nDONE."

How many cubes are used to create this 3D object? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I've got this problem here with three orthographic views of a 3D object made up of cubes. I need to figure out how many cubes are used to create it. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall what orthographic views are. They are the three main projections of a 3D object: front, top, and right side. Each view shows the maximum extent of the object along the respective axis. So, the front view shows the depth from left to right, the top view shows the height from bottom to top, and the right side view shows the width from front to back.\n\nLooking at the front view:\n\n\u25a0 \u25a0\n\u25a0 \u25a1\n\nThis is a 2x2 grid of cubes, but the bottom right cube is empty. So, in the front view, we can see that there are three solid cubes and one empty space.\n\nNext, the top view:\n\n\u25a0 \u25a0\n\u25a0 \u25a0\n\nThis is a full 2x2 grid with all cubes solid. So, from the top, we can see that there are four solid cubes arranged in a square.\n\nNow, the right side view:\n\n\u25a0 \u25a0\n\u25a1 \u25a1\n\nThis shows that on the right side, the top two cubes are solid, and the bottom two are empty. So, from the right, we can see two solid cubes stacked vertically.\n\nTo get a clear picture, I think I should visualize or sketch the object based on these views. Let me try to imagine the 3D structure.\n\nStarting with the front view, which has three solid cubes and one empty. Let's assume the front view is the one we look at directly. So, in the front, the left column is solid (two cubes) and the right column has one solid cube on top and one empty at the bottom. So, it looks like:\n\nLeft column: Solid (from front to back, let's say depth)\nRight column: Top is solid, bottom is empty.\n\nBut wait, the front view is 2 units wide and 2 units tall. So, each cell in the front view represents a cube.\n\nFront view:\n- (Front-Left, Front-Top) = Solid\n- (Front-Left, Front-Bottom) = Solid\n- (Front-Right, Front-Top) = Solid\n- (Front-Right, Front-Bottom) = Empty\n\nSo, Front-Left has two cubes, Front-Right has one cube on top.\n\nNow, the top view is also 2x2, all solid. So, from the top, looking down, everything is solid. This means that in the vertical direction (height), all positions are occupied.\n\nRight side view is 2 units tall, with the top two cubes solid and the bottom two empty. So, from the right, looking left, the top is solid, bottom is empty.\n\nThis suggests that on the right side, the height is two cubes, but the bottom is empty.\n\nNow, to reconcile these views, I need to figure out how the cubes are arranged in 3D.\n\nLet me try to assign coordinates to the cubes. Let's set the origin at the front-left-bottom corner.\n\nSo, the x-axis goes from left to right (width), y-axis goes from front to back (depth), and z-axis goes from bottom to top (height).\n\nFrom the front view:\n\n- At (0,0,z): Solid (Front-Left, Front-Bottom)\n- At (0,0,1): Solid (Front-Left, Front-Top)\n- At (1,0,z): Solid (Front-Right, Front-Bottom)\n- At (1,0,1): Solid (Front-Right, Front-Top)\n\nBut wait, the front view shows that at (1,0,z), the bottom (z=0) is empty. So, Front-Right, Front-Bottom is empty.\n\nWait, no, in the front view, the Front-Right, Front-Bottom is empty, so (1,0,0) is empty.\n\nSimilarly, Front-Right, Front-Top (1,0,1) is solid.\n\nSo, Front view:\n\n- (0,0,0): Solid\n- (0,0,1): Solid\n- (1,0,0): Empty\n- (1,0,1): Solid\n\nTop view is:\n\n- (x,0,0): Solid\n- (x,0,1): Solid\n- (x,1,0): Solid\n- (x,1,1): Solid\n\nSo, from top, all positions (x, y, z) are solid, meaning every cube is present.\n\nRight side view:\n\nLooking from the right (positive x direction), we see:\n\n- (0,0,0): Solid\n- (0,0,1): Solid\n- (0,1,0): Empty\n- (0,1,1): Empty\n\nWait, no. The right side view shows:\n\n\u25a0 \u25a0\n\u25a1 \u25a1\n\nSo, in the right side view, the top row is solid, and the bottom row is empty.\n\nIn terms of coordinates, looking from the right (positive x), the y-axis is depth (from front to back), and z-axis is height.\n\nSo, the right side view shows:\n\n- (0,0,0): Solid\n- (0,0,1): Solid\n- (0,1,0): Empty\n- (0,1,1): Empty\n\nSo, for y=0 (front), z=0 and z=1 are solid.\n\nFor y=1 (back), z=0 and z=1 are empty.\n\nSo, now, let's try to map this.\n\nFrom front view:\n\n- (0,0,0): Solid\n- (0,0,1): Solid\n- (1,0,0): Empty\n- (1,0,1): Solid\n\nFrom top view:\n\n- All (x, y, z) are solid.\n\nFrom right side view:\n\n- (0,0,0): Solid\n- (0,0,1): Solid\n- (0,1,0): Empty\n- (0,1,1): Empty\n\nSo, in the right side view, y=1 (back) is empty.\n\nBut from top view, all positions are solid, so (x, y, z) must be solid for all x, y, z.\n\nWait, but in the right side view, y=1 is empty, which suggests that in the back, the cubes are missing.\n\nBut from top view, all cubes are present. So, this is conflicting.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to adjust my coordinate system.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nLet me try to reconstruct the object.\n\nFrom front view:\n\n- The front face has a 2x2 grid, but the bottom right cube is missing.\n\nSo, in the front, we have:\n\nLeft column: Both cubes present.\n\nRight column: Top cube present, bottom cube missing.\n\nSo, from front, it's like:\n\nFront-Left-Top: Solid\n\nFront-Left-Bottom: Solid\n\nFront-Right-Top: Solid\n\nFront-Right-Bottom: Empty\n\nFrom top view:\n\nAll four cubes are present.\n\nSo, in the top view, both left and right columns, both top and bottom cubes are present.\n\nFrom right side view:\n\nTop two cubes (front and back) are solid, but the bottom two are empty.\n\nWait, no, the right side view shows:\n\nTop row: Solid\n\nBottom row: Empty\n\nSo, from the right, looking left, the top two cubes are solid, the bottom two are empty.\n\nSo, in terms of coordinates:\n\nLooking from the right (positive x), the y-axis is depth (front to back), and z-axis is height.\n\nSo, for y=0 (front), z=0 and z=1 are solid.\n\nFor y=1 (back), z=0 and z=1 are empty.\n\nBut from top view, all cubes are solid, so for y=1, z=0 and z=1 must be solid.\n\nThis is conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps the right side view is showing that in the right face, the top two cubes are solid, but the bottom two are empty.\n\nSo, the right face has:\n\nTop row: Solid\n\nBottom row: Empty\n\nBut from top view, all cubes are solid, so the right face must have cubes in both top and bottom.\n\nWait, maybe the right side view is indicating that the right face has only the top cubes solid, and the bottom is empty.\n\nBut from top view, the right face must have cubes in both top and bottom.\n\nThis is conflicting. So, perhaps the object is such that in the right face, the top is solid, but the bottom is empty, but from top view, it's solid.\n\nSo, how can that be?\n\nPerhaps the cubes in the right face, bottom row are present but not visible from the right side view.\n\nWait, no. In orthographic projections, each view shows the maximum extent along that axis.\n\nSo, if from the right, the bottom row is empty, but from top, it's solid, that suggests that the cubes are present but not aligned along the right direction.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I need to sketch this out.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the object as having a sort of overhang.\n\nFrom front view, the right column has only the top cube.\n\nFrom top view, all cubes are present, so the right column must have both top and bottom cubes.\n\nFrom right side view, the bottom cubes are empty, but the top are solid.\n\nSo, this suggests that the bottom cubes are present but not visible from the right side.\n\nWait, but in orthographic projection, if a cube is present, it should show up in the projection.\n\nUnless the cube is not aligned with the projection direction.\n\nWait, no. Orthographic projection shows the maximum extent along the axis. So, if a cube is present but not along the projection axis, it might not be visible.\n\nWait, no, actually, in orthographic projection, the view shows the maximum extent along that axis. So, if a cube is present but not along the projection axis, it would still be visible.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nLet me try to think differently.\n\nLet me assign coordinates again, with x (right-left), y (front-back), z (bottom-top).\n\nFront view: x=0 (left), x=1 (right)\n\nTop view: y=0 (front), y=1 (back)\n\nRight side view: z=0 (bottom), z=1 (top)\n\nFrom front view:\n\n- x=0, y=0, z=0: Solid\n\n- x=0, y=0, z=1: Solid\n\n- x=1, y=0, z=0: Empty\n\n- x=1, y=0, z=1: Solid\n\nFrom top view:\n\n- x=0, y=0, z=0: Solid\n\n- x=0, y=0, z=1: Solid\n\n- x=1, y=0, z=0: Solid\n\n- x=1, y=0, z=1: Solid\n\nFrom right side view:\n\nLooking from x=1 (right), the view shows:\n\n- y=0, z=0: Solid\n\n- y=0, z=1: Solid\n\n- y=1, z=0: Empty\n\n- y=1, z=1: Empty\n\nSo, from right side view, y=1 (back) is empty at both z=0 and z=1.\n\nBut from top view, y=1 (back) is solid at both z=0 and z=1.\n\nThis is a contradiction because the right side view shows y=1 as empty, but top view shows y=1 as solid.\n\nThis suggests that the cubes at y=1 are not aligned along the x-axis (right-left), so they are not visible from the right side view.\n\nWait, but in orthographic projection, if a cube is present but not along the projection direction, it should still be visible.\n\nWait, no, orthographic projection shows the silhouette, so if a cube is present but not along the projection direction, it would still cast a shadow.\n\nWait, perhaps the issue is that the cubes are not directly along the projection direction, but are present elsewhere.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think of the object as a kind of staircase or overhang.\n\nFrom front view, the right column has only the top cube.\n\nFrom top view, everything is solid.\n\nFrom right side view, the back cubes are missing, but the front cubes are solid.\n\nSo, perhaps the object has cubes in the front, left, and top positions, but not in the right and back positions.\n\nBut from top view, all positions are solid, so the right and back positions must have cubes.\n\nWait, but from right side view, the back is empty.\n\nThis is conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the object is a 2x2x2 cube missing some parts.\n\nWait, but from front view, the bottom right is missing.\n\nFrom right side view, the bottom back is missing.\n\nFrom top view, all are present.\n\nSo, maybe the object is a 2x2x2 cube with the bottom right and back cubes missing.\n\nBut wait, from top view, all are solid, so the bottom right and back must be solid.\n\nWait, I'm confused.\n\nLet me try to list all possible cubes.\n\nGiven that the top view is all solid, so all (x, y, z) where x=0,1; y=0,1; z=0,1 are solid.\n\nSo, 8 cubes in total.\n\nBut front view shows that (1,0,0) is empty, so the cube at x=1, y=0, z=0 is empty.\n\nSimilarly, right side view shows that (0,1,0) and (0,1,1) are empty, meaning that the back cubes at y=1 are empty.\n\nBut from top view, y=1 is solid, so the back cubes must be present.\n\nWait, but the right side view shows that y=1 is empty, which suggests that the back cubes are not present.\n\nBut from top view, y=1 is solid, so the back cubes must be present.\n\nThis is conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps the right side view is showing that the back cubes are not along the projection axis, so they are not visible.\n\nWait, no, orthographic projection shows the maximum extent along the projection direction.\n\nSo, if a cube is present at y=1, z=0, it should be visible from the right side view.\n\nBut the right side view shows that y=1 is empty.\n\nSo, this suggests that the cube at y=1, z=0 is not present.\n\nBut from top view, y=1, z=0 is solid.\n\nThis is conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I've misassigned the coordinate system.\n\nLet me try to assign y as depth (right to left), instead of front to back.\n\nSo, let me redefine:\n\nx: left to right\n\ny: right to left (depth)\n\nz: bottom to top\n\nThen, front view is x=0 (left), x=1 (right)\n\nTop view is y=0 (right), y=1 (left)\n\nRight side view is z=0 (bottom), z=1 (top)\n\nWait, no, that might not help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the right side view is showing the depth (y-axis) from front to back.\n\nSo, in the right side view, y=0 is front, y=1 is back.\n\nSimilarly, top view is y=0 is front, y=1 is back.\n\nSo, from the right side view, y=1 (back) is empty.\n\nBut from top view, y=1 (back) is solid.\n\nThis suggests that the back cubes are present but not visible from the right side.\n\nBut in orthographic projection, if a cube is present, it should be visible unless it's hidden.\n\nWait, maybe the cubes are stacked in such a way that they are not along the projection direction.\n\nWait, but in orthographic projection, the view shows the maximum extent along that axis, so if a cube is present, it would show up.\n\nWait, perhaps the object is not a solid block but a more complex shape.\n\nLet me try to think of it as a kind of overhang.\n\nFrom front view, the right column has only the top cube.\n\nFrom top view, everything is solid.\n\nFrom right side view, the back is empty.\n\nSo, perhaps the object has cubes on the front, left, and top, but not on the right and back.\n\nBut from top view, all cubes are present, so the right and back must have cubes.\n\nWait, but from right side view, the back is empty.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the object is a 2x2x2 cube with the front-right-bottom cube missing.\n\nBut from front view, that's correct.\n\nFrom top view, all are solid, so the front-right-bottom is missing, but the back-right-bottom is present.\n\nWait, but from right side view, the back is empty.\n\nWait, maybe the object is a 2x2x2 cube with the front-right-bottom and back-right-bottom cubes missing.\n\nBut then from top view, the right column would have two empty spaces, which contradicts the top view showing all solid.\n\nWait, no, because from top view, the right column is solid, so the right column must have cubes.\n\nSo, the front-right-bottom is missing, but the back-right-bottom is present.\n\nBut from right side view, the back is empty, which suggests that the back-right-bottom is missing.\n\nBut from top view, it's solid.\n\nThis is conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps the object is a 2x2x2 cube with the front-right-bottom and back-right-top cubes missing.\n\nBut then from front view, the front-right would have top missing, but from right side view, the back would be empty.\n\nBut from top view, the right column would have two cubes, but from right side view, the back is empty.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the object is a 2x2x2 cube with the front-right-bottom missing, and the back-right-top missing.\n\nBut then from front view, the front-right would have top missing, and from right side view, the back would be empty.\n\nBut from top view, the right column would have two cubes, but from right side view, the back is empty.\n\nWait, but the top view shows that all cubes are solid, so the back-right-top must be present.\n\nBut from right side view, the back is empty.\n\nThis is conflicting.\n\nI think I'm going in circles here.\n\nLet me try to approach it differently.\n\nLet me consider that the object has 8 cubes in total (since top view is 2x2 solid).\n\nFrom front view, one cube is missing:

End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: Three orthographic views (front, top, and right side) of a simple 3D object made of cubes are shown below:\n\nFront view:\n\u25a0 \u25a0\n\u25a0 \u25a1\n\nTop view:\n\u25a0 \u25a0\n\u25a0 \u25a0\n\nRight side view:\n\u25a0 \u25a0\n\u25a1 \u25a1\n\nWhere '\u25a0' represents a solid cube and '\u25a1' represents an empty space. How many cubes are used to create this 3D object? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this problem here with three orthographic views of a 3D object made up of cubes. The goal is to figure out how many cubes are used to create this object. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what each view represents. The front view, top view, and right side view each show a 2D projection of the 3D object. Each '\u25a0' is a solid cube, and each '\u25a1' is an empty space. So, the challenge is to visualize or maybe even sketch the 3D object based on these projections and then count the cubes.\n\nStarting with the front view:\n\n```\n\u25a0 \u25a0\n\u25a0 \u25a1\n```\n\nThis is a 2x2 grid. In the first row, both are cubes. In the second row, the first is a cube, and the second is empty. So, from the front, we can see 3 cubes.\n\nNext, the top view:\n\n```\n\u25a0 \u25a0\n\u25a0 \u25a0\n```\n\nThis is also a 2x2 grid, but from the top. All four positions are cubes. So, from the top, it looks like a solid 2x2 square. That suggests that in the top view, there are 4 cubes.\n\nBut wait, the front view only shows 3 cubes. How does that reconcile with the top view showing 4? Maybe the top view is a bit misleading because of the way orthographic projections work. Let me think. If from the front, I see 3 cubes, and from the top, I see 4, it could be that the fourth cube is behind the third one from the front view. So, the front view is hiding the fourth cube.\n\nOkay, that makes sense. So, in total, we might have 4 cubes.\n\nNow, the right side view:\n\n```\n\u25a0 \u25a0\n\u25a1 \u25a1\n```\n\nThis is a 2x2 grid again, but the first row has cubes, and the second row has empty spaces. So, from the right side, we can see 2 cubes.\n\nHmm, so from the front: 3 cubes, from the top: 4 cubes, and from the right: 2 cubes. How do these numbers fit together?\n\nLet me try to sketch this out mentally. Maybe I can build a mental model of the 3D object.\n\nFrom the front view, we have:\n\n```\nFront: \nRow 1: Cube, Cube\nRow 2: Cube, Empty\n```\n\nSo, the front face has a 2x2 grid with one empty space in the bottom right.\n\nFrom the top view, it's fully solid:\n\n```\nTop:\nRow 1: Cube, Cube\nRow 2: Cube, Cube\n```\n\nSo, the top is a solid 2x2.\n\nFrom the right side view, we see:\n\n```\nRight:\nRow 1: Cube, Cube\nRow 2: Empty, Empty\n```\n\nSo, the right face is only the top two cubes.\n\nPutting this together, let's think about the layers.\n\nAssuming the object is 2 units tall (since both front and top views are 2x2), and 2 units wide (since the front view is 2x2 as well). The right side view being 2x2 in the top row suggests that in the depth direction (from front to back), there's also a 2x2 structure.\n\nWait, that might complicate things. Let me try a different approach.\n\nPerhaps I can assign coordinates to each cube to figure out their positions.\n\nLet's consider a 3D coordinate system where the front view corresponds to the XY-plane, the top view corresponds to the XZ-plane, and the right side view corresponds to the YZ-plane.\n\nSo, each cube can be represented by its (X, Y, Z) coordinates, where:\n\n- X: Right to left (front to back)\n- Y: Up to down (left to right)\n- Z: Front to back (height)\n\nBut this might get a bit confusing. Maybe I should think about the layers.\n\nLet me consider the front view first. From the front, we have:\n\n```\nFront:\nRow 1: Cube (X=1, Y=1), Cube (X=2, Y=1)\nRow 2: Cube (X=1, Y=2), Empty (X=2, Y=2)\n```\n\nSo, in the front layer (Z=1), we have cubes at (1,1,1) and (2,1,1), and (1,2,1). The (2,2,1) is empty.\n\nFrom the top view, which is the XZ-plane, we see:\n\n```\nTop:\nRow 1: Cube (X=1, Z=1), Cube (X=2, Z=1)\nRow 2: Cube (X=1, Z=2), Cube (X=2, Z=2)\n```\n\nSo, in the top layer (Y=1), we have cubes at (1,1,1), (2,1,1), (1,1,2), and (2,1,2).\n\nWait, but in the front view, the Y=2, Z=1 cube is empty. So, that cube at (1,2,1) is actually not there. Therefore, in the top view, the cube at (1,1,2) is present, but the cube at (1,2,2) is not.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify.\n\nIn the top view, Y=1 corresponds to the entire front layer. So, if in the front view, Y=2, Z=1 is empty, that would mean that in the top view, the cube at (1,2,2) is not present. Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that each view shows the projection, and I need to find the maximum number of cubes that satisfy all three views.\n\nLet's think about the possible positions.\n\nFrom the front view:\n\n- At (X=1, Y=1, Z=1): Cube\n- (X=2, Y=1, Z=1): Cube\n- (X=1, Y=2, Z=1): Cube\n- (X=2, Y=2, Z=1): Empty\n\nFrom the top view:\n\n- At (X=1, Y=1, Z=1): Cube\n- (X=2, Y=1, Z=1): Cube\n- (X=1, Y=1, Z=2): Cube\n- (X=2, Y=1, Z=2): Cube\n\nFrom the right side view:\n\n- At (Y=1, Z=1, X=1): Cube\n- (Y=1, Z=1, X=2): Cube\n- (Y=2, Z=1, X=1): Empty\n- (Y=2, Z=1, X=2): Empty\n\nSo, combining these, we can see that:\n\n- The cube at (X=1, Y=1, Z=1) is present in all views.\n- The cube at (X=2, Y=1, Z=1) is present in front and top views, but in the right side view, Y=1, so it's present.\n- The cube at (X=1, Y=2, Z=1) is present in the front view but not in the right side view, so it must be hidden from the right side. That suggests it's at Z=1, Y=2, but since the right side view only shows Y=1 and Y=2 at Z=1, but it's empty, that cube is not present.\n- The cube at (X=2, Y=2, Z=1) is empty in the front view, so it's not there.\n- The cube at (X=1, Y=1, Z=2) is present in the top view but not in the front view. So, it's at Y=1, Z=2, which would be hidden from the front view. So, it's present.\n- The cube at (X=2, Y=1, Z=2) is present in the top view but not in the front view. So, it's at Y=1, Z=2, but since the front view shows Y=2 at Z=1 as empty, this cube is present but not visible from the front.\n\nWait, but in the right side view, at Y=1, Z=1, X=1 and X=2 are cubes. At Y=2, Z=1, X=1 and X=2 are empty. So, the cube at (X=1, Y=1, Z=2) would be at Y=1, Z=2, which is along the depth (X) direction. So, it's present but not seen from the right side because the right side view looks along the X-axis.\n\nSo, summarizing, the cubes present are:\n\n1. (X=1, Y=1, Z=1)\n2. (X=2, Y=1, Z=1)\n3. (X=1, Y=1, Z=2)\n4. (X=2, Y=1, Z=2)\n\nSo, that's 4 cubes.\n\nWait, but from the front view, we only see 3 cubes. So, how come in the top view, we see 4? Because the cube at (X=1, Y=1, Z=2) is behind the cube at (X=1, Y=2, Z=1) from the front view. So, in the front view, the cube at (X=1, Y=2, Z=1) is blocking the view of the cube at (X=1, Y=1, Z=2). Therefore, the front view only shows 3 cubes, while the top view shows 4 because it's looking along the Y-axis.\n\nSimilarly, the right side view shows 2 cubes because it's looking along the X-axis, and only the cubes at (Y=1, Z=1) are present.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the 3D object consists of 4 cubes.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIf I imagine looking at it from the front, I see 3 cubes. From the top, I see 4 because the fourth cube is elevated in the Z-direction, behind the front layer. From the right side, I see 2 cubes because the ones behind are hidden.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the total number of cubes used is 4.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the number of cubes, we analyze each view:\n\n1. **Front View**: 3 cubes.\n2. **Top View**: 4 cubes (since one is hidden from the front).\n3. **Right Side View**: 2 cubes.\n\nBy considering the overlaps and hidden cubes, the total is 4.\n\n**Answer:** 4 cubes are used. DONE."
