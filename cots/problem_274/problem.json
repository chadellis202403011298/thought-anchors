  "question": "Consider the analogy: 'Book is to Chapter as Year is to Month'. Following this pattern, which of the following correctly completes the analogy: 'House is to Room as...'\n\nA) Tree is to Forest\nB) Ocean is to Wave\nC) Forest is to Tree\nD) Song is to Verse",
  "answer": "The correct answer is D) Song is to Verse.\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to identify the relationship in the given analogy and find the pair that follows the same pattern.\n\nIn 'Book is to Chapter as Year is to Month':\n- A book is made up of multiple chapters; chapters are smaller constituent parts of a book.\n- A year is made up of multiple months; months are smaller constituent parts of a year.\n\nSo the relationship is 'whole to part' or 'larger unit to smaller constituent unit'.\n\nNow let's examine the relationship in 'House is to Room':\n- A house is made up of multiple rooms; rooms are smaller constituent parts of a house.\n\nWe need to find the option that shows the same 'whole to part' relationship:\n\nA) Tree is to Forest: This is reversed. A forest consists of many trees, so this would be 'part to whole'.\n\nB) Ocean is to Wave: This follows the pattern as an ocean contains many waves, but waves can also exist outside of oceans (in lakes, etc.), making this relationship less precise.\n\nC) Forest is to Tree: This is reversed. A forest consists of many trees, so this would be 'whole to part', not 'part to whole' as required.\n\nD) Song is to Verse: A song is made up of multiple verses; verses are smaller constituent parts of a song. This follows the 'whole to part' relationship.\n\nTherefore, D) Song is to Verse correctly completes the analogy."
