  "question": "You are in a room with a candle, a box of thumbtacks, and a book of matches. Your task is to mount the candle on the wall so that it can burn properly without dripping wax onto the floor below. How would you accomplish this?",
  "answer": "The solution is to use the box that holds the thumbtacks as a platform for the candle. Many people initially try to tack the candle directly to the wall or try melting the wax to stick it to the wall, which demonstrates functional fixedness\u2014seeing the thumbtack box only as a container for thumbtacks rather than as a potential shelf or platform.\n\nThe proper approach is to:\n1. Empty the thumbtacks from their box\n2. Use the thumbtacks to attach the empty box to the wall horizontally\n3. Place the candle on top of the box\n4. Light the candle with the matches\n\nThis solution requires overcoming functional fixedness by recognizing that the box can serve as a platform rather than just as a container. The key insight is seeing objects for their physical properties rather than just their conventional uses."
