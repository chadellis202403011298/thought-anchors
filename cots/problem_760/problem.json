  "question": "A woman lives on the 20th floor of an apartment building. Every morning, she takes the elevator down to the ground floor to go to work. In the evening, when she returns, she takes the elevator to the 10th floor and then walks up the stairs for the remaining 10 floors to her apartment. However, on rainy days or when there are other people in the elevator, she takes the elevator directly to the 20th floor. Why does she do this?",
  "answer": "The woman is too short to reach the button for the 20th floor in the elevator. She can only reach the buttons up to the 10th floor. On rainy days, she has her umbrella with her, which she can use to press the 20th floor button. Similarly, when other people are in the elevator, she can ask them to press the 20th floor button for her. This problem requires lateral thinking because it involves stepping outside conventional assumptions about why someone might take a partial elevator ride. Rather than assuming complex motivations like exercise or superstition, the simple physical limitation (height) explains the behavior pattern completely. The key insight comes from considering the unusual conditions (rainy days, other passengers) that allow her to overcome this limitation."
