  "question": "You are designing a new portable desk lamp and want to use Morphological Analysis to explore different design possibilities. Consider these four parameters and their possible values:\n\n1. Power Source: Battery, USB, Solar, Plug-in\n2. Light Type: LED, Fluorescent, Incandescent\n3. Adjustability: Fixed, Bendable Neck, Rotating Head, Fully Articulated\n4. Material: Plastic, Metal, Wood, Recycled\n\nIf you were to create a comprehensive morphological box of all possible combinations, how many different design concepts would you generate? Additionally, identify which specific combination would likely be most suitable for a student who needs an eco-friendly desk lamp for a dorm room with limited desk space and no nearby power outlets.",
  "answer": "Step 1: Calculate the total number of possible combinations in the morphological box.\nNumber of options for each parameter:\n- Power Source: 4 options (Battery, USB, Solar, Plug-in)\n- Light Type: 3 options (LED, Fluorescent, Incandescent)\n- Adjustability: 4 options (Fixed, Bendable Neck, Rotating Head, Fully Articulated)\n- Material: 4 options (Plastic, Metal, Wood, Recycled)\n\nTotal number of possible combinations = 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 4 = 192 different design concepts\n\nStep 2: Analyze the scenario for the student in a dorm room:\n- Limited desk space suggests a compact design\n- No nearby power outlets eliminates the Plug-in option\n- Eco-friendly requirement suggests considering renewable power and sustainable materials\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the parameters based on these constraints:\n- Power Source: Solar would be most eco-friendly and doesn't require outlets\n- Light Type: LED is the most energy-efficient option\n- Adjustability: Bendable Neck or Rotating Head would allow directing light while maintaining a small footprint; Bendable Neck may be more versatile\n- Material: Recycled material would be the most eco-friendly choice\n\nStep 4: Determine the most suitable combination:\nThe optimal design would be a Solar-powered LED lamp with a Bendable Neck made from Recycled materials.\n\nThis combination addresses all the requirements: it's eco-friendly (solar power, LED efficiency, recycled materials), doesn't require a power outlet, and the bendable neck allows for flexible positioning while maintaining a small footprint on the limited desk space."
