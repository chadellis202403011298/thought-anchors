  "question": "In a certain language, the words 'pik', 'rop', and 'tam' mean 'red', 'blue', and 'green', but not necessarily in that order. The following sentences are known to be true in this language:\n\n1. 'pik tam' means 'red green'\n2. 'tam rop' means 'green blue'\n\nWhat does each word mean in this language?",
  "answer": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which word corresponds to which color by analyzing the given translation clues.\n\nFrom clue 1: 'pik tam' means 'red green'\nFrom clue 2: 'tam rop' means 'green blue'\n\nStep 1: Since 'tam' appears in both translations, it must represent the color that appears in both translations. Looking at the color pairs:\n- 'red green' includes red and green\n- 'green blue' includes green and blue\nThe only color that appears in both translations is 'green'. Therefore, 'tam' means 'green'.\n\nStep 2: Now that we know 'tam' means 'green', we can determine the meanings of the other words.\nFrom clue 1: 'pik tam' means 'red green'\nSince 'tam' means 'green', 'pik' must mean 'red'.\n\nStep 3: From clue 2: 'tam rop' means 'green blue'\nSince 'tam' means 'green', 'rop' must mean 'blue'.\n\nTherefore:\n- 'pik' means 'red'\n- 'tam' means 'green'\n- 'rop' means 'blue'"
