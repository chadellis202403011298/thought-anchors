In other words, prove that 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2n-1) = n\u00b2. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I need to prove that the sum of the first n odd numbers equals n squared. Hmm, okay. Let me start by writing down what the problem is asking. It says that for any natural number n \u2265 1, the sum 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2n - 1) should equal n\u00b2. \n\nFirst, maybe I should try plugging in some small values of n to see if this holds true. That might give me an idea of what's going on. Let's start with n=1. Then the sum is just 1, and 1 squared is 1. Okay, that works. \n\nNext, n=2. The sum would be 1 + 3, which is 4, and 2 squared is also 4. Good, still holds. Let's try n=3. The sum is 1 + 3 + 5, which is 9, and 3 squared is 9. So far, so good. \n\nn=4: 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16, and 4\u00b2 is 16. Yep, that works too. Okay, so it seems to work for these small numbers. But I need to prove it for all natural numbers n \u2265 1, not just specific cases.\n\nHmm, how can I approach this? Maybe I can look for a pattern or a formula that relates the sum of odd numbers to a square. I remember that the sum of an arithmetic series can be calculated using a formula. Let me recall that. \n\nThe sum of the first k terms of an arithmetic series is given by S = k/2 * (first term + last term). In this case, the first term is 1, and the last term is (2n - 1). So, the sum S should be n/2 * (1 + (2n - 1)). Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, 1 + (2n - 1) is equal to 2n. So, S = n/2 * 2n. The 2s cancel out, so S = n\u00b2. Oh, that seems straightforward. Wait, is that all? Did I just find the formula and it simplifies directly to n squared?\n\nBut maybe I should double-check that. Let me write it out again. Sum of the first n odd numbers is S = 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2n - 1). This is an arithmetic series where the first term a = 1, the common difference d = 2 (since each term increases by 2). The number of terms is n. \n\nThe formula for the sum of an arithmetic series is S = n/2 * [2a + (n - 1)d]. Plugging in the values, we get S = n/2 * [2*1 + (n - 1)*2]. Let's compute inside the brackets: 2*1 is 2, and (n - 1)*2 is 2n - 2. Adding those together: 2 + 2n - 2 = 2n. So, S = n/2 * 2n = n\u00b2. Yep, that checks out.\n\nWait, but is there another way to think about this? Maybe visual or geometric? I remember something about arranging objects in a square. Let me see. If I have 1, 3, 5, etc., maybe I can pair them up or something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use induction. Mathematical induction is a common method for proving statements about natural numbers. Let me try that approach as well to confirm.\n\nSo, for induction, I need to show two things: the base case holds, and if it holds for some arbitrary natural number k, then it holds for k + 1.\n\nBase case: n = 1. The sum is 1, which is 1\u00b2. So, it holds.\n\nInductive step: Assume that for n = k, the sum of the first k odd numbers is k\u00b2. That is, 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k - 1) = k\u00b2.\n\nNow, let's consider n = k + 1. The sum becomes 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k - 1) + (2(k + 1) - 1) = k\u00b2 + (2k + 1).\n\nWait, no. Let me correct that. If I add the next odd number after the kth term, which is 2(k + 1) - 1 = 2k + 1, to the sum for n = k, which is k\u00b2, then the new sum is k\u00b2 + (2k + 1). \n\nBut according to the statement we're proving, the sum for n = k + 1 should be (k + 1)\u00b2. Let's compute (k + 1)\u00b2: that's k\u00b2 + 2k + 1. \n\nSo, indeed, the sum for n = k + 1 is k\u00b2 + (2k + 1) = (k + 1)\u00b2. Therefore, by induction, the statement holds for all natural numbers n \u2265 1.\n\nOkay, so both the direct formula and mathematical induction lead me to the conclusion that the sum of the first n odd numbers is n squared. That seems solid. I don't see any flaws in this reasoning. \n\nMaybe I can think of another way, like using telescoping series or something else. But honestly, the arithmetic series formula and induction seem sufficient. I think I'm confident enough that this proof is correct.\n</think>\n\nTo prove that for all natural numbers \\( n \\geq 1 \\), the sum of the first \\( n \\) odd numbers equals \\( n^2 \\), we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series and mathematical induction.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation and Proof:**\n\n1. **Identify the Series:**\n   The sum of the first \\( n \\) odd numbers is given by:\n   \\[\n   S = 1 + 3 + 5 + \\ldots + (2n - 1)\n   \\]\n   This is an arithmetic series where the first term \\( a = 1 \\), the common difference \\( d = 2 \\), and the number of terms \\( k = n \\).\n\n2. **Apply the Arithmetic Series Sum Formula:**\n   The sum of the first \\( k \\) terms of an arithmetic series is:\n   \\[\n   S = \\frac{k}{2} \\times [\\text{first term} + \\text{last term}]\n   \\]\n   Here, the first term is 1, and the last term is \\( 2n - 1 \\). Plugging in the values:\n   \\[\n   S = \\frac{n}{2} \\times [1 + (2n - 1)] = \\frac{n}{2} \\times 2n = n^2\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the sum of the first \\( n \\) odd numbers is \\( n^2 \\).\n\n3. **Alternative Proof Using Mathematical Induction:**\n   - **Base Case (\\( n = 1 \\)):**\n     \\[\n     1 = 1^2\n     \\]\n     The statement holds.\n   \n   - **Inductive Step:**\n     Assume the statement is true for \\( n = k \\), i.e.,\n     \\[\n     1 + 3 + 5 + \\ldots + (2k - 1) = k^2\n     \\]\n     For \\( n = k + 1 \\), the sum becomes:\n     \\[\n     1 + 3 + 5 + \\ldots + (2k - 1) + (2(k + 1) - 1) = k^2 + (2k + 1)\n     \\]\n     Simplifying the right-hand side:\n     \\[\n     k^2 + 2k + 1 = (k + 1)^2\n     \\]\n     Thus, the statement holds for \\( n = k + 1 \\).\n\n   By the principle of mathematical induction, the statement holds for all natural numbers \\( n \\geq 1 \\).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nFor every natural number \\( n \\geq 1 \\), the sum of the first \\( n \\) odd numbers is \\( n^2 \\).\n\nDONE."

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that odd numbers are numbers like 1, 3, 5, 7, and so on. So, the first few sums would be:\n\nFor n=1: 1 = 1\u00b2 = 1\nFor n=2: 1 + 3 = 4 = 2\u00b2\nFor n=3: 1 + 3 + 5 = 9 = 3\u00b2\nFor n=4: 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16 = 4\u00b2\n\nSo, it seems to hold for these small numbers. But I need to prove it for all natural numbers n \u2265 1.\n\nMaybe I can use mathematical induction? I think that's a common method for proving statements about natural numbers.\n\nAlright, let's recall how mathematical induction works. There are two steps: the base case and the inductive step.\n\n**Base Case:**\nFirst, I need to check if the statement holds for n=1.\n\nSum of the first 1 odd number: 1\nWhich equals 1\u00b2 = 1\n\nSo, the base case is true.\n\n**Inductive Step:**\nAssume that the statement is true for some arbitrary natural number k. That is, assume that:\n\n1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k - 1) = k\u00b2\n\nNow, I need to show that if the statement holds for n=k, it must also hold for n=k+1.\n\nSo, let's consider the sum up to n=k+1:\n\nSum = [1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k - 1)] + (2(k+1) - 1)\n\nFrom the inductive hypothesis, we know that the sum of the first k odd numbers is k\u00b2. So, substituting that in:\n\nSum = k\u00b2 + (2(k+1) - 1) = k\u00b2 + (2k + 2 - 1) = k\u00b2 + (2k + 1)\n\nNow, I need to simplify this expression and see if it equals (k+1)\u00b2.\n\nLet's expand (k+1)\u00b2:\n\n(k+1)\u00b2 = k\u00b2 + 2k + 1\n\nComparing this with our Sum expression:\n\nSum = k\u00b2 + 2k + 1 = (k+1)\u00b2\n\nSo, the sum for n=k+1 is indeed (k+1)\u00b2.\n\nSince both the base case holds and the inductive step holds, by mathematical induction, the statement is true for all natural numbers n \u2265 1.\n\nWait, but maybe I should try another approach just to double-check. Sometimes induction is straightforward, but there might be another way to visualize or understand why the sum of the first n odd numbers is a square.\n\nI remember something about pairing terms or using Gauss's approach. Let me try that.\n\nConsider writing the sum forwards and backwards:\n\n1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2n - 1)\n\nand\n\n(2n - 1) + (2n - 3) + ... + 3 + 1\n\nIf we add these two sums together, each pair of terms adds up to 2n. For example:\n\n1 + (2n - 1) = 2n\n3 + (2n - 3) = 2n\n...\nUp to the middle term.\n\nHow many such pairs are there? Since there are n terms in each sum, adding them gives 2n terms. But wait, no, actually, each sum has n terms, so when we add them, we have n pairs, each adding up to 2n. Therefore, the total sum is n * 2n = 2n\u00b2.\n\nBut wait, the original sum is only n terms, so the total sum is 2n\u00b2. But that doesn't make sense because the sum of the first n odd numbers is n\u00b2, not 2n\u00b2. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, no, actually, when we add the two sums, we get 2*(sum of the first n odd numbers). So, 2*(sum) = 2n\u00b2, which implies that the sum is n\u00b2. Ah, that makes sense!\n\nSo, by pairing the terms from the beginning and the end, we can see that the sum is n\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, both induction and pairing methods confirm that the sum of the first n odd numbers is n\u00b2. I think that's solid.\n</think>\n\nThe sum of the first n odd numbers is equal to n squared for all natural numbers n \u2265 1. This can be proven using mathematical induction or by pairing terms from the beginning and end of the sequence.\n\n**Proof Using Induction:**\n\n1. **Base Case (n=1):**\n   Sum = 1 = 1\u00b2\n   The statement holds.\n\n2. **Inductive Step:**\n   Assume for some k \u2265 1, the sum of the first k odd numbers is k\u00b2:\n   1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k - 1) = k\u00b2\n\n   For k+1:\n   Sum = [1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k - 1)] + (2(k+1) - 1)\n   = k\u00b2 + (2k + 1)\n   = k\u00b2 + 2k + 1\n   = (k + 1)\u00b2\n\n   Thus, the statement holds for k+1.\n\nBy induction, the sum of the first n odd numbers is n\u00b2 for all n \u2265 1.\n\n**Alternative Proof by Pairing:**\n\nWrite the sum forwards and backwards:\n1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2n - 1)\nand\n(2n - 1) + (2n - 3) + ... + 3 + 1\n\nAdding these:\n(1 + (2n - 1)) + (3 + (2n - 3)) + ... + ((2n - 1) + 1)\nEach pair sums to 2n, and there are n pairs:\nTotal = n * 2n = 2n\u00b2\n\nSince the original sum is n terms, we have:\nSum = n\u00b2\n\nThus, the sum of the first n odd numbers is n\u00b2.\n\nDONE."

Hmm, let me think about this step by step. \n\nFirst, I know that odd numbers are numbers like 1, 3, 5, 7, and so on. So, the first n odd numbers would be 1, 3, 5, ..., up to (2n-1). I need to add these up and show that the total is n\u00b2.\n\nMaybe I can start by writing out the sum for small values of n and see if I notice a pattern. Let's try n=1, n=2, n=3, etc.\n\nFor n=1: The sum is just 1. And 1\u00b2 is 1, so that works.\n\nFor n=2: The sum is 1 + 3 = 4. And 2\u00b2 is 4, so that's good.\n\nFor n=3: The sum is 1 + 3 + 5 = 9. And 3\u00b2 is 9, so that works too.\n\nn=4: 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16. 4\u00b2 is 16. Yep, that's matching.\n\nn=5: 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 = 25. 5\u00b2 is 25. So, it seems to hold for these small numbers.\n\nBut I need a general proof, not just examples. Maybe I can use induction. I remember that mathematical induction involves two steps: the base case and the inductive step.\n\nLet's start with the base case. For n=1, the sum is 1, which is equal to 1\u00b2. So, the base case holds.\n\nNow, for the inductive step, I assume that the statement is true for some arbitrary natural number k. That is, I assume that 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k-1) = k\u00b2.\n\nThen, I need to show that the statement holds for k+1, meaning that 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k-1) + (2(k+1)-1) = (k+1)\u00b2.\n\nBut wait, let's express the sum up to k+1 in terms of the sum up to k. The sum up to k+1 is the sum up to k plus the next odd number, which is (2(k+1)-1) = 2k+1.\n\nSo, Sum(k+1) = Sum(k) + (2k+1).\n\nFrom the induction hypothesis, Sum(k) = k\u00b2. Therefore, Sum(k+1) = k\u00b2 + 2k + 1.\n\nNow, let's see what (k+1)\u00b2 is. Expanding that, (k+1)\u00b2 = k\u00b2 + 2k + 1. So, Sum(k+1) equals (k+1)\u00b2, which means the statement holds for k+1.\n\nSince both the base case and the inductive step have been proven, by mathematical induction, the sum of the first n odd numbers is equal to n\u00b2 for all natural numbers n \u2265 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to think about this without induction. Let me consider the visual representation. If I arrange the odd numbers in a square, perhaps I can see a pattern.\n\nImagine drawing squares with sides made up of lines of odd numbers. For example:\n\n- A 1x1 square has just 1.\n- A 3x3 square has 1 + 3 on the first row, 5 + 7 on the second, and 9 on the third.\n- A 5x5 square has 1 + 3 + 5 on the first row, 7 + 9 + 11 on the second, 13 + 15 + 17 on the third, and 19 + 21 + 23 + 25 on the fourth, and so on.\n\nIf I add up all the numbers in each square, the total sum seems to be the square of the number of rows. For a 1x1 square, sum is 1=1\u00b2. For a 3x3 square, sum is 12, but wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, no, in a 3x3 square, the numbers are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17. Let me add them: 1+3=4, +5=9, +7=16, +9=25, +11=36, +13=49, +15=64, +17=81. But 81 is 9\u00b2, which is the square of the number of rows (3). Wait, but earlier when I added 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9, that was 25, which is 5\u00b2, but 5 is the number of rows. So, maybe each layer adds an odd number of rows, and the total sum is the square of the number of layers.\n\nHmm, perhaps this visual method isn't as straightforward as induction, but it might help in understanding why the sum relates to n\u00b2.\n\nAnother approach could be using arithmetic series. The sequence of odd numbers is an arithmetic sequence where the first term a1=1 and the common difference d=2. The nth term is a_n = 1 + (n-1)*2 = 2n - 1.\n\nThe sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic series is given by S_n = n/2 * (a1 + a_n). Plugging in the values, S_n = n/2 * (1 + (2n -1)) = n/2 * (2n) = n\u00b2.\n\nSo, that's another proof using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.\n\nI think the induction method is more straightforward for this problem, but it's good to see it from different angles. Both induction and the arithmetic series formula lead to the same conclusion, so I'm confident that the statement is true.\n</think>\n\nThe sum of the first n odd numbers is equal to n squared. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation and Proof:**\n\n1. **Understand the Problem:**\n   We need to prove that for any natural number \\( n \\geq 1 \\), the sum of the first n odd integers is equal to \\( n^2 \\).

Hmm, okay, let's start by understanding what the problem is asking. We have a sequence of odd numbers: 1, 3, 5, ..., up to (2n-1). I need to show that when you add all these together, the total is n\u00b2.\n\nFirst, maybe I should try plugging in some small values of n to see if the pattern holds. That might give me an idea of what's going on.\n\nLet's try n=1. The first odd number is just 1. So the sum is 1, and 1 squared is also 1. Okay, that works.\n\nNow n=2. The first two odd numbers are 1 and 3. Adding them gives 1+3=4. And 2 squared is 4. So that works too.\n\nn=3. The numbers are 1, 3, 5. Sum is 1+3+5=9, and 3 squared is 9. Good.\n\nn=4. 1+3+5+7=16, which is 4 squared. Okay, so it seems to hold for these small numbers. But I need a general proof, not just examples.\n\nHmm, how do I approach this? Maybe mathematical induction? That's a common method for proving statements about natural numbers.\n\nAlright, let's recall how mathematical induction works. There are two main steps: the base case and the inductive step. In the base case, I need to show that the statement holds for n=1. Then, in the inductive step, I assume it holds for some arbitrary natural number k, and then show that it must also hold for k+1.\n\nOkay, let's start with the base case.\n\n**Base Case (n=1):**\n\nThe sum of the first 1 odd number is just 1. So, 1 = 1\u00b2. That's true. So the base case holds.\n\n**Inductive Step:**\n\nAssume that the statement is true for some arbitrary natural number k. That is, assume that:\n\n1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k - 1) = k\u00b2.\n\nNow, I need to show that the statement also holds for k+1, meaning:\n\n1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k - 1) + (2(k+1) - 1) = (k+1)\u00b2.\n\nSimplify the left side of the equation for k+1:\n\n1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k - 1) + (2k + 1).\n\nFrom the inductive hypothesis, we know that the sum up to (2k - 1) is k\u00b2. So, adding (2k + 1) to both sides gives:\n\nk\u00b2 + (2k + 1).\n\nNow, let's compute (k + 1)\u00b2:\n\n(k + 1)\u00b2 = k\u00b2 + 2k + 1.\n\nWait, that's exactly what we have on the left side after adding the next odd number! So,\n\nk\u00b2 + (2k + 1) = (k + 1)\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, the statement holds for k+1.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nSince the base case holds and the inductive step holds, by mathematical induction, the sum of the first n odd numbers is equal to n\u00b2 for all natural numbers n \u2265 1.\n\nWait, let me double-check my inductive step. I assumed the sum up to k is k\u00b2, then adding the next term, which is 2(k+1)-1 = 2k +1. So, k\u00b2 + 2k +1 = (k+1)\u00b2. That looks correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to think about this without induction. Like, visualizing the sum of odd numbers as squares or something. I remember something about pairing terms or using geometry.\n\nLet me try another approach. Consider the sequence of odd numbers: 1, 3, 5, ..., (2n-1). Let's write them down and see if there's a pattern in their sum.\n\n1\n1 + 3 = 4\n4 + 5 = 9\n9 + 7 = 16\n16 + 9 = 25\n...\n\nWait, that's interesting. Each time I add the next odd number, the total becomes a perfect square. So, the sum after the first term is 1, which is 1\u00b2. After adding 3, it's 4, which is 2\u00b2. Adding 5 makes it 9, which is 3\u00b2. Adding 7 makes it 16, which is 4\u00b2, and so on.\n\nSo, it seems like each time we add the next odd number, we're increasing the square by 2k +1, but that's getting a bit abstract. Maybe there's a more straightforward geometric interpretation.\n\nImagine drawing squares with side lengths increasing by 1 each time. The area of a square with side length n is n\u00b2. If I can show that the sum of the odd numbers up to (2n-1) corresponds to the area of such a square, that might help.\n\nAlternatively, think about the sum of the first n odd numbers as forming a square. Each odd number can be represented as 2k -1 for k from 1 to n. So, the sum S = \u03a3_{k=1}^n (2k -1).\n\nLet me compute this sum algebraically.\n\nS = \u03a3_{k=1}^n (2k -1) = 2 \u03a3_{k=1}^n k - \u03a3_{k=1}^n 1.\n\nWe know that \u03a3_{k=1}^n k = n(n +1)/2, and \u03a3_{k=1}^n 1 = n.\n\nSo, substituting these in:\n\nS = 2*(n(n +1)/2) - n = n(n +1) - n = n\u00b2 + n - n = n\u00b2.\n\nThere we go! That's another way to see it algebraically without induction. So, the sum of the first n odd numbers is n squared.\n\nI think both methods are valid. The induction is more of a step-by-step proof, while the algebraic approach directly computes the sum. Either way, the result holds true.\n</think>\n\nThe sum of the first n odd numbers is equal to n squared. This can be proven using mathematical induction or by directly computing the sum algebraically.\n\n**Proof Using Mathematical Induction:**\n\n1. **Base Case (n=1):**\n   The sum of the first 1 odd number is 1, which equals 1\u00b2.

End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: Prove that for all natural numbers n \u2265 1, the sum of the first n odd numbers equals n\u00b2. In other words, prove that 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2n-1) = n\u00b2. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this problem: I need to prove that the sum of the first n odd numbers is equal to n squared. That is, 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2n - 1) = n\u00b2. Hmm, okay. I remember hearing something about this before, maybe in a math class or online. I think it's called something like the \"odd number theorem\" or maybe it's related to Gauss's trick? Not sure, but let me try to figure it out.\n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. We're talking about adding up the first n odd numbers. So, for example, if n is 1, the sum is just 1. If n is 2, it's 1 + 3 = 4, which is 2 squared. For n=3, it's 1 + 3 + 5 = 9, which is 3 squared. Okay, that seems to hold for these small numbers. But I need to prove it for all natural numbers n \u2265 1.\n\nHmm, how should I approach this? Maybe I can use mathematical induction since it's a statement about all natural numbers. Induction often works well for proofs that need to hold for all cases.\n\nAlright, let's recall how mathematical induction works. There are two main steps: the base case and the inductive step. In the base case, I need to show that the statement holds for n=1. Then, in the inductive step, I assume it holds for some arbitrary natural number k and show that it must then hold for k+1.\n\nLet's start with the base case. When n=1, the sum is just 1. And 1 squared is also 1. So, 1=1\u00b2. That checks out. Base case is proven.\n\nNow, for the inductive step. Let's assume that the statement is true for n=k. That means 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k - 1) = k\u00b2. Now, I need to show that the same statement holds for n=k+1, which would be 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k - 1) + (2(k+1) - 1). Simplifying that, it's 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k - 1) + (2k + 1).\n\nBut wait, from the induction hypothesis, we know that 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k - 1) = k\u00b2. So, substituting that in, the sum becomes k\u00b2 + (2k + 1). Now, I need to show that this equals (k+1)\u00b2.\n\nLet's compute (k+1)\u00b2. That's k\u00b2 + 2k + 1. So, we have k\u00b2 + (2k + 1) on one side and (k+1)\u00b2 = k\u00b2 + 2k + 1 on the other. They look identical! Therefore, the sum up to n=k+1 is indeed (k+1)\u00b2. So, by induction, the statement holds for all natural numbers n \u2265 1.\n\nWait, did I just do that correctly? Let me double-check. Starting with the assumption for n=k, adding the next odd number, which is 2(k+1)-1 = 2k + 1. Then, the total sum becomes k\u00b2 + 2k + 1, which is (k+1)\u00b2. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to think about it without induction. I remember something about pairing terms or maybe visualizing it. Let me try that approach.\n\nSuppose I write the sum forwards and backwards and then add them together. So, writing the sum S = 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2n - 1). If I write it backwards, it's S = (2n - 1) + (2n - 3) + ... + 3 + 1. Then, adding these two equations together term by term:\n\nFirst term: 1 + (2n - 1) = 2n\nSecond term: 3 + (2n - 3) = 2n\nThird term: 5 + (2n - 5) = 2n\n...\nLast term: (2n - 1) + 1 = 2n\n\nSo, each pair adds up to 2n, and there are n such pairs. Therefore, the total sum is n * 2n = 2n\u00b2. Wait, that's not matching the original statement. Hmm, did I make a mistake here?\n\nWait, no. If S = 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2n - 1), then when I add S and S reversed, I get 2S = n * 2n = 2n\u00b2. Therefore, S = n\u00b2. Oh, that works! So, that's another way to see it. Cool, so that method also proves it.\n\nBut wait, why does this pairing method work? It seems a bit magical. Let me think about it. By writing the sum forwards and backwards, I'm essentially creating pairs where each pair adds up to 2n. And since there are n terms, the total sum becomes n * 2n = 2n\u00b2. But wait, that seems to give 2n\u00b2, not n\u00b2. Hmm, did I make a mistake here?\n\nWait, no. Let me recast it. Let's say n is 3. Then, S = 1 + 3 + 5 = 9. According to the pairing method, S = n\u00b2. So, 3\u00b2 = 9. But when I add S + reversed S, I get (1+5) + (3+3) = 6 + 6 = 12. Then, 12 = 2S, so S = 6. But that's not correct because S should be 9. Hmm, so where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, maybe I misapplied the pairing. Let me try again. For n=3, S = 1 + 3 + 5 = 9. Reversed S is 5 + 3 + 1 = 9. Adding them: 9 + 9 = 18. Now, 18 = 2S => S = 9. Oh, okay, so it works. So, in this case, 2S = 18, so S = 9. Got it.\n\nSo, in general, 2S = sum of all pairs, which is n * (first term + last term)/2 * 2? Wait, no. Let me think differently.\n\nEach pair adds up to 2n, and there are n pairs. So, 2S = n * 2n = 2n\u00b2, hence S = n\u00b2. That makes sense.\n\nWait, but in the specific case of n=3, 2S = 18, which is 3*2*3=18, so S=9. Yes, that works. So, in general, 2S = n * 2n = 2n\u00b2, so S = n\u00b2.\n\nOkay, that method checks out. So, I have two different proofs: one using induction and another using the pairing method. Both lead to the conclusion that the sum of the first n odd numbers is n squared.\n\nI think that's solid. Maybe I can also try a visual approach. If I arrange the odd numbers in a certain way, maybe I can see a pattern. For example, if I write them in a square formation, each row and column might sum up to n\u00b2. But I'm not sure if that's necessary since I already have two algebraic proofs.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the sequence of odd numbers and how they relate to squares. Each odd number can be represented as 2k - 1, where k is the term number. So, the sum becomes the sum from k=1 to n of (2k - 1). Let's compute that:\n\nSum = \u03a3 (2k - 1) from k=1 to n = 2\u03a3k - \u03a31 from k=1 to n = 2*(n(n+1)/2) - n = n(n+1) - n = n\u00b2 + n - n = n\u00b2.\n\nYes, that's another way to see it. By breaking the sum into two separate sums, we can compute each part and then combine them. That also gives the result directly.\n\nSo, multiple methods confirm that the sum is n squared. I think I'm confident enough that this is a valid proof. Maybe I can also test it with a few more examples to be sure.\n\nLet's try n=4. The sum should be 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16, which is 4\u00b2. Using the pairing method: 1 + 7 = 8, 3 + 5 = 8. So, 8 + 8 = 16, which is 2S. Therefore, S=8, but wait, that's not right because S should be 16. Wait, no, wait. If S = 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16, then 2S = 32. But according to the pairing, 1+7=8, 3+5=8, so 8+8=16, which is S, not 2S. Hmm, so I must have made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, no. For n=4, S=16. When I add S and reversed S, I get 16 + 16 = 32, which is 2S. So, 2S=32 => S=16. That works. So, in general, 2S = sum of the pairs, which is n*(first term + last term)/2 * 2? Wait, no. Each pair adds up to 2n, and there are n pairs, so 2S = n*2n = 2n\u00b2, hence S = n\u00b2.\n\nWait, but in the n=4 case, each pair is 8, and there are 4 pairs? No, wait, n=4, the number of terms is 4, so the number of pairs is 4, each pair adding to 8. So, 4*8=32=2S, hence S=16. That works. So, the general formula is 2S = n*(first + last)/2 * 2? Wait, no. Let me clarify.\n\nEach pair adds to 2n, and there are n pairs. So, 2S = n*(2n) = 2n\u00b2. Therefore, S = n\u00b2. That's the correct reasoning.\n\nSo, in the n=4 case, each pair is 8, which is 2*4=8. There are 4 pairs, so 4*8=32=2S => S=16. That matches. So, the general method holds.\n\nI think I've got a good handle on this now. Both induction and the pairing method work, and breaking down the sum into separate sums also leads to the conclusion. Plus, testing with specific examples confirms it. So, I can confidently say that the sum of the first n odd numbers is indeed n squared.\n</think>\n\nTo prove that the sum of the first \\( n \\) odd numbers equals \\( n^2 \\), we can use mathematical induction or the pairing method. Here's a step-by-step proof using induction:\n\n**Base Case (\\( n = 1 \\)):**\nThe sum of the first 1 odd number is \\( 1 \\), and \\( 1^2 = 1 \\).

That is, 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2n-1) = n\u00b2. Hmm, interesting. I remember hearing something about this in school, maybe in geometry or algebra. Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, let's make sure I understand the problem correctly. We're adding up a sequence of odd numbers. The first term is 1, the second is 3, the third is 5, and so on, up to the nth term, which is (2n - 1). So, for example, if n is 1, the sum is just 1. If n is 2, it's 1 + 3 = 4. If n is 3, it's 1 + 3 + 5 = 9, and so on. Yeah, that seems right. So, 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2n-1) should equal n\u00b2.\n\nAlright, so how do I approach proving this? Well, I know that mathematical induction is a common method for proving statements about natural numbers. Maybe I can try that. Alternatively, I could look for a pattern or use some sort of algebraic manipulation. Let me think about both approaches.\n\nFirst, let's consider mathematical induction because it's a systematic way to prove statements for all natural numbers. The process involves two steps: the base case and the inductive step.\n\nBase Case: Let's start with n = 1. The sum is just 1, and 1\u00b2 is also 1. So, 1 = 1, which checks out. That means the base case holds.\n\nInductive Step: Now, assume that the statement is true for some arbitrary natural number k. That is, assume that 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k - 1) = k\u00b2. This is our inductive hypothesis.\n\nNext, we need to show that the statement holds for k + 1. That is, we need to prove that 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k - 1) + (2(k + 1) - 1) = (k + 1)\u00b2.\n\nLet's write that out: 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k - 1) + (2k + 1) = (k + 1)\u00b2.\n\nFrom our inductive hypothesis, we know that the sum up to (2k - 1) is k\u00b2. So, substituting that in, we have:\n\nk\u00b2 + (2k + 1) = (k + 1)\u00b2.\n\nNow, let's compute the right-hand side: (k + 1)\u00b2 = k\u00b2 + 2k + 1.\n\nSo, we have:\n\nk\u00b2 + (2k + 1) = k\u00b2 + 2k + 1.\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nk\u00b2 + 2k + 1 = k\u00b2 + 2k + 1.\n\nThis is a true statement, so the inductive step holds. Therefore, by mathematical induction, the sum of the first n odd numbers is equal to n\u00b2 for all natural numbers n \u2265 1.\n\nWait, but maybe I should try another approach to confirm this result. Sometimes, induction is straightforward, but there might be another way to see why this is true.\n\nLet me think about the sequence of odd numbers. Each odd number can be expressed as 2m - 1, where m is a natural number. So, the first odd number is when m = 1: 2(1) - 1 = 1, the second is 2(2) - 1 = 3, and so on. So, the nth odd number is 2n - 1.\n\nSo, the sum S = 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2n - 1).\n\nI recall that there's a formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. The sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic series is given by S = n/2 * (first term + last term). In this case, the first term is 1, and the last term is (2n - 1). So, plugging those in:\n\nS = n/2 * (1 + (2n - 1)).\n\nLet's compute that:\n\n1 + (2n - 1) = 2n.\n\nSo, S = n/2 * 2n = n\u00b2.\n\nThere we go, that's another way to see it. The sum of the first n odd numbers is indeed n squared. So, both induction and the arithmetic series formula lead to the same conclusion.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me test this with a few small values of n to make sure it holds.\n\nFor n = 1: 1 = 1\u00b2 = 1. Correct.\n\nFor n = 2: 1 + 3 = 4 = 2\u00b2. Correct.\n\nFor n = 3: 1 + 3 + 5 = 9 = 3\u00b2. Correct.\n\nFor n = 4: 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16 = 4\u00b2. Correct.\n\nOkay, so it seems to work for these small cases. That gives me more confidence in the proof.\n\nI also remember something about pairing terms in a sequence to find a pattern. Let me try that.\n\nConsider the sum: 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2n - 1).\n\nIf I write them down and try to add them in a different way, maybe I can see a square formation. For example:\n\n1\n\n3\n\n5\n\n...\n\n(2n - 1)\n\nIf I arrange these numbers in a square, like a magic square or something, maybe the sum can be visualized as n\u00b2.\n\nAlternatively, think of the square of a number. Let's take n = 3 again. 3\u00b2 is 9, and the sum is 1 + 3 + 5 = 9. If I write the numbers 1, 3, 5 in a triangle, maybe it forms a square.\n\nWait, another approach I remember is that the sum of the first n odd numbers is a square because each odd number can be represented as a difference of squares. Let me think about that.\n\nEach odd number can be written as (k + 1)\u00b2 - k\u00b2, where k is a natural number. For example:\n\n(1 + 1)\u00b2 - 1\u00b2 = 4 - 1 = 3.\n\n(2 + 1)\u00b2 - 2\u00b2 = 9 - 4 = 5.\n\n(3 + 1)\u00b2 - 3\u00b2 = 16 - 9 = 7.\n\nSo, each odd number is a difference of two consecutive squares. Therefore, the sum of the first n odd numbers can be written as:\n\nSum = \u03a3 [(k + 1)\u00b2 - k\u00b2] from k = 1 to n.\n\nLet's compute this sum:\n\nWhen k = 1: (2)\u00b2 - (1)\u00b2 = 4 - 1 = 3\n\nWhen k = 2: (3)\u00b2 - (2)\u00b2 = 9 - 4 = 5\n\n...\n\nWhen k = n: (n + 1)\u00b2 - n\u00b2 = (n\u00b2 + 2n + 1) - n\u00b2 = 2n + 1.\n\nSo, the sum becomes:\n\n(4 - 1) + (9 - 4) + (16 - 9) + ... + (n\u00b2 + 2n + 1 - n\u00b2)\n\nEach term cancels out except for the last term, which is (n + 1)\u00b2. So, the sum simplifies to:\n\n(n + 1)\u00b2 - 1.\n\nBecause the intermediate terms cancel each other out. Wait, let's see:\n\nSum = (2\u00b2 - 1\u00b2) + (3\u00b2 - 2\u00b2) + (4\u00b2 - 3\u00b2) + ... + ((n + 1)\u00b2 - n\u00b2)\n\nEach negative term cancels with the positive term of the next fraction:\n\n-1\u00b2 + 2\u00b2 - 2\u00b2 + 3\u00b2 - 3\u00b2 + ... - n\u00b2 + (n + 1)\u00b2\n\nSo, everything cancels except for -1\u00b2 and (n + 1)\u00b2. Therefore, Sum = (n + 1)\u00b2 - 1.\n\nBut wait, that's not matching our earlier result. Earlier, we had Sum = n\u00b2. So, there's a discrepancy here. Let me check my reasoning.\n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake in the cancellation. Let's write out the terms:\n\nSum = (2\u00b2 - 1\u00b2) + (3\u00b2 - 2\u00b2) + (4\u00b2 - 3\u00b2) + ... + ((n + 1)\u00b2 - n\u00b2)\n\nSo, expanding each term:\n\n= (4 - 1) + (9 - 4) + (16 - 9) + ... + ( (n + 1)\u00b2 - n\u00b2 )\n\nNow, let's list all the terms:\n\n= 4 - 1 + 9 - 4 + 16 - 9 + ... + (n\u00b2 + 2n + 1) - n\u00b2\n\nNow, let's see which terms cancel:\n\nThe -1 remains.\n\n+4 -4 cancels.\n\n+9 -9 cancels.\n\n...\n\nUp to the penultimate term, which would be -(n\u00b2 - (n - 1)\u00b2) or something like that. Wait, actually, each positive term after the first cancels with a negative term two steps ahead.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to consider that all the intermediate terms cancel out, leaving only the last positive term and the first negative term.\n\nSo, Sum = (n + 1)\u00b2 - 1.\n\nBut that would mean Sum = n\u00b2 + 2n + 1 - 1 = n\u00b2 + 2n.\n\nWait, that contradicts our earlier result where Sum = n\u00b2.\n\nHmm, where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, let's go back. Maybe I misapplied the method. Let me try again.\n\nEach odd number is (k + 1)\u00b2 - k\u00b2, so the sum from k = 1 to n is:\n\nSum = \u03a3 [(k + 1)\u00b2 - k\u00b2] from k=1 to n.\n\nExpanding that, it's:\n\n(2\u00b2 - 1\u00b2) + (3\u00b2 - 2\u00b2) + (4\u00b2 - 3\u00b2) + ... + ((n + 1)\u00b2 - n\u00b2).\n\nNow, writing this out, each term is (m\u00b2 - (m - 1)\u00b2) where m goes from 2 to n + 1.\n\nSo, expanding each term:\n\n= (4 - 1) + (9 - 4) + (16 - 9) + ... + ( (n + 1)\u00b2 - n\u00b2 )\n\nNow, let's see the cancellation:\n\n-1 from the first term.\n\n+4 from the first term, which cancels with -4 from the second term.\n\n+9 from the second term, which cancels with -9 from the third term.\n\nAnd so on, until the last term, which is (n + 1)\u00b2.\n\nSo, after cancellation, we're left with:\n\n(n + 1)\u00b2 - 1.\n\nBut according to this, Sum = (n + 1)\u00b2 - 1.\n\nWait, that's not equal to n\u00b2. So, there's a problem here. Maybe I made a mistake in setting up the sum.\n\nWait, the sum of the first n odd numbers is 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2n - 1). So, the last term is (2n - 1), which is equal to (n + 1)\u00b2 - n\u00b2? Let's check:\n\n(n + 1)\u00b2 - n\u00b2 = (n\u00b2 + 2n + 1) - n\u00b2 = 2n + 1, which is indeed the nth odd number.\n\nSo, the sum from k=1 to n of [(k + 1)\u00b2 - k\u00b2] is the sum of the first n odd numbers, which is n\u00b2.\n\nBut when we expanded it, we got (n + 1)\u00b2 - 1.\n\nWait, that can't be right because for n=1, (n + 1)\u00b2 -1 = 4 -1=3, but the sum is 1.\n\nHmm, so clearly, something is wrong here. Maybe my initial assumption that each odd number is (k + 1)\u00b2 - k\u00b2 is correct, but the sum is not equal to (n + 1)\u00b2 - 1. Let me check for n=1:\n\nSum =1. (n +1)\u00b2 -1=4-1=3\u22601. So, that's wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I misapplied the formula. Let me see.\n\nIf each odd number is (k + 1)\u00b2 - k\u00b2, then the sum from k=1 to n is:\n\nSum = \u03a3 [(k + 1)\u00b2 - k\u00b2] from k=1 to n.\n\nWhich is equal to (2\u00b2 -1\u00b2)+(3\u00b2-2\u00b2)+(4\u00b2-3\u00b2)+...+((n+1)\u00b2 -n\u00b2).\n\nWhen we write this out, it's 4 -1 +9 -4 +16 -9 +...+(n\u00b2 + 2n +1) -n\u00b2.\n\nNow, the terms -1, +4, -4, +9, -9,... cancel out except for the first -1 and the last (n\u00b2 + 2n +1).\n\nSo, Sum = (n\u00b2 + 2n +1) -1 = n\u00b2 + 2n.\n\nWait, but that contradicts the earlier result where Sum = n\u00b2.\n\nSo, where is the mistake here?\n\nWait, no, because for n=1, Sum=1, but according to this, Sum=1\u00b2 +2*1=3, which is wrong.\n\nHmm, so perhaps this approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm not considering that the sum is only up to (2n -1), which is the nth odd number. So, maybe the last term is (n +1)\u00b2 -n\u00b2, but the sum is up to that term.\n\nWait, but when I sum from k=1 to n, I get (n +1)\u00b2 -1, which is not equal to n\u00b2. So, that suggests that this approach is flawed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial step is wrong. Let me think differently.\n\nInstead of expressing each odd number as a difference of squares, perhaps I should think of the entire sum as a telescoping series. Let me try that.\n\nExpress each odd number as (k + 1)\u00b2 - k\u00b2, where k starts from 1 and goes up to n.\n\nSo, Sum = \u03a3 [(k +1)\u00b2 -k\u00b2] from k=1 to n.\n\nExpanding this, it's:\n\n(2\u00b2 -1\u00b2) + (3\u00b2 -2\u00b2) + (4\u00b2 -3\u00b2) + ... + ((n +1)\u00b2 -n\u00b2).\n\nNow, when we write out the terms:\n\n4 -1 +9 -4 +16 -9 +... + (n\u00b2 + 2n +1) -n\u00b2.\n\nNow, let's see which terms cancel:\n\n-1 remains.\n\n+4 cancels with -4.\n\n+9 cancels with -9.\n\n...\n\nUp to the term before the last, which is - (n\u00b2 - (n -1)\u00b2).\n\nWait, but the last term is (n\u00b2 + 2n +1) -n\u00b2 = 2n +1.\n\nSo, the sum becomes:\n\n(n\u00b2 + 2n +1) -1 = n\u00b2 + 2n.\n\nWait, that's not matching the desired result. Hmm.\n\nWait, but for n=1, this gives 1 +2=3, which is wrong because the sum is 1.\n\nSo, something's wrong here. Maybe the initial expression is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I should adjust the expression. Let me check for n=1:\n\nSum=1.\n\nExpressed as (1 +1)\u00b2 -1\u00b2=4 -1=3, which is not equal to 1.\n\nSo, that's incorrect. Therefore, my initial assumption that each odd number can be expressed as (k +1)\u00b2 -k\u00b2 for k from 1 to n is wrong.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that 3=2\u00b2 -1\u00b2, 5=3\u00b2 -2\u00b2, etc. So, that seems correct.\n\nBut when I sum them up, it's giving me (n +1)\u00b2 -1, which is not equal to n\u00b2.\n\nSo, perhaps this approach is not the right way to go.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the sum of the first n odd numbers is n\u00b2, so perhaps there's another way to see it.\n\nLet me think about the sequence of odd numbers arranged in a square.\n\nFor example, n=1: 1\n\nn=2: 1 3\n\nn=3: 1 3 5\n\nn=4: 1 3 5 7\n\nIf I arrange these numbers in a square, maybe it forms a square of size n x n, which would have area n\u00b2.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, for n=3, arranging the numbers 1,3,5 in a triangle might form a square of side 3.\n\nWait, let me try writing them in a square:\n\n1\n\n3\n\n5\n\nBut that's a triangle, not a square. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, think of the numbers as forming a square when you consider their positions.\n\nWait, another idea: the sum of the first n odd numbers can be represented as the sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic series where the first term a1=1 and the common difference d=2.\n\nThe formula for the sum of an arithmetic series is S_n = n/2 * (2a1 + (n -1)d).\n\nPlugging in a1=1 and d=2:\n\nS_n = n/2 * (2*1 + (n -1)*2) = n/2 * (2 + 2n -2) = n/2 * (2n) = n\u00b2.\n\nYes, that works.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula S_n = n/2 * (a1 + an).\n\nWhere an is the nth term, which is 2n -1.\n\nSo, S_n = n/2 * (1 + (2n -1)) = n/2 * (2n) = n\u00b2.\n\nYes, that's another way to see it.\n\nSo, both methods confirm that the sum is n squared.\n\nI think I confused myself earlier with the telescoping series approach, but now I see that the arithmetic series formula is a more straightforward way to derive the result.\n\nSo, to recap, using mathematical induction, I proved that the sum of the first n odd numbers is n\u00b2. Additionally, using the arithmetic series formula, I arrived at the same conclusion. Both methods"

In other words, prove that 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2n-1) = n\u00b2. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I need to prove that the sum of the first n odd numbers equals n squared. That is, 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2n - 1) = n\u00b2. Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, maybe I should write down what the sum looks like for small values of n to see if I can spot a pattern or come up with a hypothesis.\n\nFor n = 1: 1 = 1\u00b2 \u2192 1 = 1. That works.\n\nFor n = 2: 1 + 3 = 4, which is 2\u00b2. Good.\n\nFor n = 3: 1 + 3 + 5 = 9, which is 3\u00b2. Still holds.\n\nn = 4: 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16, and 4\u00b2 is 16. Yep.\n\nSo it seems to hold for these small numbers. But I need a general proof, not just checking cases.\n\nI remember that sometimes mathematical induction is used for proofs involving natural numbers. Maybe I can try that.\n\nOkay, so mathematical induction requires two steps: the base case and the inductive step.\n\nBase case: n = 1.\n\nSum = 1, and 1\u00b2 = 1. So base case holds.\n\nInductive step: Assume that for some arbitrary natural number k, the sum of the first k odd numbers is k\u00b2. That is, 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k - 1) = k\u00b2.\n\nNow, I need to show that the sum up to k + 1 odd numbers is (k + 1)\u00b2.\n\nSo, the sum up to k + 1 is the sum up to k plus the next odd number, which would be (2(k + 1) - 1) = 2k + 1.\n\nSo, Sum(k + 1) = Sum(k) + (2k + 1).\n\nBy the induction hypothesis, Sum(k) = k\u00b2. Therefore, Sum(k + 1) = k\u00b2 + 2k + 1.\n\nHmm, that expression looks familiar. k\u00b2 + 2k + 1 is equal to (k + 1)\u00b2.\n\nSo, Sum(k + 1) = (k + 1)\u00b2, which is exactly what we needed to prove.\n\nTherefore, by mathematical induction, the sum of the first n odd numbers is n\u00b2 for all natural numbers n \u2265 1.\n\nWait, did I just do that correctly? Let me double-check.\n\nBase case: n = 1, 1 = 1\u00b2. Correct.\n\nInductive step: Assume true for n = k, so Sum(k) = k\u00b2. Then Sum(k + 1) = Sum(k) + (2k + 1) = k\u00b2 + 2k + 1 = (k + 1)\u00b2. That seems right.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the proof by induction works here.\n\nAlternatively, I also recall that there's a formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. Maybe I can use that approach.\n\nThe sum of an arithmetic series is given by (number of terms)/2 * (first term + last term).\n\nIn this case, the first term is 1, and the last term is (2n - 1). The number of terms is n because we're adding the first n odd numbers.\n\nSo, Sum = n/2 * (1 + (2n - 1)) = n/2 * (2n) = n * n = n\u00b2.\n\nYes, that's another way to see it. The formula for the sum of an arithmetic series directly gives us n\u00b2.\n\nSo, whether I use induction or the arithmetic series formula, both methods confirm that the sum of the first n odd numbers is n squared.\n\nI think that covers it. Both methods are valid, and they reinforce each other. So I'm confident that the statement is true.\n</think>\n\nTo prove that the sum of the first n odd numbers equals n\u00b2, we can use mathematical induction or the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. Here's a step-by-step explanation using induction:\n\n1. **Base Case (n = 1):**\n   - Sum = 1\n   - 1\u00b2 = 1\n   - Thus, the statement holds for n = 1.\n\n2. **Inductive Hypothesis:**\n   - Assume that for some natural number k, the sum of the first k odd numbers is k\u00b2:\n     - 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k - 1) = k\u00b2\n\n3. **Inductive Step:**\n   - Consider the sum of the first (k + 1) odd numbers:\n     - Sum(k + 1) = Sum(k) + (2(k + 1) - 1)\n     - Substitute the inductive hypothesis:\n       - Sum(k + 1) = k\u00b2 + (2k + 1)\n     - Simplify the expression:\n       - k\u00b2 + 2k + 1 = (k + 1)\u00b2\n   - Therefore, Sum(k + 1) = (k + 1)\u00b2.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - By mathematical induction, the sum of the first n odd numbers is n\u00b2 for all natural numbers n \u2265 1.\n\nThus, we have proven that 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2n - 1) = n\u00b2 for all natural numbers n \u2265 1.\n\nDONE."

Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that odd numbers are numbers like 1, 3, 5, 7, and so on. So the first few odd numbers are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, etc. If I take the first n of these and add them up, I should get n squared. Let me test this with small values of n to see if it holds.\n\nFor n = 1: 1 = 1\u00b2 = 1. Okay, that works.\nFor n = 2: 1 + 3 = 4, which is 2\u00b2. Good.\nFor n = 3: 1 + 3 + 5 = 9, which is 3\u00b2. Still works.\nn = 4: 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16, which is 4\u00b2. Yep.\n\nSo, empirically, it seems to hold for these small numbers. Now, how can I prove this for all natural numbers n \u2265 1?\n\nI remember that there are different methods to prove something like this\u2014maybe induction? Or is there a geometric interpretation?\n\nLet me try induction first because it's a common method for proofs involving natural numbers.\n\n**Inductive Proof:**\n\n**Base Case:** For n = 1, the sum is 1, and 1\u00b2 = 1. So the base case holds.\n\n**Inductive Step:** Assume that for some k \u2265 1, the sum of the first k odd numbers is k\u00b2. That is, 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k - 1) = k\u00b2.\n\nNow, let's consider k + 1. The sum of the first (k + 1) odd numbers would be the sum up to k plus the next odd number, which is 2(k + 1) - 1 = 2k + 1.\n\nSo, the sum becomes: 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k - 1) + (2k + 1).\n\nBy the induction hypothesis, the first part is k\u00b2, so the total sum is k\u00b2 + (2k + 1).\n\nLet's compute that: k\u00b2 + 2k + 1. Hmm, that's equal to (k + 1)\u00b2. Perfect!\n\nTherefore, by induction, the sum of the first n odd numbers is n\u00b2.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. But I also recall that there's a geometric or visual proof for this. Maybe I can think about it as a square.\n\n**Geometric Proof:**\n\nImagine drawing squares and adding them up. The first square is 1x1, which is 1. The next square is 3x3, but if you place it next to the first square, the total area covered is 1 + 3 = 4, which is 2x2. Wait, that doesn't fit. Maybe I'm not visualizing it correctly.\n\nOh, right! If you place squares of odd sizes, you can form a larger square. Let's see:\n\n- 1x1 square: area 1\n- Add 3x3 square: total area 1 + 3 = 4, which is 2x2. Hmm, but that's not a larger square. Maybe I need to arrange them differently.\n\nWait, maybe if I place them in a way that each new square adds to the side. Like, starting with 1x1, then adding 3x3 to one side, making a 2x2 square, but that doesn't account for the extra. Alternatively, maybe arranging them in a different pattern.\n\nAlternatively, think about each odd number as a layer. The first layer is 1, the second adds 3 around it, making a 3x3 square, but that would have area 1 + 3 = 4, which is 2\u00b2. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm confusing something.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. If I have the first n odd numbers, their sum is n\u00b2. So, for n=3, the sum is 9, which is 3\u00b2. If I arrange squares of odd sizes, maybe the total area is n\u00b2.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is by pairing terms. Let me try that.\n\nSuppose I have the sum: 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2n - 1).\n\nIf I write the sum forwards and backwards:\n\n1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2n - 1)\n\n(2n - 1) + (2n - 3) + ... + 3 + 1\n\nIf I add these two equations, term by term, I get:\n\n(1 + 1) + (3 + 3) + (5 + 5) + ... + ((2n - 1) + (2n - 1)) = 2(1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2n - 1)).\n\nBut the right side is n\u00b2 + n\u00b2 = 2n\u00b2.\n\nWait, no. Let me correct that. The left side is 2*(sum of the first n odd numbers). So, 2S = 2n\u00b2, which implies S = n\u00b2.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So another way to see it is that the sum can be represented as n\u00b2 by pairing terms.\n\nBut I think the induction proof is sufficient and straightforward. Maybe the geometric proof is a bit more involved or requires a different visualization.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the sum of the first n odd numbers as the sum of an arithmetic series.\n\nThe first term a1 = 1, common difference d = 2, number of terms n.\n\nThe formula for the sum of an arithmetic series is S = n/2*(2a1 + (n - 1)d).\n\nPlugging in, S = n/2*(2*1 + (n - 1)*2) = n/2*(2 + 2n - 2) = n/2*(2n) = n\u00b2.\n\nYes, that's another algebraic proof.\n\nSo, to recap, I've thought about induction, geometric interpretation (though not fully visualized), and arithmetic series formula. All lead to the conclusion that the sum of the first n odd numbers is n\u00b2.\n\nI think I'm confident with the induction proof, so I'll go with that as the solution.\n</think>\n\nTo prove that the sum of the first n odd numbers equals \\( n^2 \\), we can use mathematical induction.\n\n**Base Case:** For \\( n = 1 \\), the sum is 1, which is \\( 1^2 \\).

Let me think about this step by step. \n\nFirst off, what exactly are the first n odd numbers? Well, odd numbers are numbers like 1, 3, 5, 7, and so on. So the first n odd numbers would be 1, 3, 5, ..., up to (2n - 1). For example, if n is 3, the first three odd numbers are 1, 3, 5, and their sum is 9, which is 3 squared. Okay, that checks out. \n\nBut how do I prove this for any natural number n? Maybe I can use mathematical induction since it's a statement about all natural numbers. Induction often works well for proofs like this.\n\nSo, induction requires two steps: the base case and the inductive step. Let's start with the base case.\n\nBase case: n = 1. The first odd number is just 1. So, the sum is 1, and 1 squared is 1. That works, so the base case holds.\n\nNow, for the inductive step. I need to assume that the statement is true for some arbitrary natural number k, and then show that it must also be true for k + 1. \n\nLet me denote the sum of the first k odd numbers as S_k. According to the problem, S_k should be k squared. So, S_k = k\u00b2.\n\nNow, let's consider S_{k+1}, which is the sum of the first (k + 1) odd numbers. That would be the sum of the first k odd numbers plus the next odd number. The next odd number after the k-th odd number is 2k + 1, right? Because the first odd number is 1 (which is 2*0 + 1), the second is 3 (2*1 + 1), and so on. So, the (k + 1)-th odd number is 2k + 1.\n\nTherefore, S_{k+1} = S_k + (2k + 1). But we know S_k is k\u00b2, so substituting that in, we get S_{k+1} = k\u00b2 + 2k + 1.\n\nWait a minute, k\u00b2 + 2k + 1 is a perfect square. It's equal to (k + 1)\u00b2. So, S_{k+1} = (k + 1)\u00b2.\n\nThat's exactly what we needed to show for the inductive step. Therefore, by mathematical induction, the sum of the first n odd numbers is n squared for all natural numbers n \u2265 1.\n\nHmm, let me just double-check my reasoning. I used induction correctly: checked the base case, assumed it's true for k, and then showed it's true for k + 1. The logic seems solid. Each step follows logically from the previous one. Yeah, I think that works.\n</think>\n\nTo prove that the sum of the first \\( n \\) odd numbers equals \\( n^2 \\), we can use mathematical induction.\n\n**Base Case (\\( n = 1 \\)):**\nThe first odd number is 1. The sum is 1, which is \\( 1^2 \\). Thus, the base case holds.\n\n**Inductive Step:**\nAssume the statement is true for some arbitrary natural number \\( k \\), i.e., the sum of the first \\( k \\) odd numbers is \\( k^2 \\).\n\nConsider the sum of the first \\( k + 1 \\) odd numbers:\n\\[\nS_{k+1} = S_k + (2k + 1)\n\\]\nBy the induction hypothesis, \\( S_k = k^2 \\). Substituting this in:\n\\[\nS_{k+1} = k^2 + 2k + 1 = (k + 1)^2\n\\]\nThus, the statement holds for \\( k + 1 \\).\n\nBy the principle of mathematical induction, the sum of the first \\( n \\) odd numbers is \\( n^2 \\) for all natural numbers \\( n \\geq 1 \\).\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe sum of the first \\( n \\) odd numbers is equal to \\( n^2 \\) for all natural numbers \\( n \\geq 1 \\).

The problem states that 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2n - 1) equals n\u00b2 for all natural numbers n \u2265 1. \n\nFirst, maybe I should try plugging in some small values of n to see if the formula holds. That might give me an idea of why it works or help me spot a pattern.\n\nLet's start with n = 1. The sum should be just 1, right? And 1 squared is also 1. So, that works. \n\nNext, n = 2. The sum is 1 + 3, which equals 4. And 2 squared is 4. That matches too.\n\nNow, n = 3. The sum is 1 + 3 + 5, which is 9. And 3 squared is 9. Still works.\n\nn = 4: 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16, and 4\u00b2 is 16. Okay, so it seems to hold for these small numbers. But that's just testing, not proving it for all n.\n\nMaybe I can use mathematical induction since the statement is for all natural numbers n \u2265 1. Induction is a good method for proofs like this.\n\nSo, induction requires two steps: the base case and the inductive step.\n\nBase case: n = 1. As I did earlier, the sum is 1, which equals 1\u00b2. So, the base case holds.\n\nInductive step: Assume that the formula holds for some arbitrary natural number k. That is, assume that 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k - 1) = k\u00b2.\n\nNow, I need to show that if the formula holds for n = k, it also holds for n = k + 1. That is, show that 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k - 1) + (2(k + 1) - 1) = (k + 1)\u00b2.\n\nStarting with the left side: 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k - 1) + (2k + 1).\n\nBy the induction hypothesis, the sum up to (2k - 1) is k\u00b2. So, adding (2k + 1) gives k\u00b2 + (2k + 1).\n\nNow, let's compute k\u00b2 + (2k + 1). That's k\u00b2 + 2k + 1, which is equal to (k + 1)\u00b2.\n\nSo, the left side equals (k + 1)\u00b2, which is exactly what we needed to show. Therefore, by mathematical induction, the formula holds for all natural numbers n \u2265 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to visualize this. I remember something about pairing terms or using a diagram. Let me think.\n\nIf I write the sequence of odd numbers, maybe I can arrange them in a way that forms squares. For example:\n\n1\n\n1 + 3\n\n1 + 3 + 5\n\n1 + 3 + 5 + 7\n\n...\n\nEach time I add the next odd number, it's like adding a layer to a square. The first term is 1, which is a 1x1 square. Adding 3 gives a 2x2 square, which is 4. Adding 5 gives a 3x3 square, which is 9, and so on. So, each new odd number adds a layer, increasing the square by (2n - 1), where n is the current layer. This might be a bit abstract, but it helps to see it visually.\n\nAnother approach could be to use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. The odd numbers form an arithmetic sequence with the first term a = 1 and common difference d = 2. The nth term is given by a_n = 1 + (n - 1)*2 = 2n - 1.\n\nThe formula for the sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic series is S_n = n/2 * (a + a_n). Plugging in the values, S_n = n/2 * (1 + (2n - 1)) = n/2 * (2n) = n\u00b2.\n\nSo that's another way to see it. The sum of the first n odd numbers is n\u00b2.\n\nI think I've covered a few different methods: induction, visual pairing, and arithmetic series formula. All lead to the same conclusion that 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2n - 1) equals n squared.\n</think>\n\nTo prove that the sum of the first \\( n \\) odd numbers equals \\( n^2 \\), we can use mathematical induction.\n\n**Base Case:** For \\( n = 1 \\),\n\\[\n1 = 1^2\n\\]\nThe base case holds.\n\n**Inductive Step:** Assume the statement is true for some \\( k \\geq 1 \\), i.e.,\n\\[\n1 + 3 + 5 + \\dots + (2k - 1) = k^2\n\\]\nWe need to show it holds for \\( k + 1 \\):\n\\[\n1 + 3 + 5 + \\dots + (2k - 1) + (2(k + 1) - 1) = (k + 1)^2\n\\]\nStarting with the left side:\n\\[\nk^2 + (2k + 1) = k^2 + 2k + 1 = (k + 1)^2\n\\]\nThus, the statement holds for \\( k + 1 \\).\n\nBy induction, the sum of the first \\( n \\) odd numbers is \\( n^2 \\) for all \\( n \\geq 1 \\).\n\n**Answer:** \nDONE."
