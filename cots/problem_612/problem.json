  "answer": "To prove that 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2n-1) = n\u00b2 for all natural numbers n \u2265 1, I will use mathematical induction.\n\nStep 1: Base case (n = 1)\nWhen n = 1, the left side is just the first odd number: 1\nThe right side is 1\u00b2 = 1\nSince 1 = 1, the base case is verified.\n\nStep 2: Induction hypothesis\nAssume that the statement is true for some arbitrary k \u2265 1. That is:\n1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k-1) = k\u00b2\n\nStep 3: Inductive step\nWe need to prove the statement is true for n = k+1. That is, we need to prove:\n1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k-1) + (2(k+1)-1) = (k+1)\u00b2\n\nStarting with the left side:\n1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k-1) + (2(k+1)-1)\n= 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k-1) + (2k+1)\n\nBy our induction hypothesis, we know that 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k-1) = k\u00b2\nSo we have:\nk\u00b2 + (2k+1)\n\nNow we need to show this equals (k+1)\u00b2:\n(k+1)\u00b2 = k\u00b2 + 2k + 1\n\nComparing our expression k\u00b2 + (2k+1) with k\u00b2 + 2k + 1:\nk\u00b2 + (2k+1) = k\u00b2 + 2k + 1 = (k+1)\u00b2\n\nSince these are equal, we have proven that if the statement is true for n = k, then it is also true for n = k+1.\n\nStep 4: Conclusion\nBy the principle of mathematical induction, since we have proven:\n1) The base case (n = 1) is true\n2) If the statement is true for n = k, then it is also true for n = k+1\n\nTherefore, the statement 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2n-1) = n\u00b2 is true for all natural numbers n \u2265 1."
