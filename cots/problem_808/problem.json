  "question": "A study found that children who sleep with a night light are more likely to develop nearsightedness (myopia) later in childhood. Researchers observed that 55% of children who slept with a night light before age 2 developed myopia, compared to only 10% of children who slept in darkness. The study's authors suggested that parents should avoid using night lights to prevent vision problems in their children. However, a follow-up study revealed an important factor that the original researchers had not considered. What is the most likely explanation for the observed correlation that would challenge the causal conclusion drawn by the original researchers?",
  "answer": "The most likely explanation is that nearsighted parents are more likely to use night lights for their children, and nearsightedness has a strong genetic component.\n\nStep 1: Recognize that the original study found a correlation between night light use and myopia, but immediately jumped to a causal conclusion (that night lights cause myopia).\n\nStep 2: Consider alternative explanations for this correlation. We need to identify potential confounding variables (third factors that could influence both variables).\n\nStep 3: One strong possibility is parental vision. Nearsighted parents might be more likely to use night lights because they themselves have difficulty seeing in the dark. Since nearsightedness is significantly hereditary, these same parents are more likely to have children who develop myopia regardless of night light usage.\n\nStep 4: This explanation provides a common cause (parental myopia) for both the proposed cause (night light usage) and the effect (child myopia), creating a correlation without direct causation between the two observed variables.\n\nStep 5: This scenario illustrates why correlation doesn't imply causation - the original researchers failed to account for an important confounding variable that provides a more plausible explanation for the observed relationship."
