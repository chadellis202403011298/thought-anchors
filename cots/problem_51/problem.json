  "question": "A woman walks into a room with a match, lights a candle, a kerosene lamp, and a fireplace. When she leaves the room, she has only five objects with her. What are they?",
  "answer": "The woman is carrying her five children, whose names are Match, Candle, Kerosene Lamp, Fireplace, and Room.\n\nThis problem requires shifting perspective in how we interpret the scenario. The natural assumption is that the woman is lighting actual objects like a physical candle or lamp. However, by shifting perspective and considering alternative interpretations, we can see that 'lights' could mean 'gives birth to' or 'brings to life' in the sense of naming children.\n\nThe lateral thinking required is to break away from the conventional understanding of the scenario (lighting physical objects) and consider an unconventional interpretation (naming children). This demonstrates how the same words can have completely different meanings depending on the perspective from which we view the situation."
