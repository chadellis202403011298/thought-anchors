In other words, prove that 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2n-1) = n\u00b2 for all positive integers n. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I need to prove by mathematical induction that the sum of the first n positive odd integers is equal to n squared. Hmm, okay. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that mathematical induction involves two main steps: the base case and the inductive step. The base case is usually proving that the statement holds for n = 1, and then the inductive step assumes it holds for some arbitrary positive integer k and then proves it for k + 1.\n\nSo, starting with the base case. Let me consider n = 1. The sum of the first 1 positive odd integer is just 1. And 1 squared is also 1. So, 1 = 1, which checks out. That seems straightforward enough.\n\nNow, moving on to the inductive step. I need to assume that the statement is true for some arbitrary positive integer k. That is, I assume that the sum of the first k positive odd integers is equal to k squared. In symbols, that would be:\n\n1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k - 1) = k\u00b2.\n\nOkay, so that's my induction hypothesis. Now, I need to show that if this is true for n = k, then it must also be true for n = k + 1. That is, the sum up to the (k + 1)th odd integer should be equal to (k + 1) squared.\n\nLet me write out the sum up to the (k + 1)th odd integer. That would be:\n\n1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k - 1) + (2(k + 1) - 1).\n\nSimplifying the last term, 2(k + 1) - 1 is 2k + 2 - 1, which is 2k + 1.\n\nSo, the sum becomes:\n\n[1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k - 1)] + (2k + 1).\n\nFrom my induction hypothesis, I know that the sum up to (2k - 1) is k squared. So, substituting that in, the expression becomes:\n\nk\u00b2 + (2k + 1).\n\nNow, I need to simplify this expression to see if it equals (k + 1) squared. Let's compute (k + 1) squared:\n\n(k + 1)\u00b2 = k\u00b2 + 2k + 1.\n\nWait a minute, that's exactly the same as the expression I have from the sum:\n\nk\u00b2 + (2k + 1) = k\u00b2 + 2k + 1 = (k + 1)\u00b2.\n\nSo, that works out perfectly. Therefore, if the statement holds for n = k, it also holds for n = k + 1.\n\nSince both the base case and the inductive step have been proven, by mathematical induction, the sum of the first n positive odd integers is equal to n squared for all positive integers n.\n\nI think that covers it. I should double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the base case, everything seems to line up. Then, in the inductive step, I correctly applied the induction hypothesis and simplified the expression properly. Yeah, I'm confident in this proof.\n</think>\n\nTo prove by induction that the sum of the first \\( n \\) positive odd integers is \\( n^2 \\):\n\n**Base Case (\\( n = 1 \\)):**\nThe sum is \\( 1 \\), and \\( 1^2 = 1 \\).

Hmm, induction... I remember that involves two steps: the base case and the inductive step. Let me try to recall how that works.\n\nFirst, the base case. That's usually n=1, right? So, when n is 1, the sum of the first 1 positive odd integer is just 1. And 1 squared is also 1. So, 1 = 1, which checks out. That means the base case works. Okay, that part is straightforward.\n\nNow, the inductive step. This is where I assume that the statement is true for some arbitrary positive integer k, and then I have to show that it must also be true for k + 1. So, let me set that up.\n\nAssume that for n = k, the sum of the first k positive odd integers is k squared. So, 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k - 1) = k\u00b2. That's my induction hypothesis.\n\nNow, I need to show that when n = k + 1, the sum becomes (k + 1) squared. So, the sum would be 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k - 1) + (2(k + 1) - 1). Let me write that out: 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k - 1) + (2k + 1). \n\nFrom my induction hypothesis, I know that the sum up to (2k - 1) is k\u00b2. So, adding (2k + 1) to both sides, I get k\u00b2 + (2k + 1). That should equal (k + 1)\u00b2, right? Let me check that.\n\nExpanding (k + 1)\u00b2, that's k\u00b2 + 2k + 1. Which is exactly what I have on the other side: k\u00b2 + 2k + 1. So, that works out. Therefore, if the statement is true for n = k, it must also be true for n = k + 1.\n\nSince both the base case and the inductive step have been proven, by mathematical induction, the sum of the first n positive odd integers is equal to n\u00b2 for all positive integers n. \n\nWait, let me just double-check my inductive step. Did I make any mistakes there? I assumed the sum up to k is k\u00b2, then added the next odd number, which is 2(k + 1) - 1. That's 2k + 1. So, adding that to k\u00b2 gives k\u00b2 + 2k + 1, which is indeed (k + 1)\u00b2. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nI think I covered everything. Base case, inductive hypothesis, inductive step. It all lines up. So, yeah, the proof by induction holds.\n</think>\n\nTo prove by mathematical induction that the sum of the first \\( n \\) positive odd integers is equal to \\( n^2 \\), we proceed as follows:\n\n**Base Case (\\( n = 1 \\))**:\nThe sum of the first 1 positive odd integer is \\( 1 \\).

And 1 squared is also 1. So, 1=1, which checks out. That seems straightforward.\n\nNow, moving on to the inductive step. Let's assume that for some integer k, the sum of the first k positive odd integers is k squared. In other words, 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k-1) = k\u00b2. Okay, so that's my induction hypothesis.\n\nNow, I need to show that if this is true for k, then it must also be true for k+1. That means, I have to find the sum up to (k+1) terms and show it's equal to (k+1) squared.\n\nSo, the sum up to k+1 terms would be the sum up to k terms plus the next odd number. The next odd number after (2k-1) is 2k+1, right? Because odd numbers go 1, 3, 5, ..., 2k-1, 2k+1, etc. So, adding that to the previous sum.\n\nFrom the induction hypothesis, the sum up to k is k\u00b2. So, the sum up to k+1 is k\u00b2 + (2k+1). Let me write that down: k\u00b2 + 2k + 1. Hmm, that looks familiar. Isn't that a perfect square? Yes, because (k+1) squared is k\u00b2 + 2k + 1. So, the sum up to k+1 is (k+1)\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, by mathematical induction, the sum of the first n positive odd integers is equal to n squared for all positive integers n.\n\nWait, did I do that correctly? Let me double-check. Base case: n=1, sum is 1, which is 1\u00b2. Inductive step: Assume sum up to k is k\u00b2. Then sum up to k+1 is k\u00b2 + (2k+1) = k\u00b2 + 2k +1 = (k+1)\u00b2.

That is, I need to show that 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2n - 1) equals n\u00b2 for all positive integers n. Hmm, okay, let me recall how mathematical induction works. It's a two-step process: first, I need to prove the base case, usually for n = 1. Then, I have to assume that the statement holds for some arbitrary positive integer k, and then prove that it must also hold for k + 1. If both steps are successful, then the statement is proven for all positive integers n.\n\nAlright, starting with the base case. Let's take n = 1. Then, the sum is just 1, right? Because we're adding the first positive odd integer. So, 1. And according to the formula, n\u00b2 is 1\u00b2, which is also 1. So, the base case holds true. That's straightforward enough.\n\nNow, moving on to the induction step. Here, I need to assume that the statement is true for some arbitrary positive integer k. So, let's assume that the sum of the first k positive odd integers is equal to k\u00b2. In other words, 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k - 1) = k\u00b2. That's my induction hypothesis.\n\nNow, I need to show that if this is true, then the statement must also be true for k + 1. That is, the sum of the first (k + 1) positive odd integers should be equal to (k + 1)\u00b2. Let me write that down. The sum up to k + 1 is the sum up to k plus the next odd integer, which would be the (2(k + 1) - 1) = 2k + 1. So, the sum becomes [1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k - 1)] + (2k + 1).\n\nBut wait, from my induction hypothesis, I know that [1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k - 1)] is equal to k\u00b2. So, substituting that in, the sum becomes k\u00b2 + (2k + 1). Now, I need to show that this equals (k + 1)\u00b2. Let's compute (k + 1)\u00b2: that's k\u00b2 + 2k + 1. Hmm, interesting! So, the sum is k\u00b2 + 2k + 1, which is exactly (k + 1)\u00b2. Therefore, the statement holds for k + 1 as well.\n\nSince both the base case and the induction step have been proven, by mathematical induction, the sum of the first n positive odd integers is equal to n\u00b2 for all positive integers n. That seems to make sense. I don't see any gaps in the logic. The key idea was recognizing that adding the next odd integer in the sequence increases the sum by 2k + 1, which aligns perfectly with the expansion of (k + 1) squared.\n\nJust to double-check, maybe I should test it with a small value of n to make sure. Let's take n = 2. The sum of the first two odd integers is 1 + 3 = 4, and 2 squared is also 4. That works. How about n = 3? 1 + 3 + 5 = 9, and 3 squared is 9. Yep, that checks out too. Maybe one more, like n = 4. 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16, and 4 squared is 16. Perfect, it seems consistent.\n\nI think I've got it. The induction proof works because each time we add the next odd number, it's exactly the difference needed to go from k squared to (k + 1) squared. The pattern holds, and the induction step successfully bridges from one case to the next. No contradictions or errors in the reasoning that I can spot. So, yeah, I'm confident that this proof by induction is solid.\n</think>\n\nTo prove by mathematical induction that the sum of the first \\( n \\) positive odd integers is equal to \\( n^2 \\), we proceed as follows:\n\n**Base Case (\\( n = 1 \\)):**\nThe sum of the first 1 positive odd integer is \\( 1 \\).\nAccording to the formula, \\( n^2 = 1^2 = 1 \\).\nThus, the base case holds.\n\n**Induction Step:**\nAssume that the statement is true for some arbitrary positive integer \\( k \\), i.e.,\n\\[\n1 + 3 + 5 + \\dots + (2k - 1) = k^2\n\\]\nWe need to show that the statement holds for \\( k + 1 \\), that is:\n\\[\n1 + 3 + 5 + \\dots + (2k - 1) + (2k + 1) = (k + 1)^2\n\\]\nStarting with the left-hand side for \\( k + 1 \\):\n\\[\n[1 + 3 + 5 + \\dots + (2k - 1)] + (2k + 1)\n\\]\nBy the induction hypothesis, this becomes:\n\\[\nk^2 + (2k + 1)\n\\]\nSimplify the right-hand side:\n\\[\nk^2 + 2k + 1 = (k + 1)^2\n\\]\nThus, the statement holds for \\( k + 1 \\).\n\nBy the principle of mathematical induction, the sum of the first \\( n \\) positive odd integers is equal to \\( n^2 \\) for all positive integers \\( n \\).\n\nDONE."

That is, the sum up to the (k + 1)th odd integer should be equal to (k + 1) squared.\n\nSo, let's write that out. The sum up to (k + 1) would be the sum up to k plus the next odd integer, which is (2(k + 1) - 1) = (2k + 2 - 1) = (2k + 1). So, the sum becomes:\n\n1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k - 1) + (2k + 1)\n\nAccording to our induction hypothesis, the first part of this sum is k\u00b2. So, the entire sum is k\u00b2 + (2k + 1).

Let me compute that. The last term when n is k + 1 is 2(k + 1) - 1, which is 2k + 2 - 1, which is 2k + 1.\n\nSo, the sum up to k + 1 is the sum up to k plus (2k + 1). From my assumption, the sum up to k is k\u00b2, so the sum up to k + 1 is k\u00b2 + (2k + 1). Let me compute that: k\u00b2 + 2k + 1. Hmm, that looks like a perfect square.

Wait, what's 2(k+1)-1? Let me compute that. 2k + 2 -1 is 2k +1. So, the next odd integer after 2k-1 is 2k+1.\n\nSo, the sum up to k+1 terms would be the sum up to k terms plus (2k+1). From my assumption, the sum up to k terms is k\u00b2. So, adding (2k+1) gives k\u00b2 + 2k +1. Hmm, can I write that as something squared? Well, k\u00b2 + 2k +1 is (k+1)\u00b2. Because (k+1) squared is k\u00b2 + 2k +1. Exactly! So, that means the sum up to k+1 terms is (k+1)\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, by mathematical induction, the statement holds for all positive integers n. So, the sum of the first n positive odd integers is n squared.\n\nWait, let me just double-check. Did I make any mistakes in the inductive step? I assumed it's true for k, then showed it's true for k+1 by adding the next odd integer. Yes, that seems correct. And the base case worked.

In other words, prove that 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2n-1) = n\u00b2 for all positive integers n. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this problem where I need to prove by mathematical induction that the sum of the first n positive odd integers equals n squared. Specifically, I need to show that 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2n - 1) = n\u00b2 for all positive integers n. \n\nOkay, let's start by recalling what mathematical induction involves. From what I remember, it's a two-step process: first, I need to prove the base case, usually for n = 1. Then, I have to assume that the statement is true for some arbitrary positive integer k, and based on that, prove it must also be true for k + 1. If both steps hold, then by induction, the statement is true for all positive integers n.\n\nSo, let's tackle the base case first. When n = 1, the sum is just 1. According to the formula, n\u00b2 is 1\u00b2 = 1. So, 1 = 1, which checks out. That means the base case is proven.\n\nNext, I need to assume that the formula works for some arbitrary positive integer k. So, I'll assume that 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k - 1) = k\u00b2. This is my induction hypothesis.\n\nNow, I need to show that if this assumption is true, then the same formula should hold for k + 1. That is, I need to prove that 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k - 1) + (2(k + 1) - 1) = (k + 1)\u00b2.\n\nWait, let's break that down. The sum up to k is k\u00b2, and then we're adding the next odd integer, which is 2(k + 1) - 1. Let me compute that: 2(k + 1) - 1 = 2k + 2 - 1 = 2k + 1. So, we're adding 2k + 1 to the sum up to k.\n\nSo, the new sum becomes k\u00b2 + (2k + 1). Let me write that out: k\u00b2 + 2k + 1. Hmm, that looks familiar. It's a perfect square because (k + 1)\u00b2 = k\u00b2 + 2k + 1. So, the sum up to k + 1 is indeed (k + 1)\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, by mathematical induction, since the base case holds and the inductive step has been proven, the formula 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2n - 1) = n\u00b2 holds for all positive integers n.\n\nWait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with the base case, n = 1, sum is 1, which equals 1\u00b2. That's correct. Then, assuming it's true for n = k, so sum is k\u00b2, then adding the next odd number, which is 2k + 1, giving k\u00b2 + 2k + 1, which is (k + 1)\u00b2. Yeah, that seems right. So, I think I did it correctly.\n</think>\n\nAlright, let's go through the proof step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Base Case**\n\nWe start by verifying the statement for the first positive integer, n = 1.\n\nLeft-hand side (LHS):\n1\n\nRight-hand side (RHS):\n1\u00b2 = 1\n\nSince LHS = RHS, the base case holds true.\n\n**Step 2: Inductive Hypothesis**\n\nAssume that the statement is true for some arbitrary positive integer k. That is, assume:\n\n1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k - 1) = k\u00b2\n\n**Step 3: Inductive Step**\n\nWe need to show that if the statement holds for n = k, then it also holds for n = k + 1.\n\nConsider the sum up to k + 1:\n\n1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k - 1) + (2(k + 1) - 1)\n\nSimplify the last term:\n2(k + 1) - 1 = 2k + 2 - 1 = 2k + 1\n\nSo, the sum becomes:\n[k\u00b2] + (2k + 1) [using the inductive hypothesis]\n\nSimplify:\nk\u00b2 + 2k + 1\n\nNotice that this is a perfect square:\n(k + 1)\u00b2\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\n\nSince the statement holds for n = 1 (base case) and if it holds for n = k, it also holds for n = k + 1 (inductive step), by the principle of mathematical induction, the statement is true for all positive integers n.\n\nDONE."

Hmm, okay, let me think about how induction works. I remember that it involves two main steps: the base case and the inductive step. \n\nFirst, I should check the base case. That means when n is 1, the sum should be 1 squared, which is 1. Let me see, the first positive odd integer is just 1, so 1 equals 1 squared. Yep, that works. So the base case holds.\n\nNow, for the inductive step, I need to assume that the statement is true for some arbitrary positive integer k. That is, I assume that the sum of the first k positive odd integers is equal to k squared. So, 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k - 1) = k\u00b2. \n\nOkay, next, I need to show that if this assumption is true, then it must also be true for k + 1. That means I need to find the sum of the first (k + 1) positive odd integers and show that it equals (k + 1) squared.\n\nLet me write down the sum up to k + 1. That would be the sum up to k plus the next odd integer, which is (2(k + 1) - 1) = 2k + 1. So, the sum is 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k - 1) + (2k + 1).\n\nBut from my induction hypothesis, I know that the sum up to k is k squared. So substituting that in, the sum becomes k\u00b2 + (2k + 1). Now, I need to simplify this expression and show that it equals (k + 1) squared.\n\nLet me compute (k + 1) squared. That's k\u00b2 + 2k + 1. Hmm, interesting. So, the sum up to k + 1 is k\u00b2 + 2k + 1, which is exactly (k + 1) squared. \n\nTherefore, if the statement holds for k, it also holds for k + 1. Since the base case is true and the inductive step is valid, by mathematical induction, the sum of the first n positive odd integers is equal to n squared for all positive integers n.\n\nWait, did I do that correctly? Let me double-check. Starting with the sum up to k + 1, which is the sum up to k plus the next term. The induction hypothesis gives me k\u00b2, and then adding 2k + 1 gives me k\u00b2 + 2k + 1, which factors to (k + 1)\u00b2. Yes, that seems right. I think I've got it.\n</think>\n\nTo prove by induction that the sum of the first n positive odd integers is \\( n^2 \\):\n\n**Base Case (n = 1):**\nThe sum is \\( 1 \\), and \\( 1^2 = 1 \\).

Hmm, okay. I remember that mathematical induction involves two main steps: the base case and the inductive step. The base case is usually where you show that the statement holds for n=1, and then the inductive step is where you assume it holds for some arbitrary n=k and then show it must also hold for n=k+1.\n\nLet me start with the base case. So, when n=1, the sum of the first 1 positive odd integer is just 1. And 1 squared is also 1. So, 1=1, which is true. That takes care of the base case.\n\nNow, onto the inductive step. I need to assume that the statement is true for some arbitrary positive integer k. That means I'll assume that the sum of the first k positive odd integers is equal to k squared. So, 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k-1) = k\u00b2.\n\nNext, I have to show that if this assumption is true, then the statement must also hold for k+1.

The sum up to k+1 would be the sum up to k plus the next odd integer, which is (2(k+1)-1) = 2k+1. So, the sum becomes 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k-1) + (2k+1).\n\nBut from my induction hypothesis, I know that 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2k-1) equals k\u00b2. So, substituting that in, the sum becomes k\u00b2 + (2k+1). Now, I need to show that this is equal to (k+1) squared.\n\nLet me compute (k+1) squared. That's k\u00b2 + 2k + 1. So, k\u00b2 + (2k + 1) equals k\u00b2 + 2k + 1, which is exactly (k+1) squared. Therefore, the sum up to k+1 is indeed (k+1) squared.\n\nWait, does that make sense? Let me double-check. If I have k=2, then the sum should be 1 + 3 = 4, which is 2 squared. Then, for k+1=3, the sum should be 1 + 3 + 5 = 9, which is 3 squared. Yeah, that checks out.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I've shown that the base case holds and that if the statement is true for n=k, it's also true for n=k+1. Therefore, by mathematical induction, the sum of the first n positive odd integers is equal to n squared for all positive integers n.\n\nI think that's it. I didn't make any mistakes in the calculations, right? Let me just recap: base case works, inductive step assumes true for k, shows true for k+1.
