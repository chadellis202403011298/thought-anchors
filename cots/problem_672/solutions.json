It appears that each difference increases by 2, indicating a pattern of even numbers.\n\nNext, I'll observe the sequence of differences: 4, 6, 8, 10, 12. This is an arithmetic sequence where each term increases by 2.\n\nSince the differences themselves form an arithmetic sequence, the original sequence follows a quadratic pattern. Therefore, the nth term can be expressed as a quadratic function of n.\n\nI'll assume the nth term is given by the formula:\n\nTerm(n) = an\u00b2 + bn + c\n\nTo find the coefficients a, b, and c, I'll set up equations using the known terms:\n\nFor n=1: a(1)\u00b2 + b(1) + c = 2 \u21d2 a + b + c = 2  \nFor n=2: a(2)\u00b2 + b(2) + c = 6 \u21d2 4a + 2b + c = 6  \nFor n=3: a(3)\u00b2 + b(3) + c = 12 \u21d2 9a + 3b + c = 12\n\nNow, I'll solve this system of equations.\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second:\n(4a + 2b + c) - (a + b + c) = 6 - 2  \n3a + b = 4  ...(1)\n\nSubtracting the second equation from the third:\n(9a + 3b + c) - (4a + 2b + c) = 12 - 6  \n5a + b = 6  ...(2)\n\nSubtracting equation (1) from equation (2):\n(5a + b) - (3a + b) = 6 - 4  \n2a = 2 \u21d2 a = 1\n\nSubstituting a = 1 into equation (1):\n3(1) + b = 4 \u21d2 b = 1\n\nFinally, substituting a = 1 and b = 1 into the first equation:\n1 + 1 + c = 2 \u21d2 c = 0\n\nSo, the nth term is:\n\nTerm(n) = n\u00b2 + n\n\nTherefore, the next term when n=6 is:\n\nTerm(6) = 6\u00b2 + 6 = 36 + 6 = 42\n\nWait, that's the same as the last given term. That doesn't make sense. Let me check my calculations.\n\nLooking back, I realize that the last term given is 42, which corresponds to n=6. But according to the formula, Term(6) = 6\u00b2 + 6 = 42, which matches. So, the next term should be for n=7.\n\nCalculating Term(7):\n\nTerm(7) = 7\u00b2 + 7 = 49 + 7 = 56\n\nSo, the next number in the sequence is 56.\n</think>\n\nThe sequence increases by an even number each time, following a quadratic pattern.
