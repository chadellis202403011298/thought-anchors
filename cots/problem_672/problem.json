  "question": "Consider the following sequence of numbers:\n\n2, 6, 12, 20, 30, 42, ?\n\nWhat is the next number in this sequence?",
  "answer": "The next number in the sequence is 56.\n\nTo find this answer, I need to identify the pattern in how the sequence grows.\n\nLet's examine the differences between consecutive terms:\n- Between 2 and 6: 6 - 2 = 4\n- Between 6 and 12: 12 - 6 = 6\n- Between 12 and 20: 20 - 12 = 8\n- Between 20 and 30: 30 - 20 = 10\n- Between 30 and 42: 42 - 30 = 12\n\nThe differences form a simple arithmetic sequence: 4, 6, 8, 10, 12\n\nI notice that these differences increase by 2 each time.\n\nSo the next difference should be 12 + 2 = 14.\n\nTherefore, the next number in the original sequence should be 42 + 14 = 56.\n\nThis sequence can be described by the formula: a(n) = n\u00b2 + n, where n starts from 1."
