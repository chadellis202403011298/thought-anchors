  "question": "A cafe offers a lunch special where customers select one main dish and one side dish. There are 3 main dishes available (pasta, sandwich, salad) and 4 side dishes (fries, soup, fruit, yogurt). The cafe owner notices that 60% of customers who order pasta choose soup as their side dish, while only 25% of customers who order a sandwich or salad choose soup. A customer places an order for lunch. If the probability that a customer selects soup as their side dish is 35%, what is the probability that the customer ordered pasta as their main dish?",
  "answer": "This problem requires us to determine whether the selection of main dish and side dish are independent or dependent events, and then use conditional probability to find our answer.\n\n1) Let's define our events:\n   - P = \"customer orders pasta\"\n   - S = \"customer orders soup\"\n\n2) We're given the following information:\n   - P(S|P) = 0.60 (probability of ordering soup given that pasta was ordered)\n   - P(S|not P) = 0.25 (probability of ordering soup given that pasta was not ordered)\n   - P(S) = 0.35 (overall probability of ordering soup)\n\n3) We need to find P(P|S), which is the probability that a customer ordered pasta given that they ordered soup.\n\n4) Using Bayes' theorem: P(P|S) = [P(S|P) \u00d7 P(P)] / P(S)\n\n5) We need to find P(P), the probability that a customer orders pasta.\n   The overall probability of ordering soup can be written as:\n   P(S) = P(S|P) \u00d7 P(P) + P(S|not P) \u00d7 P(not P)\n   0.35 = 0.60 \u00d7 P(P) + 0.25 \u00d7 (1 - P(P))\n   0.35 = 0.60 \u00d7 P(P) + 0.25 - 0.25 \u00d7 P(P)\n   0.35 = 0.25 + 0.35 \u00d7 P(P)\n   0.10 = 0.35 \u00d7 P(P)\n   P(P) = 0.10 / 0.35 = 2/7 \u2248 0.286\n\n6) Now we can apply Bayes' theorem to find P(P|S):\n   P(P|S) = [P(S|P) \u00d7 P(P)] / P(S)\n   P(P|S) = [0.60 \u00d7 (2/7)] / 0.35\n   P(P|S) = [0.60 \u00d7 (2/7)] / 0.35\n   P(P|S) = 0.12 / 0.35\n   P(P|S) = 12/35 = 4/35 \u00d7 3 = 12/35\n   P(P|S) = 0.343 or approximately 34.3%\n\nTherefore, if a customer orders soup as their side dish, there is a 34.3% probability that they ordered pasta as their main dish."
