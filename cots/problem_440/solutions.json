In a fixed-effects meta-analysis, each study is weighted by the inverse of its variance (where variance = standard error\u00b2), and the overall effect estimate is calculated as the sum of weighted effects divided by the sum of weights.\n\nWhat is the overall mean reduction in blood pressure across these three studies? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out the overall mean reduction in blood pressure from these three studies using a fixed-effects meta-analysis. Hmm, okay, fixed-effects meta-analysis... I remember that in fixed effects, each study is weighted by the inverse of its variance, which is the standard error squared. That makes sense because larger studies (with more participants) tend to have smaller standard errors, so they should have a bigger weight, right? \n\nLet me break down the data first. There are three researchers: A, B, and C. Each has their own number of participants, mean reduction in blood pressure, and standard error. \n\nResearcher A: 120 participants, mean reduction of 8 mmHg, standard error of 2 mmHg.\nResearcher B: 80 participants, mean reduction of 12 mmHg, standard error of 3 mmHg.\nResearcher C: 200 participants, mean reduction of 6 mmHg, standard error of 1.5 mmHg.\n\nOkay, so for each researcher, I need to calculate the weight, which is 1 divided by the variance (standard error squared). Then, I'll sum up all the weights and divide the total weighted mean reduction by the total weight to get the overall effect estimate.\n\nLet me start with Researcher A. Their standard error is 2 mmHg, so variance is 2 squared, which is 4. Therefore, the weight is 1/4, which is 0.25.\n\nNext, Researcher B has a standard error of 3 mmHg. So variance is 9, and the weight is 1/9, approximately 0.1111.\n\nResearcher C has a standard error of 1.5 mmHg. Squaring that gives 2.25. So the weight is 1/2.25, which is approximately 0.4444.\n\nNow, I need to sum up these weights. Let me calculate that:\n\n0.25 (A) + 0.1111 (B) + 0.4444 (C) = \n\n0.25 + 0.1111 is 0.3611, and adding 0.4444 gives 0.8055. So the total weight is approximately 0.8055.\n\nNow, I need to calculate the total weighted mean reduction. That means I multiply each mean reduction by its respective weight and then sum them up.\n\nFor Researcher A: 8 mmHg * 0.25 = 2 mmHg.\nFor Researcher B: 12 mmHg * 0.1111 \u2248 1.3333 mmHg.\nFor Researcher C: 6 mmHg * 0.4444 \u2248 2.6666 mmHg.\n\nAdding these up: 2 + 1.3333 + 2.6666 = 6 mmHg.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So the overall mean reduction is 6 mmHg.\n\nBut let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nCalculating the weights again:\n\nResearcher A: 1/(2^2) = 0.25\nResearcher B: 1/(3^2) \u2248 0.1111\nResearcher C: 1/(1.5^2) = 1/2.25 \u2248 0.4444\n\nTotal weight: 0.25 + 0.1111 + 0.4444 = 0.8055\n\nTotal weighted mean:\n\n8 * 0.25 = 2\n12 * 0.1111 \u2248 1.3333\n6 * 0.4444 \u2248 2.6666\n\nAdding them: 2 + 1.3333 + 2.6666 = 6 mmHg.\n\nYeah, that seems correct. So the overall mean reduction is 6 mmHg.\n</think>\n\nThe overall mean reduction in blood pressure across the three studies is calculated by weighting each study's effect by the inverse of its variance (standard error squared) and then summing these weighted effects and dividing by the total weight. \n\n- **Weight for Researcher A**: 1 / (2\u00b2) = 0.25\n- **Weight for Researcher B**: 1 / (3\u00b2) \u2248 0.1111\n- **Weight for Researcher C**: 1 / (1.5\u00b2) \u2248 0.4444\n\nTotal weight = 0.25 + 0.1111 + 0.4444 \u2248 0.8055\n\nTotal weighted mean reduction = (8 * 0.25) + (12 * 0.1111) + (6 * 0.4444) \u2248 2 + 1.3333 + 2.6666 = 6 mmHg\n\n**Answer:** The overall mean reduction in blood pressure is 6 mmHg.\n\nDONE."

Hmm, okay, I've heard about meta-analyses before, but I'm not exactly sure how they work. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem mentions three researchers\u2014A, B, and C\u2014who conducted separate studies. Each has a different number of participants, mean reductions in blood pressure, and standard errors. I think these are the key pieces of information I need to calculate the overall effect.\n\nSo, the formula for a fixed-effects meta-analysis is given as the sum of weighted effects divided by the sum of weights. The weight for each study is the inverse of its variance. Since variance is the standard error squared, I'll need to calculate that first for each researcher.\n\nLet me jot down the data:\n\n- **Researcher A**: 120 participants, mean reduction 8 mmHg, standard error 2 mmHg\n- **Researcher B**: 80 participants, mean reduction 12 mmHg, standard error 3 mmHg\n- **Researcher C**: 200 participants, mean reduction 6 mmHg, standard error 1.5 mmHg\n\nOkay, so for each researcher, I need to compute the weight, which is 1 divided by the variance (standard error squared). Let me do that.\n\nStarting with Researcher A:\n- Variance A = (2 mmHg)^2 = 4 mmHg\u00b2\n- Weight A = 1 / 4 = 0.25\n\nResearcher B:\n- Variance B = (3 mmHg)^2 = 9 mmHg\u00b2\n- Weight B = 1 / 9 \u2248 0.1111\n\nResearcher C:\n- Variance C = (1.5 mmHg)^2 = 2.25 mmHg\u00b2\n- Weight C = 1 / 2.25 \u2248 0.4444\n\nAlright, now I have the weights. Next, I need to calculate the weighted mean reduction. That means multiplying each mean reduction by its respective weight and then summing them up.\n\nSo, let's compute each term:\n\nFor Researcher A:\n- Weighted effect A = 8 mmHg * 0.25 = 2 mmHg\n\nFor Researcher B:\n- Weighted effect B = 12 mmHg * 0.1111 \u2248 1.3333 mmHg\n\nFor Researcher C:\n- Weighted effect C = 6 mmHg * 0.4444 \u2248 2.6666 mmHg\n\nNow, sum these weighted effects:\n2 + 1.3333 + 2.6666 \u2248 6 mmHg\n\nWait, that seems low. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, no, that's correct. But let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the multiplication.\n\nYes, 8 * 0.25 is 2, 12 * 0.1111 is approximately 1.3333, and 6 * 0.4444 is approximately 2.6666. Adding them up gives 6 mmHg.\n\nBut I also need to calculate the sum of the weights to ensure I'm not missing anything. Let me add the weights:\n\n0.25 + 0.1111 + 0.4444 \u2248 0.8055\n\nSo, the overall effect estimate is the sum of weighted effects divided by the sum of weights. That would be:\n\n6 mmHg / 0.8055 \u2248 7.44 mmHg\n\nWait, that's different from my initial calculation. Did I do something wrong?\n\nOh, I see! I think I messed up the initial calculation. I should have summed the weighted effects first and then divided by the sum of weights, not the other way around. Let me correct that.\n\nSo, the sum of weighted effects is indeed 6 mmHg, and the sum of weights is approximately 0.8055. Therefore, the overall effect estimate is 6 / 0.8055 \u2248 7.44 mmHg.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right because the individual means are 8, 12, and 6. The overall effect should be somewhere in between, but 7.44 is actually closer to 6 than to 12. Maybe because the weights are not equal, and Researcher C has a much larger sample size, which gives it more weight.\n\nLet me verify the weights again:\n\n- Researcher A: 120 participants, so inverse variance is 1/(2^2)=0.25\n- Researcher B: 80 participants, inverse variance 1/(3^2)=0.1111\n- Researcher C: 200 participants, inverse variance 1/(1.5^2)=0.4444\n\nYes, those weights look correct.\n\nCalculating the sum of weights: 0.25 + 0.1111 + 0.4444 = 0.8055\n\nCalculating the numerator: (8*0.25) + (12*0.1111) + (6*0.4444) = 2 + 1.3333 + 2.6666 = 6\n\nSo, 6 / 0.8055 \u2248 7.44 mmHg\n\nBut let me check if I did the weighted mean correctly. Alternatively, maybe I should use the formula where it's the sum of (effect * weight) divided by the sum of weights.\n\nYes, that's what I did. So, 7.44 mmHg is the overall mean reduction.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I have a larger sample size, shouldn't it have a bigger impact? Researcher C has 200 participants, which is the largest, and their effect is 6 mmHg. So, their weight is 0.4444, which is the highest. So, the overall effect should be closer to 6 than to 12, which it is.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should present it to more decimal places for accuracy.\n\nCalculating 6 / 0.8055:\n\n0.8055 goes into 6 approximately 7.44 times, but let me do the division more precisely.\n\n0.8055 * 7 = 5.6385\n\nSubtract that from 6: 6 - 5.6385 = 0.3615\n\n0.8055 * 0.45 = 0.3625\n\nSo, 7.45 would be 0.8055 * 7.45 \u2248 6.0035, which is very close to 6.\n\nTherefore, the overall effect is approximately 7.45 mmHg.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 6 / 0.8055 \u2248 7.44, which is about 7.44 mmHg.\n\nI think that's correct. So, the overall mean reduction is approximately 7.44 mmHg.\n\nBut let me double-check everything once more to be sure.\n\nParticipants: 120, 80, 200\n\nMean reductions: 8, 12, 6\n\nStandard errors: 2, 3, 1.5\n\nWeights:\n\nA: 1/(2^2)=0.25\n\nB: 1/(3^2)=0.1111\n\nC: 1/(1.5^2)=0.4444\n\nSum of weights: 0.25 + 0.1111 + 0.4444 = 0.8055\n\nWeighted effects:\n\n8*0.25=2\n\n12*0.1111\u22481.3333\n\n6*0.4444\u22482.6666\n\nTotal weighted effects: 2 + 1.3333 + 2.6666 = 6\n\nOverall effect: 6 / 0.8055 \u2248 7.44 mmHg\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, the overall mean reduction is approximately 7.44 mmHg.\n</think>\n\nThe overall mean reduction in blood pressure across the three studies is calculated by weighting each study's effect by the inverse of its variance and then dividing the sum of these weighted effects by the sum of the weights. \n\n- **Researcher A**: Weight = 0.25, Weighted effect = 2 mmHg\n- **Researcher B**: Weight = 0.1111, Weighted effect \u2248 1.3333 mmHg\n- **Researcher C**: Weight = 0.4444, Weighted effect \u2248 2.6666 mmHg\n\nSum of weighted effects = 2 + 1.3333 + 2.6666 \u2248 6 mmHg\n\nSum of weights = 0.25 + 0.1111 + 0.4444 \u2248 0.8055\n\nOverall effect estimate = 6 / 0.8055 \u2248 7.44 mmHg\n\nDONE."

I remember that in fixed-effects, each study is weighted by the inverse of its variance, and the variance is the standard error squared. So, first, I should probably calculate the variance for each researcher.\n\nLet me start with Researcher A. They have a standard error of 2 mmHg, so the variance would be 2 squared, which is 4. Then, the weight for each study is the inverse of the variance. So for A, the weight would be 1 divided by 4, which is 0.25.\n\nNext, Researcher B has a standard error of 3 mmHg. Squaring that gives a variance of 9. So the weight here is 1 divided by 9, which is approximately 0.1111.\n\nFor Researcher C, the standard error is 1.5 mmHg. Squaring that gives 2.25.

In a fixed-effects meta-analysis, each study is weighted by the inverse of its variance (where variance = standard error\u00b2), and the overall effect estimate is calculated as the sum of weighted effects divided by the sum of weights.\n\nWhat is the overall mean reduction in blood pressure across these three studies? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem where three researchers did studies on a new medication's effect on blood pressure in hypertensive patients. I need to perform a fixed-effects meta-analysis to find the overall mean reduction. Hmm, fixed-effects vs. random-effects... Right, fixed-effects assumes that the effect size is the same across all studies, which seems to be the case here since we're just adding them up.\n\nAlright, the formula for the overall effect in a fixed-effects meta-analysis is the sum of the weighted effects divided by the sum of the weights. Each study is weighted by the inverse of its variance, and variance is the standard error squared.\n\nSo, let's break down the data:\n\n- Researcher A: 120 participants, mean reduction 8 mmHg, standard error 2 mmHg.\n- Researcher B: 80 participants, mean reduction 12 mmHg, standard error 3 mmHg.\n- Researcher C: 200 participants, mean reduction 6 mmHg, standard error 1.5 mmHg.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the weight for each researcher. The weight is 1 divided by the variance, which is the standard error squared.\n\nFor Researcher A:\nWeight = 1 / (2)^2 = 1 / 4 = 0.25\n\nFor Researcher B:\nWeight = 1 / (3)^2 = 1 / 9 \u2248 0.1111\n\nFor Researcher C:\nWeight = 1 / (1.5)^2 = 1 / 2.25 \u2248 0.4444\n\nWait, let me double-check that. 1.5 squared is 2.25, so yes, 1 divided by 2.25 is approximately 0.4444.\n\nNow, I need to calculate the numerator, which is the sum of (weight * effect) for each researcher.\n\nFor Researcher A: 0.25 * 8 = 2\n\nFor Researcher B: 0.1111 * 12 \u2248 1.3333\n\nFor Researcher C: 0.4444 * 6 \u2248 2.6666\n\nAdding those up: 2 + 1.3333 + 2.6666 = 6\n\nNow, the denominator is the sum of the weights: 0.25 + 0.1111 + 0.4444 = 0.8055\n\nSo, the overall effect is 6 / 0.8055 \u2248 7.44 mmHg\n\nWait, that seems a bit low. Let me check the calculations again.\n\nResearcher A: 8 * 0.25 = 2\n\nResearcher B: 12 * (1/9) \u2248 1.3333\n\nResearcher C: 6 * (4/9) \u2248 2.6667\n\nAdding those: 2 + 1.3333 + 2.6667 = 6\n\nSum of weights: 0.25 + 0.1111 + 0.4444 = 0.8055\n\n6 / 0.8055 \u2248 7.44 mmHg\n\nHmm, maybe that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I should express the weights as fractions for more precision.\n\nResearcher A: 1/4\n\nResearcher B: 1/9\n\nResearcher C: 4/9\n\nSo, numerator:\n\n8*(1/4) + 12*(1/9) + 6*(4/9)\n\n= 2 + 12/9 + 24/9\n\n= 2 + 4 + 8/3\n\nWait, 12/9 is 4/3, and 24/9 is 8/3.\n\nSo, 2 + 4 + 8/3 = 6 + 8/3 = 6 + 2.6667 = 8.6667\n\nDenominator:\n\n1/4 + 1/9 + 4/9\n\n= (9/36) + (4/36) + (16/36)\n\n= (9 + 4 + 16)/36 = 29/36\n\nSo, overall effect = 8.6667 / (29/36) = 8.6667 * (36/29)\n\nCalculating that: 8.6667 * 36 = 311.4667\n\n311.4667 / 29 \u2248 10.75 mmHg\n\nWait, now I'm getting a different answer. Did I mess up the fractions?\n\nWait, numerator was 8*(1/4) + 12*(1/9) + 6*(4/9) = 2 + 4/3 + 24/9\n\nWait, 24/9 is 8/3, so 2 + 4/3 + 8/3 = 2 + 12/3 = 2 + 4 = 6\n\nWait, that contradicts what I did earlier. Hmm, maybe I should do it step by step.\n\nLet me write it all out:\n\nNumerator:\n\n8*(1/4) = 2\n\n12*(1/9) = 4/3 \u2248 1.3333\n\n6*(4/9) = 24/9 = 8/3 \u2248 2.6667\n\nTotal numerator: 2 + 4/3 + 8/3 = 2 + (4+8)/3 = 2 + 12/3 = 2 + 4 = 6\n\nDenominator:\n\n1/4 + 1/9 + 4/9 = 1/4 + 5/9\n\nConvert to common denominator of 36:\n\n1/4 = 9/36\n\n5/9 = 20/36\n\nTotal denominator: 29/36\n\nSo, overall effect = 6 / (29/36) = 6 * (36/29) = 216/29 \u2248 7.4483 \u2248 7.45 mmHg\n\nWait, so earlier I thought it was 7.44, and now with fractions, it's approximately 7.45. So, about 7.45 mmHg.\n\nBut earlier, when I did it with decimals, I got 6 / 0.8055 \u2248 7.44, which is consistent.\n\nSo, the overall mean reduction is approximately 7.45 mmHg.\n\nBut to be precise, let's compute 216 divided by 29.\n\n29*7 = 203\n\n216 - 203 = 13\n\nSo, 7 + 13/29 \u2248 7.4483, which is about 7.45 mmHg.\n\nSo, the answer should be approximately 7.45 mmHg.\n\nAlternatively, to more decimal places, 7.4483, but probably round to two decimal places, so 7.45 mmHg.\n\nWait, but let me check again because earlier I thought I had 8.6667, which was wrong. So, the correct numerator is 6, denominator 29/36, so 6/(29/36)=216/29\u22487.4483.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n</think>\n\nThe overall mean reduction in blood pressure across the three studies is approximately 7.45 mmHg.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Identify the formula for fixed-effects meta-analysis:**\n   - Overall effect = (Sum of (weight * effect)) / (Sum of weights)\n   - Weight = 1 / (standard error)^2\n\n2. **Calculate weights for each researcher:**\n   - Researcher A: 1 / (2)^2 = 0.25\n   - Researcher B: 1 / (3)^2 \u2248 0.1111\n   - Researcher C: 1 / (1.5)^2 \u2248 0.4444\n\n3. **Compute the weighted sum of effects:**\n   - Researcher A: 0.25 * 8 = 2\n   - Researcher B: 0.1111 * 12 \u2248 1.3333\n   - Researcher C: 0.4444 * 6 \u2248 2.6666\n   - Total = 2 + 1.3333 + 2.6666 \u2248 6\n\n4. **Sum the weights:**\n   - Total weight = 0.25 + 0.1111 + 0.4444 \u2248 0.8055\n\n5. **Calculate the overall effect:**\n   - 6 / 0.8055 \u2248 7.44 mmHg\n\n6. **Express as a fraction for precision:**\n   - Numerator = 6\n   - Denominator = 29/36\n   - Overall effect = 6 * (36/29) \u2248 7.4483 \u2248 7.45 mmHg\n\n**Answer:** The overall mean reduction in blood pressure is approximately 7.45 mmHg.\n\nDONE."

Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that in a fixed-effects meta-analysis, each study is given a weight based on the inverse of its variance. The variance is the square of the standard error. So, I'll need to calculate the weight for each researcher.\n\nLet's start with Researcher A:\n- Participants: 120\n- Mean reduction: 8 mmHg\n- Standard error: 2 mmHg\nSo, the variance for Researcher A is \\(2^2 = 4\\) mmHg\u00b2.\nTherefore, the weight for Researcher A is \\(1/4 = 0.25\\).\n\nNext, Researcher B:\n- Participants: 80\n- Mean reduction: 12 mmHg\n- Standard error: 3 mmHg\nVariance is \\(3^2 = 9\\) mmHg\u00b2.\nWeight for Researcher B is \\(1/9 \\approx 0.1111\\).\n\nLastly, Researcher C:\n- Participants: 200\n- Mean reduction: 6 mmHg\n- Standard error: 1.5 mmHg\nVariance is \\(1.5^2 = 2.25\\) mmHg\u00b2.\nWeight for Researcher C is \\(1/2.25 \\approx 0.4444\\).\n\nNow, I need to calculate the overall mean reduction. The formula is:\n\\[\n\\text{Overall effect} = \\frac{\\sum (\\text{Weight}_i \\times \\text{Effect}_i)}{\\sum \\text{Weight}_i}\n\\]\n\nLet me compute each part:\n- Weight A * Effect A = 0.25 * 8 = 2\n- Weight B * Effect B = 0.1111 * 12 \u2248 1.3333\n- Weight C * Effect C = 0.4444 * 6 \u2248 2.6666\n\nAdding those up: 2 + 1.3333 + 2.6666 \u2248 6.0 mmHg\n\nNow, sum of weights: 0.25 + 0.1111 + 0.4444 \u2248 0.8055\n\nSo, overall effect is 6.0 / 0.8055 \u2248 7.44 mmHg\n\nWait, that seems a bit high.

Let me break down what I know and how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that a fixed-effects meta-analysis involves combining results from multiple studies, each of which has its own sample size, mean effect, and standard error. The goal is to calculate an overall effect estimate that represents the combined result.\n\nThe formula provided is that each study is weighted by the inverse of its variance, where variance is the standard error squared. So, the weight for each study is 1 divided by the variance, which is (standard error)\u00b2. Then, the overall effect estimate is the sum of the weighted effects (mean reductions) divided by the sum of the weights.\n\nLet me list out the data for each researcher:\n\n- **Researcher A**: 120 participants, mean reduction of 8 mmHg, standard error of 2 mmHg.\n- **Researcher B**: 80 participants, mean reduction of 12 mmHg, standard error of 3 mmHg.\n- **Researcher C**: 200 participants, mean reduction of 6 mmHg, standard error of 1.5 mmHg.\n\nSo, for each researcher, I need to compute the weight, which is 1 divided by the variance (standard error squared). Then, I'll multiply each mean reduction by its corresponding weight and sum them up. After that, I'll divide the total by the sum of all weights to get the overall mean reduction.\n\nLet me compute each step one by one.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the variance for each researcher.**\n\nVariance = (Standard Error)\u00b2\n\n- Researcher A: 2\u00b2 = 4\n- Researcher B: 3\u00b2 = 9\n- Researcher C: 1.5\u00b2 = 2.25\n\n**Step 2: Compute the weight for each researcher.**\n\nWeight = 1 / Variance\n\n- Researcher A: 1 / 4 = 0.25\n- Researcher B: 1 / 9 \u2248 0.1111\n- Researcher C: 1 / 2.25 \u2248 0.4444\n\n**Step 3: Multiply each mean reduction by its weight.**\n\n- Researcher A: 8 mmHg * 0.25 = 2\n- Researcher B: 12 mmHg * 0.1111 \u2248 1.3333\n- Researcher C: 6 mmHg * 0.4444 \u2248 2.6666\n\n**Step 4: Sum these products to get the numerator of the overall effect estimate.**\n\nTotal numerator = 2 + 1.3333 + 2.6666 \u2248 6\n\n**Step 5: Sum the weights to get the denominator.**\n\nTotal denominator = 0.25 + 0.1111 + 0.4444 \u2248 0.8056\n\n**Step 6: Divide the numerator by the denominator to get the overall mean reduction.**\n\nOverall effect = Total numerator / Total denominator \u2248 6 / 0.8056 \u2248 7.46 mmHg\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\n- Variance for A: 4, weight 0.25\n- Variance for B: 9, weight \u22480.1111\n- Variance for C: 2.25, weight \u22480.4444\n\nMean reductions:\n\n- A: 8 * 0.25 = 2\n- B: 12 * 0.1111 \u22481.3333\n- C: 6 * 0.4444 \u22482.6666\n\nSumming these: 2 + 1.3333 + 2.6666 = 6\n\nSum of weights: 0.25 + 0.1111 + 0.4444 = 0.8056\n\n6 divided by 0.8056 is approximately 7.46 mmHg.\n\nHmm, that seems reasonable. But let me cross-verify using exact fractions instead of decimal approximations to be precise.\n\n**Researcher A:**\n\nWeight = 1/4\n\nContribution = 8 * (1/4) = 2\n\n**Researcher B:**\n\nWeight = 1/9\n\nContribution = 12 * (1/9) = 12/9 = 4/3 \u22481.3333\n\n**Researcher C:**\n\nWeight = 1/(1.5\u00b2) = 1/2.25 = 4/9 \u22480.4444\n\nContribution = 6 * (4/9) = 24/9 = 8/3 \u22482.6667\n\nTotal numerator: 2 + 4/3 + 8/3 = 2 + (4+8)/3 = 2 + 12/3 = 2 + 4 = 6\n\nTotal denominator: 1/4 + 1/9 + 4/9\n\nConvert to common denominator, which is 36:\n\n1/4 = 9/36\n\n1/9 = 4/36\n\n4/9 = 16/36\n\nSum: 9 + 4 + 16 = 29/36 \u22480.8056\n\nSo, overall effect = 6 / (29/36) = 6 * (36/29) = 216/29 \u22487.4483 mmHg\n\nRounded to two decimal places, that's approximately 7.45 mmHg.\n\nWait, earlier I got approximately 7.46 mmHg, and now it's 7.4483, which is about 7.45 mmHg.

Hmm, fixed-effects means each study is weighted by the inverse of its variance, right?

And 1 divided by 2.25 is about 0.4444, that's right.\n\nNext, I need to compute the weighted effect for each study. That is, the mean reduction multiplied by the weight.\n\n- Researcher A: 8 * 0.25 = 2\n- Researcher B: 12 * 0.1111 \u2248 1.3333\n- Researcher C: 6 * 0.4444 \u2248 2.6666\n\nNow, I should sum up all the weighted effects and all the weights.\n\nSum of weighted effects: 2 + 1.3333 + 2.6666 = 6\n\nSum of weights: 0.25 + 0.1111 + 0.4444 = 0.8055\n\nWait, let me add those again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n0.25 + 0.1111 is 0.3611, plus 0.4444 gives 0.8055. Okay, that's correct.\n\nSo, the overall effect is the sum of weighted effects divided by the sum of weights. So that's 6 divided by 0.8055.\n\nLet me calculate that: 6 / 0.8055 \u2248 7.46 mmHg\n\nWait, let me do that division more accurately. 0.8055 times 7 is 5.6385. 0.8055 times 7.46 is roughly 6. So, yes, approximately 7.46 mmHg.\n\nHmm, but let me check my calculations again step by step to ensure I didn't make any errors.\n\nFirst, variances:\n\n- A: 2^2 = 4\n- B: 3^2 = 9\n- C: 1.5^2 = 2.25\n\nWeights:\n\n- A: 1/4 = 0.25\n- B: 1/9 \u2248 0.1111\n- C: 1/2.25 \u2248 0.4444\n\nWeighted effects:\n\n- A: 8 * 0.25 = 2\n- B: 12 * 0.1111 \u2248 1.3333\n- C: 6 * 0.4444 \u2248 2.6666\n\nSum of weighted effects: 2 + 1.3333 + 2.6666 = 6. That's correct.\n\nSum of weights: 0.25 + 0.1111 + 0.4444 = 0.8055\n\nSo, 6 divided by 0.8055 \u2248 7.46 mmHg\n\nWait, but let me think about whether I should round this or present it more accurately.\n\nIf I compute 6 / 0.8055, let's do it more precisely.\n\n0.8055 x 7 = 5.6385\n\nSubtract that from 6: 6 - 5.6385 = 0.3615\n\nNow, 0.3615 / 0.8055 \u2248 0.448\n\nSo, total is 7 + 0.448 \u2248 7.448 mmHg\n\nRounded to two decimal places, that's 7.45 mmHg\n\nWait, but let me check the exact division.\n\n6 / 0.8055 = ?\n\nLet me write this as 6000 / 805.5 to eliminate decimals.\n\nDivide 6000 by 805.5.\n\nFirst, 805.5 x 7 = 5643.5\n\nSubtract from 6000: 6000 - 5643.5 = 356.5\n\nNow, 805.5 x 0.44 = 356.5 (since 805.5 x 0.4 = 322.2; 805.5 x 0.04 = 32.22; total 322.2 + 32.22 = 354.42). Hmm, close but not exact. Maybe 0.445.\n\nWait, 805.5 x 0.445 = 805.5 x 0.4 + 805.5 x 0.04 + 805.5 x 0.005\n\n= 322.2 + 32.22 + 4.0275 = 322.2 + 32.22 = 354.42 + 4.0275 = 358.4475\n\nThat's more than 356.5, so maybe 0.443.\n\nWait, this is getting too detailed. Maybe it's better to use a calculator approximation.\n\nBut for the purpose of this problem, I think 7.46 mmHg is sufficient. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to keep it to two decimal places, so 7.45 mmHg.\n\nWait, but let me check using a calculator: 6 / 0.8055 \u2248 7.448, which rounds to 7.45 mmHg.\n\nAlternatively, if I use more precise calculations, maybe it's 7.45 mmHg.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the initial calculations again to ensure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nResearcher A: 8 / 4 = 2\n\nResearcher B: 12 / 9 \u2248 1.3333\n\nResearcher C: 6 / 2.25 \u2248 2.6667\n\nSum of these: 2 + 1.3333 + 2.6667 = 6\n\nSum of weights: 0.25 + 0.1111 + 0.4444 = 0.8055\n\n6 / 0.8055 \u2248 7.448, which is approximately 7.45 mmHg\n\nI think that's correct. So, the overall mean reduction is about 7.45 mmHg.\n</think>\n\nThe overall mean reduction in blood pressure across the three studies is approximately 7.45 mmHg.\n\nDONE."

    "solution": "Solve this problem step by step. End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: Three researchers conducted separate studies examining whether a new medication reduces blood pressure in patients with hypertension. Their results were as follows:\n\nResearcher A: 120 participants; mean reduction of 8 mmHg; standard error of 2 mmHg\nResearcher B: 80 participants; mean reduction of 12 mmHg; standard error of 3 mmHg\nResearcher C: 200 participants; mean reduction of 6 mmHg; standard error of 1.5 mmHg\n\nYou want to perform a simple fixed-effects meta-analysis to determine the overall effect of this medication. In a fixed-effects meta-analysis, each study is weighted by the inverse of its variance (where variance = standard error\u00b2), and the overall effect estimate is calculated as the sum of weighted effects divided by the sum of weights.\n\nWhat is the overall mean reduction in blood pressure across these three studies? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out the overall mean reduction in blood pressure across these three studies using a fixed-effects meta-analysis. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that in a fixed-effects model, each study is weighted by the inverse of its variance. The variance is calculated as the standard error squared. So, I need to find the variance for each researcher and then take the reciprocal of that to get the weight for each study.\n\nLet me jot down the details for each researcher:\n\n- Researcher A: 120 participants, mean reduction 8 mmHg, standard error 2 mmHg\n- Researcher B: 80 participants, mean reduction 12 mmHg, standard error 3 mmHg\n- Researcher C: 200 participants, mean reduction 6 mmHg, standard error 1.5 mmHg\n\nOkay, so for each researcher, I'll calculate the variance, then the weight, and then sum up the weights and the weighted mean reductions.\n\nStarting with Researcher A:\n- Variance = (Standard Error)^2 = 2^2 = 4\n- Weight = 1 / Variance = 1 / 4 = 0.25\n\nResearcher B:\n- Variance = 3^2 = 9\n- Weight = 1 / 9 \u2248 0.1111\n\nResearcher C:\n- Variance = 1.5^2 = 2.25\n- Weight = 1 / 2.25 \u2248 0.4444\n\nNow, I'll sum up the weights:\nTotal weight = 0.25 + 0.1111 + 0.4444 \u2248 0.8055\n\nNext, I need to sum up the weighted mean reductions:\n- For A: 8 mmHg * 0.25 = 2 mmHg\n- For B: 12 mmHg * 0.1111 \u2248 1.3333 mmHg\n- For C: 6 mmHg * 0.4444 \u2248 2.6666 mmHg\n\nAdding these up: 2 + 1.3333 + 2.6666 \u2248 6.0 mmHg\n\nWait, that adds up exactly to 6.0? That seems a bit neat. Let me double-check the calculations.\n\nCalculations:\n\nResearcher A:\n- Weight = 1 / (2^2) = 1/4 = 0.25\n- Contribution: 8 * 0.25 = 2 mmHg\n\nResearcher B:\n- Weight = 1 / (3^2) = 1/9 \u2248 0.1111\n- Contribution: 12 * 0.1111 \u2248 1.3333 mmHg\n\nResearcher C:\n- Weight = 1 / (1.5^2) = 1/2.25 \u2248 0.4444\n- Contribution: 6 * 0.4444 \u2248 2.6666 mmHg\n\nTotal weighted sum: 2 + 1.3333 + 2.6666 \u2248 6.0 mmHg\n\nTotal weight: 0.25 + 0.1111 + 0.4444 \u2248 0.8055\n\nSo, overall mean reduction = 6.0 / 0.8055 \u2248 7.45 mmHg\n\nWait, that's different from my initial calculation. I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me recalculate the total weighted sum and then divide by the total weight.\n\nTotal weighted sum: 2 + 1.3333 + 2.6666 = 6.0 mmHg\n\nTotal weight: 0.25 + 0.1111 + 0.4444 = 0.8055\n\nSo, 6.0 / 0.8055 \u2248 7.45 mmHg\n\nHmm, so the overall mean reduction is approximately 7.45 mmHg.\n\nWait, but let me confirm if I did the weighting correctly. Fixed effects meta-analysis weights each study by the inverse of its variance, which is indeed 1/(standard error squared). So, yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes people use the reciprocal of the sample size, but no, in fixed effects, it's the inverse of the variance, which accounts for the standard error.\n\nAlternatively, if I use the sample sizes as weights, the result would be different, but that's not what fixed effects meta-analysis does. Fixed effects uses the inverse variance weights.\n\nSo, I think my calculation is correct.\n\nTherefore, the overall mean reduction is approximately 7.45 mmHg.\n</think>\n\nTo perform a fixed-effects meta-analysis, each study is weighted by the inverse of its variance. The overall effect is calculated by summing the weighted effects and dividing by the sum of weights.\n\n1. **Calculate Variance and Weights:**\n   - **Researcher A:** Variance = 4, Weight = 0.25\n   - **Researcher B:** Variance = 9, Weight \u2248 0.1111\n   - **Researcher C:** Variance = 2.25, Weight \u2248 0.4444\n\n2. **Sum of Weights:** 0.25 + 0.1111 + 0.4444 \u2248 0.8055\n\n3. **Sum of Weighted Effects:**\n   - A: 8 * 0.25 = 2 mmHg\n   - B: 12 * 0.1111 \u2248 1.3333 mmHg\n   - C: 6 * 0.4444 \u2248 2.6666 mmHg\n   - Total = 2 + 1.3333 + 2.6666 \u2248 6.0 mmHg\n\n4. **Overall Mean Reduction:** 6.0 / 0.8055 \u2248 7.45 mmHg\n\nThe overall mean reduction in blood pressure across the three studies is approximately **7.45 mmHg**.\n\nDONE."
