End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: Three researchers conducted separate studies examining whether a new medication reduces blood pressure in patients with hypertension. Their results were as follows:\n\nResearcher A: 120 participants; mean reduction of 8 mmHg; standard error of 2 mmHg\nResearcher B: 80 participants; mean reduction of 12 mmHg; standard error of 3 mmHg\nResearcher C: 200 participants; mean reduction of 6 mmHg; standard error of 1.5 mmHg\n\nYou want to perform a simple fixed-effects meta-analysis to determine the overall effect of this medication. In a fixed-effects meta-analysis, each study is weighted by the inverse of its variance (where variance = standard error\u00b2), and the overall effect estimate is calculated as the sum of weighted effects divided by the sum of weights.\n\nWhat is the overall mean reduction in blood pressure across these three studies? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out the overall mean reduction in blood pressure from these three studies using a fixed-effects meta-analysis. Hmm, okay, fixed-effects meta-analysis... I remember that in fixed effects, each study is weighted by the inverse of its variance, which is the standard error squared. That makes sense because larger studies (with more participants) tend to have smaller standard errors, so they should have a bigger weight, right? \n\nLet me break down the data first. There are three researchers: A, B, and C. Each has their own number of participants, mean reduction in blood pressure, and standard error. \n\nResearcher A: 120 participants, mean reduction of 8 mmHg, standard error of 2 mmHg.\nResearcher B: 80 participants, mean reduction of 12 mmHg, standard error of 3 mmHg.\nResearcher C: 200 participants, mean reduction of 6 mmHg, standard error of 1.5 mmHg.\n\nOkay, so for each researcher, I need to calculate the weight, which is 1 divided by the variance (standard error squared). Then, I'll sum up all the weights and divide the total weighted mean reduction by the total weight to get the overall effect estimate.\n\nLet me start with Researcher A. Their standard error is 2 mmHg, so variance is 2 squared, which is 4. Therefore, the weight is 1/4, which is 0.25.\n\nNext, Researcher B has a standard error of 3 mmHg. So variance is 9, and the weight is 1/9, approximately 0.1111.\n\nResearcher C has a standard error of 1.5 mmHg. Squaring that gives 2.25. So the weight is 1/2.25, which is approximately 0.4444.\n\nNow, I need to sum up these weights. Let me calculate that:\n\n0.25 (A) + 0.1111 (B) + 0.4444 (C) = \n\n0.25 + 0.1111 is 0.3611, and adding 0.4444 gives 0.8055. So the total weight is approximately 0.8055.\n\nNow, I need to calculate the total weighted mean reduction. That means I multiply each mean reduction by its respective weight and then sum them up.\n\nFor Researcher A: 8 mmHg * 0.25 = 2 mmHg.\nFor Researcher B: 12 mmHg * 0.1111 \u2248 1.3333 mmHg.\nFor Researcher C: 6 mmHg * 0.4444 \u2248 2.6666 mmHg.\n\nAdding these up: 2 + 1.3333 + 2.6666 = 6 mmHg.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So the overall mean reduction is 6 mmHg.\n\nBut let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nCalculating the weights again:\n\nResearcher A: 1/(2^2) = 0.25\nResearcher B: 1/(3^2) \u2248 0.1111\nResearcher C: 1/(1.5^2) = 1/2.25 \u2248 0.4444\n\nTotal weight: 0.25 + 0.1111 + 0.4444 = 0.8055\n\nTotal weighted mean:\n\n8 * 0.25 = 2\n12 * 0.1111 \u2248 1.3333\n6 * 0.4444 \u2248 2.6666\n\nAdding them: 2 + 1.3333 + 2.6666 = 6 mmHg.\n\nYeah, that seems correct. So the overall mean reduction is 6 mmHg.\n</think>\n\nThe overall mean reduction in blood pressure across the three studies is calculated by weighting each study's effect by the inverse of its variance (standard error squared) and then summing these weighted effects and dividing by the total weight. \n\n- **Weight for Researcher A**: 1 / (2\u00b2) = 0.25\n- **Weight for Researcher B**: 1 / (3\u00b2) \u2248 0.1111\n- **Weight for Researcher C**: 1 / (1.5\u00b2) \u2248 0.4444\n\nTotal weight = 0.25 + 0.1111 + 0.4444 \u2248 0.8055\n\nTotal weighted mean reduction = (8 * 0.25) + (12 * 0.1111) + (6 * 0.4444) \u2248 2 + 1.3333 + 2.6666 = 6 mmHg\n\n**Answer:** The overall mean reduction in blood pressure is 6 mmHg.\n\nDONE."
