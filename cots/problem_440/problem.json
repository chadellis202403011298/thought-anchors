  "question": "Three researchers conducted separate studies examining whether a new medication reduces blood pressure in patients with hypertension. Their results were as follows:\n\nResearcher A: 120 participants; mean reduction of 8 mmHg; standard error of 2 mmHg\nResearcher B: 80 participants; mean reduction of 12 mmHg; standard error of 3 mmHg\nResearcher C: 200 participants; mean reduction of 6 mmHg; standard error of 1.5 mmHg\n\nYou want to perform a simple fixed-effects meta-analysis to determine the overall effect of this medication. In a fixed-effects meta-analysis, each study is weighted by the inverse of its variance (where variance = standard error\u00b2), and the overall effect estimate is calculated as the sum of weighted effects divided by the sum of weights.\n\nWhat is the overall mean reduction in blood pressure across these three studies?",
  "answer": "To perform a fixed-effects meta-analysis, I need to:\n\n1. Calculate the weight for each study (inverse of variance)\n2. Multiply each study's effect size by its weight\n3. Add up these weighted effects\n4. Divide by the sum of all weights\n\nStep 1: Calculate each study's variance and weight.\n- Study A: Variance = SE\u00b2 = 2\u00b2 = 4; Weight = 1/4 = 0.25\n- Study B: Variance = SE\u00b2 = 3\u00b2 = 9; Weight = 1/9 = 0.111...\n- Study C: Variance = SE\u00b2 = 1.5\u00b2 = 2.25; Weight = 1/2.25 = 0.444...\n\nStep 2: Multiply each effect by its corresponding weight.\n- Study A: 8 mmHg \u00d7 0.25 = 2 mmHg\n- Study B: 12 mmHg \u00d7 0.111... = 1.333... mmHg\n- Study C: 6 mmHg \u00d7 0.444... = 2.667... mmHg\n\nStep 3: Calculate the sum of weighted effects.\n2 + 1.333... + 2.667... = 6 mmHg\n\nStep 4: Calculate the sum of weights.\n0.25 + 0.111... + 0.444... = 0.806...\n\nStep 5: Calculate the overall effect estimate.\nOverall effect = Sum of weighted effects / Sum of weights\nOverall effect = 6 / 0.806... = 7.44 mmHg\n\nTherefore, the overall mean reduction in blood pressure across the three studies is approximately 7.44 mmHg."
