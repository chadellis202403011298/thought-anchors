  "question": "A man lives on the 10th floor of an apartment building. Every morning he takes the elevator down to the ground floor to go to work. When he returns in the evening, he takes the elevator to the 7th floor and then uses the stairs for the remaining floors. However, when it's raining or when there are other people in the elevator, he goes directly to the 10th floor. Why does he do this?",
  "answer": "The man is of short stature and cannot reach the button for the 10th floor in the elevator. He can only reach as high as the 7th floor button.\n\nReasoning process:\n1. First, we need to identify what's unusual about his behavior - he only goes to the 7th floor on normal days, but goes all the way to the 10th floor when it's raining or when others are in the elevator.\n2. We need to think about what could be different in those situations.\n3. When other people are in the elevator, they might press the 10th floor button for him.\n4. When it's raining, he might be carrying an umbrella, which he could use to reach the 10th floor button.\n5. This suggests the man has a physical limitation - he cannot reach the 10th floor button on his own.\n6. The most logical explanation is that he is not tall enough to reach the 10th floor button, so he can only press up to the 7th floor by himself."
