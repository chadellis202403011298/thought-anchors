  "question": "A man walks into a restaurant, sits down, and orders albatross soup. After taking one taste, he gets up, walks outside, and takes his own life. Why did the man kill himself after tasting the soup?",
  "answer": "The man had been stranded on a remote island years ago with his wife and several others after a shipwreck. During their time there, his wife died, and a fellow survivor brought him what they claimed was albatross soup to help him through his grief. He eventually was rescued and continued with his life.\n\nYears later, he ordered albatross soup at the restaurant, and upon tasting it, realized it tasted nothing like what he had on the island. This made him instantly understand that what he had actually eaten on the island wasn't albatross at all, but was in fact his deceased wife (prepared by the other survivor). The realization was so horrifying that he took his own life.\n\nThis problem requires breaking the assumption that the soup itself was the direct cause of suicide. Instead, it was what the soup revealed to the man by being different from his previous experience. It also requires breaking the assumption that his past experience with 'albatross soup' was actually albatross."
