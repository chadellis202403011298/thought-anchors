  "question": "A small town has six neighborhoods connected by roads. The connections are as follows:\n- Downtown is connected to Riverside, Hillcrest, and Eastside\n- Riverside is connected to Downtown and Westside\n- Hillcrest is connected to Downtown and Parkview\n- Eastside is connected to Downtown and Parkview\n- Westside is connected to Riverside\n- Parkview is connected to Hillcrest and Eastside\n\nThe town council wants to establish emergency service centers that can reach any neighborhood within one connection. What is the minimum number of emergency service centers needed, and in which neighborhoods should they be placed to ensure full coverage of the town?",
  "answer": "To solve this problem, I need to find the minimum number of locations that will allow access to all neighborhoods within one connection.\n\nStep 1: Visualize the network of neighborhoods and connections.\nThe six neighborhoods (Downtown, Riverside, Hillcrest, Eastside, Westside, and Parkview) are the nodes, and the roads between them are the edges.\n\nStep 2: Determine the reach of each potential service center location.\nIf a service center is placed in a neighborhood, it can serve that neighborhood and all directly connected neighborhoods.\n- Downtown can serve: Downtown, Riverside, Hillcrest, and Eastside (4 total)\n- Riverside can serve: Riverside, Downtown, and Westside (3 total)\n- Hillcrest can serve: Hillcrest, Downtown, and Parkview (3 total)\n- Eastside can serve: Eastside, Downtown, and Parkview (3 total)\n- Westside can serve: Westside and Riverside (2 total)\n- Parkview can serve: Parkview, Hillcrest, and Eastside (3 total)\n\nStep 3: Find the minimum set of neighborhoods that covers all others.\nThis is a set cover problem. Downtown has the greatest reach (4 neighborhoods), but it doesn't cover Westside and Parkview. I need to add another location to cover these.\n\nIf I place centers in Downtown and Parkview:\n- Downtown covers: Downtown, Riverside, Hillcrest, and Eastside\n- Parkview covers: Parkview, Hillcrest, and Eastside (but Hillcrest and Eastside are already covered)\n\nThis doesn't cover Westside. I need a different combination.\n\nIf I place centers in Downtown and Riverside:\n- Downtown covers: Downtown, Riverside, Hillcrest, and Eastside\n- Riverside covers: Riverside, Downtown, and Westside (but Downtown and Riverside are already covered)\n\nThis covers all neighborhoods except Parkview. I need one more center.\n\nIf I place centers in Downtown, Riverside, and Parkview:\n- Downtown covers: Downtown, Riverside, Hillcrest, and Eastside\n- Riverside covers: Riverside, Downtown, and Westside (only Westside adds new coverage)\n- Parkview covers: Parkview, Hillcrest, and Eastside (only Parkview adds new coverage)\n\nThis covers all six neighborhoods.\n\nStep 4: Check if there's a more efficient solution.\nIf I place centers in Riverside and Parkview:\n- Riverside covers: Riverside, Downtown, and Westside\n- Parkview covers: Parkview, Hillcrest, and Eastside\n\nThis covers all six neighborhoods with just two centers.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of emergency service centers needed is 2, and they should be placed in Riverside and Parkview neighborhoods."
