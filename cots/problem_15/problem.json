  "question": "A small ice cream shop offers three flavors: vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry. Based on past sales, the owner knows that 40% of customers choose vanilla, 35% choose chocolate, and 25% choose strawberry. The profit margins are $1.50 per vanilla cone, $1.75 per chocolate cone, and $2.00 per strawberry cone. If a customer walks in randomly, what is the expected profit from selling them a single ice cream cone?",
  "answer": "To find the expected profit, we need to calculate the weighted average of the possible profits, where the weights are the probabilities of each outcome.\n\nGiven information:\n- Probability of vanilla = 0.40 with a profit of $1.50\n- Probability of chocolate = 0.35 with a profit of $1.75\n- Probability of strawberry = 0.25 with a profit of $2.00\n\nThe expected value formula is: E(X) = \u03a3(x_i \u00d7 p_i) where x_i represents each possible value, and p_i represents the probability of that value occurring.\n\nSubstituting our values:\nE(profit) = (0.40 \u00d7 $1.50) + (0.35 \u00d7 $1.75) + (0.25 \u00d7 $2.00)\nE(profit) = $0.60 + $0.6125 + $0.50\nE(profit) = $1.7125\n\nTherefore, the expected profit from selling a single ice cream cone to a random customer is $1.71 (rounded to the nearest cent)."
