  "answer": "To construct a square with line segment AB as one of its sides, I'll follow these steps:\n\n1. Start with the given line segment AB.\n\n2. Use the compass to draw a circle centered at point A with radius equal to the length of AB.\n\n3. Use the compass to draw a circle centered at point B with radius equal to the length of AB.\n\n4. From point A, draw a line perpendicular to AB. This can be done by:\n   a. Setting the compass to any radius greater than half of AB\n   b. Drawing arcs above and below line AB from both points A and B\n   c. Drawing a line through the two points where these arcs intersect\n   d. This line is perpendicular to AB at point A\n\n5. The intersection of this perpendicular line with the circle centered at A gives point D.\n\n6. Similarly, construct a perpendicular line to AB from point B, which intersects the circle centered at B at point C.\n\n7. Draw line segments DC and CD to complete the square ABCD.\n\nThis works because:\n- All sides are equal to AB (by construction using circles with radius AB)\n- All angles are 90\u00b0 (by construction of perpendicular lines)\n\nThese properties ensure we've constructed a square with AB as one side."
