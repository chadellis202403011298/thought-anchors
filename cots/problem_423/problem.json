  "question": "Use proof by contradiction to prove the following statement: If n is an integer and n\u00b2 is even, then n is even.",
  "answer": "To prove this by contradiction, I'll assume the opposite of the conclusion and show it leads to a logical contradiction.\n\n1. First, I'll state the original claim: If n is an integer and n\u00b2 is even, then n is even.\n\n2. To set up a proof by contradiction, I'll assume the premise is true but the conclusion is false. That is:\n   - n is an integer and n\u00b2 is even (premise is true)\n   - n is not even (negation of the conclusion)\n\n3. If n is not even, then n must be odd (since every integer is either even or odd).\n\n4. If n is odd, then n = 2k + 1 for some integer k.\n\n5. Now I'll calculate n\u00b2:\n   n\u00b2 = (2k + 1)\u00b2\n   n\u00b2 = 4k\u00b2 + 4k + 1\n   n\u00b2 = 2(2k\u00b2 + 2k) + 1\n\n6. Notice that 2(2k\u00b2 + 2k) is clearly even (as it's a multiple of 2).\n\n7. Therefore, n\u00b2 = 2(2k\u00b2 + 2k) + 1 is odd (as it's an even number plus 1).\n\n8. But this contradicts our initial premise that n\u00b2 is even.\n\n9. Since assuming that n is odd led to a contradiction, our assumption must be false.\n\n10. Therefore, if n\u00b2 is even, n must be even, which is what we wanted to prove."
