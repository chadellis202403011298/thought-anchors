End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: Use proof by contradiction to prove the following statement: If n is an integer and n\u00b2 is even, then n is even. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this problem to prove that if n is an integer and n squared is even, then n must be even. And I need to use proof by contradiction. Hmm, okay, let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that proof by contradiction works by assuming the opposite of what we want to prove and then showing that this leads to a contradiction. So, in this case, the statement is \"If n is an integer and n\u00b2 is even, then n is even.\" The opposite of this statement would be that n is an integer, n\u00b2 is even, but n is odd. So, I'll start by assuming that n is odd.\n\nWait, but n is an integer, so if n is odd, then n can be written as 2k + 1 for some integer k. Yeah, that's the standard form for odd integers. So, let me write that down: n = 2k + 1, where k is an integer.\n\nNow, if n is odd, then n squared would be (2k + 1) squared. Let me compute that: (2k + 1)\u00b2 = 4k\u00b2 + 4k + 1. Okay, so n\u00b2 = 4k\u00b2 + 4k + 1.\n\nBut the problem states that n\u00b2 is even. So, 4k\u00b2 + 4k + 1 is even. Let me think about that. 4k\u00b2 is clearly even because it's 4 times something, which is even. Similarly, 4k is also even for the same reason. So, adding two even numbers, 4k\u00b2 and 4k, gives another even number. Then we add 1, which is odd. So, even + odd = odd. Therefore, n\u00b2 would be odd.\n\nWait, but the problem says that n\u00b2 is even. So, we have a contradiction because we started by assuming that n is odd, which led us to n\u00b2 being odd, but n\u00b2 is supposed to be even. That's a contradiction because something can't be both even and odd at the same time.\n\nTherefore, our initial assumption that n is odd must be false. So, n must be even. That's the conclusion we wanted. So, by assuming the opposite and reaching a contradiction, we've proven that if n\u00b2 is even, then n must be even.\n\nI think that covers it. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. Assume n is odd, express it as 2k + 1, square it, and show that the square is odd, which contradicts the given that n\u00b2 is even. Hence, n can't be odd, so it must be even. Yep, that seems solid.\n</think>\n\nAlright, let's break this down step by step using proof by contradiction.\n\n**Step 1: Assume the opposite of the statement.**\nWe want to prove that if \\( n \\) is an integer and \\( n^2 \\) is even, then \\( n \\) is even. To use proof by contradiction, we'll assume the opposite: that \\( n \\) is odd.\n\n**Step 2: Express the odd integer \\( n \\) in terms of an integer \\( k \\).**\nAn odd integer can be written as \\( n = 2k + 1 \\), where \\( k \\) is an integer.\n\n**Step 3: Compute \\( n^2 \\) using the expression from Step 2.**\n\\[\nn^2 = (2k + 1)^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1\n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the parity (evenness or oddness) of \\( n^2 \\).**\n- \\( 4k^2 \\) is even because it's a multiple of 4.\n- \\( 4k \\) is also even for the same reason.\n- Adding two even numbers: \\( 4k^2 + 4k \\) is even.\n- Adding 1 (an odd number) to an even number: \\( 4k^2 + 4k + 1 \\) is odd.\n\n**Step 5: Reach a contradiction.**\nWe were given that \\( n^2 \\) is even. However, from Step 4, we found that \\( n^2 \\) is odd. This contradiction implies that our initial assumption\u2014that \\( n \\) is odd\u2014is false.\n\n**Step 6: Conclude the proof.**\nSince assuming \\( n \\) is odd leads to a contradiction, the original statement must be true: if \\( n \\) is an integer and \\( n^2 \\) is even, then \\( n \\) is even.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nDONE."

Hmm, but wait, I have to use proof by contradiction. Alright, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that proof by contradiction works by assuming the opposite of what we want to prove and then showing that this assumption leads to a contradiction. So, in this case, the statement is \"If n is an integer and n\u00b2 is even, then n is even.\" \n\nSo, let's break it down. The hypothesis is that n\u00b2 is even, and we need to conclude that n is even. But I need to use contradiction, so I should assume the opposite of what I want to prove. That would be: assume that n is odd, and then show that if n is odd, n\u00b2 must be odd, which would contradict the given that n\u00b2 is even. \n\nWait, let me make sure I'm setting this up right. The original statement is an implication: If P, then Q. In this case, P is \"n is an integer and n\u00b2 is even,\" and Q is \"n is even.\" To prove this by contradiction, I need to negate the implication. The negation of \"If P, then Q\" is \"P and not Q.\" So, the statement becomes: There exists an integer n such that n\u00b2 is even and n is odd. \n\nSo, in logical terms, \u00ac(P \u2192 Q) is equivalent to P \u2227 \u00acQ. Therefore, to prove by contradiction, I can assume that P \u2227 \u00acQ is true and then derive a contradiction from that assumption. \n\nAlright, so let's formalize this. Let me define P as \"n is an integer and n\u00b2 is even,\" and Q as \"n is even.\" So, we need to assume that P is true and Q is false, meaning n is an integer, n\u00b2 is even, and n is odd. \n\nNow, I need to show that this assumption leads to a contradiction. Let's recall that an integer is either even or odd. If n is odd, then it can be written as 2k + 1 for some integer k. So, let me express n as 2k + 1. Then, n\u00b2 would be (2k + 1)\u00b2. Let me compute that: \n\n(2k + 1)\u00b2 = 4k\u00b2 + 4k + 1 = 4k(k + 1) + 1.\n\nHmm, interesting. So, n\u00b2 is equal to 4k(k + 1) + 1. Now, 4k(k + 1) is clearly even because it's a multiple of 4, and 4k(k + 1) is divisible by 2 as well. So, 4k(k + 1) is even, and adding 1 to an even number gives an odd number. Therefore, n\u00b2 is odd.\n\nBut wait, our assumption was that n\u00b2 is even. So, we have a contradiction here. Because if n is odd, then n\u00b2 must be odd, but we assumed that n\u00b2 is even. This can't be true at the same time. Therefore, our initial assumption must be false, which means that if n\u00b2 is even, then n cannot be odd. Hence, n must be even.\n\nLet me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. I started by assuming that n is odd and n\u00b2 is even. Then, I expressed n as 2k + 1 and squared it, resulting in 4k\u00b2 + 4k + 1. Breaking that down, I saw that 4k\u00b2 + 4k is even, so adding 1 makes it odd. Therefore, n\u00b2 is odd, which contradicts the given that n\u00b2 is even. So, the assumption that n is odd while n\u00b2 is even must be false, proving that n must be even.\n\nI think that makes sense. I don't see any errors in the logic. The key step was expressing n as 2k + 1 and then computing n\u00b2, which showed that it's odd. Since our assumption was that n\u00b2 is even, this leads to a contradiction. Therefore, the original statement holds true by contradiction.\n</think>\n\nTo prove that if \\( n \\) is an integer and \\( n^2 \\) is even, then \\( n \\) is even by contradiction:\n\n1. **Assume the opposite**: Suppose \\( n \\) is odd. Then, \\( n \\) can be expressed as \\( 2k + 1 \\) for some integer \\( k \\).\n\n2. **Compute \\( n^2 \\)**: \n   \\[\n   n^2 = (2k + 1)^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1\n   \\]\n   Simplifying, \\( n^2 = 4k(k + 1) + 1 \\).\n\n3. **Analyze the parity**:\n   - \\( 4k(k + 1) \\) is even because it is a multiple of 4.\n   - Adding 1 to an even number results in an odd number.\n\n4. **Contradiction**: Since \\( n^2 \\) is even (given), but we derived that \\( n^2 \\) is odd, this is a contradiction.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The assumption that \\( n \\) is odd leads to a contradiction. Therefore, \\( n \\) must be even.\n\nDONE."

Hmm, the problem suggests using proof by contradiction, which means I should assume the opposite of what I want to prove and then show that this assumption leads to a contradiction.\n\nAlright, let me start by writing down what I know. I know that an integer is any whole number, positive or negative, including zero. Now, an even number is any integer that can be written as 2 times another integer, right? So, if n is even, then n = 2k for some integer k. That makes sense.\n\nNow, the statement says that if n squared is even, then n is even. Let me think about what n squared being even implies. If n squared is even, that means n\u00b2 is divisible by 2. So, n\u00b2 = 2m for some integer m.\n\nBut wait, I need to prove that n must be even if n\u00b2 is even. Maybe I should assume the opposite and see where that leads me. So, let's assume that n is odd. If n is odd, then it can be written as 2k + 1 for some integer k. That's the standard form for odd numbers.\n\nIf n is 2k + 1, then n squared would be (2k + 1)\u00b2. Let me expand that. (2k + 1)\u00b2 = 4k\u00b2 + 4k + 1. Hmm, so n\u00b2 = 4k\u00b2 + 4k + 1. Now, looking at this expression, 4k\u00b2 and 4k are both multiples of 4, right? So, 4k\u00b2 + 4k is divisible by 4, and then we have +1. So, n\u00b2 = 4(k\u00b2 + k) + 1.\n\nWait a second, if n\u00b2 is 4(k\u00b2 + k) + 1, that means n\u00b2 is one more than a multiple of 4. So, n\u00b2 is congruent to 1 modulo 4. But earlier, we assumed that n\u00b2 is even, which means n\u00b2 is divisible by 2. But if n\u00b2 is congruent to 1 modulo 4, that tells us something about its divisibility by 2.\n\nLet me think about this. If n\u00b2 is congruent to 1 mod 4, then it's odd because 1 mod 4 is an odd number. But wait, we were told that n\u00b2 is even. So, we have a contradiction here because n\u00b2 cannot be both even and odd at the same time. That's a problem.\n\nSo, our initial assumption that n is odd leads us to conclude that n\u00b2 is odd, which contradicts the given that n\u00b2 is even. Therefore, our assumption that n is odd must be false. Hence, n must be even.\n\nWait, did I make a mistake here? Let me double-check. If n is odd, then n = 2k + 1, and n\u00b2 = 4k\u00b2 + 4k + 1, which is indeed 1 more than a multiple of 4, so it's odd. But the problem states that n\u00b2 is even, so that's a contradiction. Therefore, n cannot be odd, so n must be even.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, by assuming that n is odd, we derived that n\u00b2 is odd, which contradicts the given that n\u00b2 is even. Therefore, our initial assumption is wrong, and n must be even. That's a solid proof by contradiction.\n</think>\n\nAlright, let me lay out the proof step by step.\n\n**Proof by Contradiction:**\n\n*Statement to Prove:* If \\( n \\) is an integer and \\( n^2 \\) is even, then \\( n \\) is even.\n\n**Step 1:** Assume the opposite of what we want to prove.

The problem suggests using proof by contradiction, which I remember is a method where you assume the opposite of what you want to prove and then show that this assumption leads to a contradiction. That contradiction would then prove the original statement.\n\nOkay, let's break it down. First, the statement is: If n is an integer and n\u00b2 is even, then n is even. So, in logical terms, it's saying that if n\u00b2 is even, then n must be even. \n\nTo use proof by contradiction, I need to assume the opposite of what I want to prove. That means I should assume that n is not even, and then show that this leads to a contradiction. If n is not even, then it must be odd because integers are either even or odd. So, my assumption is that n is odd.\n\nNow, if n is odd, then n can be expressed as 2k + 1, where k is some integer. I remember that from algebra. So, n = 2k + 1.\n\nNext, I need to compute n squared. If n is 2k + 1, then n\u00b2 would be (2k + 1) squared. Let me expand that. (2k + 1)\u00b2 equals (2k)\u00b2 + 2*(2k)*(1) + (1)\u00b2, which is 4k\u00b2 + 4k + 1.\n\nSo, n\u00b2 = 4k\u00b2 + 4k + 1. Now, I need to analyze whether this is even or odd. Let's see, 4k\u00b2 is obviously even because it's a multiple of 4. Similarly, 4k is also even. Adding two even numbers together gives another even number. So, 4k\u00b2 + 4k is even. Then, adding 1 to an even number makes it odd. Therefore, n\u00b2 is odd.\n\nBut wait, the original statement says that n\u00b2 is even. So, if n is odd, then n\u00b2 is odd, which contradicts the given condition that n\u00b2 is even. This contradiction arises from our initial assumption that n is odd.

I started by assuming n is odd, expressed n as 2k + 1, squared it, and showed that n\u00b2 becomes odd. Since the problem states that n\u00b2 is even, this assumption leads to a contradiction. Hence, n cannot be odd, so it must be even. \n\nI think that covers it. I don't see any gaps in the logic.

So, in this case, I need to assume that n is not even, but n squared is even, and then see if that leads to a contradiction.\n\nWait, but what does it mean for a number to be even or odd? An even integer is any integer that can be written as 2 times another integer, right? So, if n is even, then n = 2k for some integer k. If n is odd, then n = 2k + 1 for some integer k.\n\nSo, the statement says that if n squared is even, then n must be even. To use proof by contradiction, I should assume the opposite, which is that n is odd, and n squared is even. If I can show that this assumption is impossible, then the original statement must be true.\n\nOkay, let's set up the contradiction. Let's assume that n is odd. Then, as I mentioned, n can be written as 2k + 1 for some integer k. Now, let's compute n squared under this assumption.\n\nn\u00b2 = (2k + 1)\u00b2 = 4k\u00b2 + 4k + 1. Hmm, let's simplify that. 4k\u00b2 + 4k is equal to 4(k\u00b2 + k), which is clearly divisible by 4. So, n squared is 4(k\u00b2 + k) + 1, which is 1 more than a multiple of 4.\n\nWait, if n squared is 1 more than a multiple of 4, then n squared is congruent to 1 modulo 4. So, n\u00b2 \u2261 1 mod 4. But if n squared is even, then n squared must be divisible by 2, right? Because even numbers are multiples of 2.\n\nBut hold on, if n squared is congruent to 1 mod 4, that means when you divide n squared by 4, the remainder is 1. So, n squared is an odd number because it's 1 more than an even number (since 4(k\u00b2 + k) is even). But that's a problem because the original statement says that n squared is even, which would mean n squared is divisible by 2.\n\nBut here's the thing: if n squared is both even (divisible by 2) and congruent to 1 mod 4, which implies it's odd, that's a contradiction. Because an even number can't be congruent to 1 mod 4. Let me check that again.\n\nIf n is odd, then n\u00b2 is 1 mod 4, which means n\u00b2 is odd. But we were given that n\u00b2 is even, so that's a contradiction. Therefore, our initial assumption that n is odd must be false. Hence, n must be even.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake there. So, assuming n is odd leads to n\u00b2 being odd, which contradicts the given that n\u00b2 is even. Therefore, n cannot be odd, so it must be even. Yeah, that seems to check out.\n\nI think that's the correct approach.

So, in this case, I need to assume that n is an integer, n squared is even, but n itself is odd. If I can show that this assumption leads to a contradiction, then the original statement must be true.\n\nAlright, let's break it down. Let me write down what I know:\n\n1. n is an integer.\n2. n\u00b2 is even.\n\nI need to prove that n is even. So, the opposite of n being even is n being odd. Therefore, my assumption for contradiction will be that n is odd.\n\nWait, but how do I know n is odd? Well, by definition, an odd integer can be written as 2k + 1, where k is an integer. So, let me express n as 2k + 1.\n\nNow, if n is 2k + 1, then n squared would be (2k + 1) squared. Let me compute that:\n\nn\u00b2 = (2k + 1)\u00b2 = 4k\u00b2 + 4k + 1.\n\nHmm, so n squared is 4k\u00b2 + 4k + 1. Let me see if this can be even or not. Well, 4k\u00b2 is definitely even because it's a multiple of 4. Similarly, 4k is also even. So, adding two even numbers gives me another even number. Then, adding 1 to an even number makes it odd.\n\nWait a minute, that means n squared is odd. But the problem says that n squared is even. So, if I assume that n is odd, I end up with n squared being odd, which contradicts the given that n squared is even. That's a contradiction! Therefore, my initial assumption that n is odd must be wrong. So, n has to be even.\n\nLet me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. If n is even, then n can be written as 2k. Squaring that, we get (2k)\u00b2 = 4k\u00b2, which is clearly even. So, that fits with the given that n squared is even. And if n were odd, as I showed earlier, n squared would be odd, which doesn't fit. So, the only possibility is that n is even.\n\nI think that makes sense. By assuming the opposite, I arrived at a contradiction, so the original statement must be true. Yeah, I'm pretty confident with this approach.\nDONE.\n</think>\n\nAlright, let's go through the proof step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Assume the Contrary**\nSuppose, for the sake of contradiction, that \\( n \\) is an odd integer. By definition, an odd integer can be expressed as:\n\\[ n = 2k + 1 \\]\nwhere \\( k \\) is an integer.\n\n**Step 2: Compute \\( n^2 \\)**\nSquare both sides of the equation:\n\\[ n^2 = (2k + 1)^2 \\]\nExpand the right-hand side:\n\\[ n^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1 \\]\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Parity of \\( n^2 \\)**\nNotice that \\( 4k^2 \\) and \\( 4k \\) are both even numbers since they are multiples of 4.

End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: Use proof by contradiction to prove the following statement: If n is an integer and n\u00b2 is even, then n is even. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I need to prove that if n is an integer and n squared is even, then n must be even. The problem suggests using proof by contradiction. Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that proof by contradiction works by assuming the opposite of what we want to prove and then showing that this leads to a contradiction. So, in this case, I should assume that n is an integer, and n squared is even, but n itself is odd. Then, if I can show that this assumption leads to a contradiction, that would prove that our original statement must be true.\n\nWait, let me write that down more clearly. Let's assume the opposite of what we want to prove. So, the original statement is: If n is an integer and n\u00b2 is even, then n is even. The opposite would be: n is an integer, n\u00b2 is even, but n is odd. If I can show that this opposite leads to a contradiction, then the original statement must be true.\n\nOkay, so let's define what we're assuming. Let n be an integer such that n\u00b2 is even, but n is odd. Now, I need to explore the implications of this assumption.\n\nI know that an even number can be written as 2k, where k is an integer, and an odd number can be written as 2k + 1, where k is also an integer. So, if n is odd, then n can be expressed as 2k + 1 for some integer k.\n\nNow, let's compute n squared under this assumption. So, n\u00b2 would be (2k + 1)\u00b2. Expanding that, we get 4k\u00b2 + 4k + 1. Hmm, that simplifies to 4k\u00b2 + 4k + 1.\n\nWait a minute, let's look at this expression: 4k\u00b2 + 4k + 1. I can factor out a 4 from the first two terms, which gives 4(k\u00b2 + k) + 1. So, n\u00b2 = 4(k\u00b2 + k) + 1. That means n\u00b2 is equal to 4 times some integer plus 1. \n\nBut 4 times any integer is obviously even because it's a multiple of 2. Adding 1 to an even number makes it odd. Therefore, n\u00b2 is equal to an even number plus 1, which is odd. \n\nBut here's the contradiction: we started by assuming that n\u00b2 is even. However, our calculation shows that n\u00b2 must be odd if n is odd. This is a contradiction because we can't have n\u00b2 being both even and odd at the same time. \n\nTherefore, our initial assumption that n is odd must be false. So, if n is an integer and n\u00b2 is even, then n must be even. That proves the statement using proof by contradiction.\n\nI think that makes sense. Let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So, we assumed n is odd, wrote it as 2k + 1, squared it, and found that n\u00b2 is 4(k\u00b2 + k) + 1, which is odd. But since n\u00b2 is given as even, this leads to a contradiction. So, n can't be odd, meaning it must be even. Yeah, that seems solid.\nDONE.\n</think>\n\nAlright, let's break this down step by step using proof by contradiction.\n\n**Step 1: Assume the opposite of the statement.**\nWe want to prove that if \\( n \\) is an integer and \\( n^2 \\) is even, then \\( n \\) is even.

The statement is: \"If n is an integer and n\u00b2 is even, then n is even.\" Hmm, okay, let me try to wrap my head around this.\n\nFirst, I remember that proof by contradiction is a method where you assume the opposite of what you want to prove and then show that this assumption leads to a contradiction. So, in this case, I need to assume that n is an integer, n\u00b2 is even, but n is not even. If I can show that this leads to a contradiction, then the original statement must be true.\n\nLet me start by formally setting up the problem. Let n be an integer such that n\u00b2 is even. I need to prove that n is even. So, let's assume the opposite: suppose n is odd. If n is odd, then n can be written as 2k + 1 for some integer k. That makes sense because any odd integer can be expressed in that form.\n\nNow, if n is 2k + 1, then n\u00b2 would be (2k + 1)\u00b2. Let me expand that. (2k + 1)\u00b2 equals 4k\u00b2 + 4k + 1. Hmm, okay, so n\u00b2 is 4k\u00b2 + 4k + 1. Now, I need to analyze whether this is even or odd.\n\nLooking at 4k\u00b2 and 4k, both of these terms are multiples of 4, right? So, they are definitely even because 4 is an even number. Adding two even numbers together gives another even number, so 4k\u00b2 + 4k is even. Then, adding 1 to an even number results in an odd number. So, n\u00b2 is odd.\n\nWait a minute, that's a problem. The original statement says that if n\u00b2 is even, then n must be even. But in this case, we assumed n is odd, and that led us to n\u00b2 being odd. That's a contradiction because we were given that n\u00b2 is even. So, our assumption that n is odd must be false. Therefore, n has to be even.\n\nLet me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. We started by assuming n is odd, expressed it as 2k + 1, squared it to get 4k\u00b2 + 4k + 1, and saw that it simplifies to an odd number. But since we were given that n\u00b2 is even, this assumption leads to a contradiction. Therefore, n cannot be odd, so it must be even.\n\nIs there any other angle I should consider? Maybe checking with specific numbers to verify. Let's take n = 3, which is odd. Then n\u00b2 = 9, which is odd. If n = 2, which is even, then n\u00b2 = 4, which is even. So, it seems consistent. If n is odd, n\u00b2 is odd; if n is even, n\u00b2 is even. That aligns with what we proved.\n\nI think that covers it. The proof by contradiction shows that assuming n is odd leads to n\u00b2 being odd, contradicting the given that n\u00b2 is even. Hence, n must be even.\n</think>\n\nAlright, so after carefully considering the problem and walking through the logic step by step, here's the step-by-step explanation:\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Assumption for Contradiction:** Let n be an integer such that n\u00b2 is even. We will assume the opposite of what we want to prove, which is that n is odd.\n\n2. **Expressing n as an Odd Integer:** If n is odd, it can be written in the form n = 2k + 1, where k is an integer.\n\n3. **Calculating n\u00b2:** Substitute n into the expression for n\u00b2:\n   \\[\n   n\u00b2 = (2k + 1)\u00b2 = 4k\u00b2 + 4k + 1\n   \\]\n\n4. **Analyzing Parity of n\u00b2:** \n   - The terms 4k\u00b2 and 4k are both multiples of 4, which are even numbers.\n   - Adding two even numbers: 4k\u00b2 + 4k is even.\n   - Adding 1 (an odd number) to an even number: 4k\u00b2 + 4k + 1 is odd.\n\n5. **Contradiction:** We were given that n\u00b2 is even, but our assumption leads to n\u00b2 being odd. This contradiction implies that our initial assumption (that n is odd) is false.\n\n6. **Conclusion:** Therefore, n must be even.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nDONE."

Hmm, okay. The problem suggests using proof by contradiction, which means I'll assume the opposite of what I want to prove and then show that this assumption leads to a contradiction. That makes sense because if the opposite leads to something impossible, then the original statement must be true.\n\nFirst, let me restate the problem in my own words. We have an integer n, and we know that when we square it, the result is even. I need to show that n itself must be even. So, if n squared is even, n has to be even. If I can show that assuming the opposite (that n is odd) leads to a contradiction, then I've proven the statement.\n\nOkay, let's get started. I'll begin by assuming the opposite of what I want to prove. That is, I'll assume that n is odd. If I can show that this leads to a contradiction, then my original statement must be true.\n\nSo, let's say n is odd. By definition, an odd integer can be written in the form 2k + 1, where k is an integer. That's the standard way to express odd numbers, right? So, n = 2k + 1.\n\nNow, let's compute n squared. If n is 2k + 1, then n squared would be (2k + 1)^2. Let me expand that. (2k + 1)^2 = 4k\u00b2 + 4k + 1. Hmm, okay. So, n squared is 4k\u00b2 + 4k + 1.\n\nWait a minute, the problem states that n squared is even. So, according to the problem, n\u00b2 is even, which means it's divisible by 2. Let's write that down: n\u00b2 is even \u21d2 n\u00b2 = 2m, where m is some integer.\n\nBut from our earlier expansion, n squared is 4k\u00b2 + 4k + 1. So, setting these equal, we have 4k\u00b2 + 4k + 1 = 2m. Hmm, now I have an equation: 4k\u00b2 + 4k + 1 = 2m.\n\nLet me try to simplify this equation. I can factor out a 4 from the first two terms on the left side: 4(k\u00b2 + k) + 1 = 2m. So, 4(k\u00b2 + k) is clearly divisible by 4, and then there's a +1 at the end.\n\nSo, let's see. 4(k\u00b2 + k) is divisible by 4, which means it's an even number because any multiple of 4 is even. Then we add 1 to it. So, 4(k\u00b2 + k) + 1 is an even number plus 1, which makes it odd. Therefore, the left side of the equation, 4(k\u00b2 + k) + 1, is odd.\n\nBut the right side of the equation is 2m, which is even because it's 2 multiplied by some integer m. So, we have an odd number equal to an even number. That's a contradiction because an odd number can't be equal to an even number.\n\nWait, so if my assumption that n is odd leads to a contradiction (an odd equals an even), then my assumption must be wrong. Therefore, n cannot be odd. So, n must be even.\n\nLet me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. I started by assuming n is odd, expressed it as 2k + 1, squared it to get 4k\u00b2 + 4k + 1, set that equal to 2m because n squared is even, and then simplified to show that 4(k\u00b2 + k) + 1 is odd. But 2m is even, so that's a contradiction. Therefore, n can't be odd, so it must be even.\n\nI think that covers it. I can't see any errors in this reasoning. The key was to express n as an odd number and then square it, which showed that n squared would have to be odd, contradicting the given that it's even. Hence, n must be even.\n</think>\n\nTo prove that if \\( n \\) is an integer and \\( n^2 \\) is even, then \\( n \\) is even, we use proof by contradiction.\n\n**Proof:**\n\n1. **Assume the opposite:** Suppose \\( n \\) is odd.

And I have to use proof by contradiction for this. Okay, let's start by understanding what this means.\n\nFirst, I know that an integer can be either even or odd. An even integer is divisible by 2 without any remainder, like 2, 4, 6, etc. An odd integer, on the other hand, leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 2, like 1, 3, 5, etc. So, n can be either even or odd.\n\nThe statement says that if n squared is even, then n must be even. Hmm, so I need to show that n can't be odd if n squared is even. How do I approach this? Well, proof by contradiction is a method where I assume the opposite of what I want to prove and then show that this assumption leads to a contradiction.\n\nSo, let me assume the opposite: suppose that n is odd. If n is odd, then n can be written as 2k + 1, where k is some integer. That's the standard way to express an odd number. Okay, so n = 2k + 1.\n\nNow, let's compute n squared. If n is 2k + 1, then n squared is (2k + 1) squared. Let me expand that: (2k + 1)(2k + 1). Multiplying this out, I get 4k\u00b2 + 4k + 1. So, n squared equals 4k\u00b2 + 4k + 1.\n\nWait, the problem says that n squared is even. So, if n squared is even, then 4k\u00b2 + 4k + 1 must be even. Let me think about that. 4k\u00b2 is definitely even because 4 times any integer is even. Similarly, 4k is also even. So, adding two even numbers: 4k\u00b2 + 4k is even. Then, we have +1 at the end. So, even + odd is odd. Therefore, n squared is odd.\n\nBut hold on, the problem states that n squared is even. So, if n is odd, n squared is odd, which contradicts the given that n squared is even. Therefore, my assumption that n is odd must be wrong. So, n cannot be odd; it must be even.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes here. I assumed n is odd, expressed it as 2k + 1, squared it, and found that it results in an odd number. But the problem says n squared is even, so that's a contradiction. Therefore, n can't be odd, so it must be even. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nIs there another way to think about this? Maybe using parity. Parity refers to whether a number is even or odd. If n is even, then n squared is even because even times even is even. If n is odd, then n squared is odd because odd times odd is odd. So, the only way for n squared to be even is if n is even. That's another way to see it.\n\nBut since the problem specifically asks for proof by contradiction, I should stick to that method. So, by assuming n is odd, I derived a contradiction with the given that n squared is even. Therefore, n must be even.\n\nI think I've covered all the bases here. I started by assuming the opposite, showed that it leads to a contradiction, and thus concluded that the original statement must be true. It all seems to fit together logically. I don't see any gaps or errors in my reasoning. So, I'm confident that this proof works.\n</think>\n\nAlright, let's break this down step by step using proof by contradiction.\n\n**Step 1: Assume the opposite of the statement we want to prove.**\nWe want to prove that if \\( n \\) is an integer and \\( n^2 \\) is even, then \\( n \\) is even.
