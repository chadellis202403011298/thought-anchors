  "question": "Look at the following sequence of shapes: \u25cb \u25b3 \u25a1 \u25cb \u25b3 \u25a1 \u25cb \u25b3 ? \nWhat shape should replace the question mark to continue the pattern?",
  "answer": "The correct shape is \u25a1 (square).\n\nStep 1: Analyze the given sequence: \u25cb \u25b3 \u25a1 \u25cb \u25b3 \u25a1 \u25cb \u25b3 ?\n\nStep 2: Look for repeating units in the sequence. We can see that the shapes follow a pattern of \u25cb (circle), then \u25b3 (triangle), then \u25a1 (square).\n\nStep 3: The pattern repeats as: \u25cb \u25b3 \u25a1 | \u25cb \u25b3 \u25a1 | \u25cb \u25b3 ?\n\nStep 4: Breaking it into groups of three, we see the pattern has completed two full cycles and has started a third cycle with \u25cb \u25b3.\n\nStep 5: Following the established pattern, after \u25b3 (triangle) comes \u25a1 (square) to complete the third cycle.\n\nTherefore, the shape that should replace the question mark is \u25a1 (square)."
