  "question": "In a school survey of 120 students, the following information was collected: 72 students like mathematics, 65 students like science, and 40 students like both mathematics and science. Based on this information, how many students like neither mathematics nor science?",
  "answer": "To solve this problem using Venn diagrams, I'll follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Identify what each value represents.\n- Total number of students: 120\n- Students who like mathematics: 72\n- Students who like science: 65\n- Students who like both mathematics and science: 40\n\nStep 2: Find the number of students who like mathematics only.\nStudents who like mathematics only = Students who like mathematics - Students who like both\n= 72 - 40 = 32 students\n\nStep 3: Find the number of students who like science only.\nStudents who like science only = Students who like science - Students who like both\n= 65 - 40 = 25 students\n\nStep 4: Find the number of students who like neither subject.\nStudents who like neither = Total students - (Mathematics only + Science only + Both)\n= 120 - (32 + 25 + 40)\n= 120 - 97\n= 23 students\n\nTherefore, 23 students like neither mathematics nor science."
