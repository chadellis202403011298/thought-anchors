End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: In a school survey of 120 students, the following information was collected: 72 students like mathematics, 65 students like science, and 40 students like both mathematics and science. Based on this information, how many students like neither mathematics nor science? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this problem here about a school survey where they asked 120 students about their preferences. Specifically, they asked if they like mathematics, science, both, or neither. The numbers they got were 72 students liking math, 65 liking science, and 40 liking both. The question is asking how many students like neither math nor science. Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, I remember something about sets and maybe using a Venn diagram to visualize this. So, if I imagine two overlapping circles, one representing math students and the other representing science students, the overlapping part would be the students who like both. The total number of students is 120, so that's the entire universe we're looking at.\n\nThey gave me the number of students who like math, which is 72, and those who like science, which is 65. But wait, 72 plus 65 is 137, which is more than the total number of students surveyed, which is 120. That doesn't make sense because you can't have more students liking math and science combined than the total number of students. So, that tells me there's an overlap, which is the 40 students who like both. That makes sense because if 40 students are counted in both the math and science circles, then the actual unique students in math would be 72 minus 40, and similarly for science.\n\nSo, let me write this down. The number of students who like only math would be 72 minus the 40 who like both. That gives me 32 students who like only math. Similarly, for science, it's 65 minus 40, which is 25 students who like only science. So now, if I add up the students who like only math, only science, and both, that should give me the total number of students who like at least one of the subjects. Let me calculate that: 32 (only math) + 25 (only science) + 40 (both) equals 97 students.\n\nBut the total number of students surveyed is 120, so if 97 students like either math or science or both, then the number of students who like neither must be the remaining students. So, I subtract 97 from 120, which gives me 23. Therefore, 23 students like neither mathematics nor science.\n\nWait, let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make a mistake. If I add up the students who like only math (32), only science (25), and both (40), that's 32 + 25 = 57, plus 40 is 97. Then, 120 minus 97 is indeed 23. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nAnother way to think about it is using the principle of inclusion-exclusion. The formula for the number of students who like either math or science or both is equal to the number who like math plus the number who like science minus the number who like both. So, that's 72 + 65 - 40, which is 97. Then, subtract that from the total number of students, 120, to get 23. Yep, that matches my previous calculation.\n\nSo, I'm pretty confident that the number of students who like neither subject is 23. I don't think I made any mistakes here because both methods gave me the same answer, and the numbers add up correctly.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many students like neither mathematics nor science, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\n\n1. **Total students surveyed:** 120\n2. **Students who like mathematics (M):** 72\n3. **Students who like science (S):** 65\n4. **Students who like both mathematics and science (M \u2229 S):** 40\n\nUsing the inclusion-exclusion principle:\n- Number of students who like either M or S or both = M + S - (M \u2229 S)\n- Number of students who like either M or S or both = 72 + 65 - 40 = 97\n\nTherefore, the number of students who like neither M nor S is:\n- Total students - Students who like either M or S or both = 120 - 97 = 23\n\n**Answer:** 23 students like neither mathematics nor science.\n\nDONE."
