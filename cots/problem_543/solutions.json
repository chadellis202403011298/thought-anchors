Hmm, okay, let's see. I remember this formula from arithmetic series, right? It's supposed to be a quick way to find the sum without adding each number one by one. But how exactly does that work?\n\nLet me start by writing out the sum: 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n. I need to find a way to express this sum in a different form that I can work with. Maybe there's a pattern or a symmetry here. I think I've heard something about pairing terms or something like that.\n\nOkay, so if I write the sum forwards and then backwards and add them together, maybe that will help. Let me try that. So, writing it forwards: 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n. Writing it backwards: n + (n-1) + (n-2) + ... + 1. Now, if I add these two sums together, term by term, what do I get?\n\nLet's see: the first term of the first sum is 1, and the first term of the second sum is n. So, adding them gives 1 + n. The second term of the first sum is 2, and the second term of the second sum is (n-1), so 2 + (n-1) is n + 1. Wait a minute, that's the same as the first pair. So, each pair adds up to n + 1.\n\nHow many such pairs are there? Well, there are n terms in total, so when I pair them like this, I'll have n/2 pairs. But wait, what if n is even or odd? Hmm, if n is even, then n/2 is an integer, but if n is odd, then the middle term is n/2, which would be a single term. Hmm, maybe I need to adjust for that.\n\nLet me think. If n is even, say n = 4, then the pairs are (1,4), (2,3). Each pair sums to 5, and there are 2 pairs, so total sum is 2 * 5 = 10, which is indeed 4*5/2. If n is odd, say n = 5, then the pairs are (1,5), (2,4), and the middle term is 3. Each pair sums to 6, so 2 pairs give 12, plus 3 gives 15, which is 5*6/2 = 15. Okay, so that works whether n is even or odd.\n\nSo, in general, when I add the sum forwards and backwards, I get n/2 pairs each summing to (n + 1). Therefore, the total sum is (n/2) * (n + 1). Which is the same as n(n + 1)/2. That makes sense!\n\nWait, but I should make sure that this works for all natural numbers, not just the ones I tried. Let me test it with n = 1. Then the sum is just 1. Plugging into the formula: 1*(1+1)/2 = 2/2 = 1. Correct. For n = 2: 1 + 2 = 3. Formula: 2*3/2 = 3. Correct. n = 3: 1 + 2 + 3 = 6. Formula: 3*4/2 = 6. Correct. n = 10: Sum is 55. Formula: 10*11/2 = 55. Correct.\n\nOkay, so this seems to hold for various values. Therefore, the identity is proven by this pairing method. I think that's a solid proof because it shows the general case by looking at both even and odd n, and it also checks out with specific examples.\n</think>\n\nTo prove that for all natural numbers \\( n \\geq 1 \\), the sum \\( 1 + 2 + 3 + \\dots + n \\) equals \\( \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} \\), consider the following:\n\n1. **Write the sum forwards and backwards:**\n   \\[\n   S = 1 + 2 + 3 + \\dots + n\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   S = n + (n-1) + (n-2) + \\dots + 1\n   \\]\n\n2. **Add the two equations term by term:**\n   \\[\n   S + S = (1 + n) + (2 + (n-1)) + (3 + (n-2)) + \\dots + (n + 1)\n   \\]\n   Each pair sums to \\( n + 1 \\).\n\n3. **Count the number of pairs:**\n   - If \\( n \\) is even, there are \\( \\frac{n}{2} \\) pairs.\n   - If \\( n \\) is odd, there are \\( \\frac{n - 1}{2} \\) pairs plus the middle term \\( \\frac{n + 1}{2} \\).\n\n4. **Calculate the total sum:**\n   \\[\n   2S = \\frac{n}{2} \\times (n + 1) \\quad \\text{(for even } n\\text{)}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   2S = \\left( \\frac{n - 1}{2} \\times (n + 1) \\right) + \\frac{n + 1}{2} \\quad \\text{(for odd } n\\text{)}\n   \\]\n   Simplifying both cases leads to:\n   \\[\n   S = \\frac{n(n + 1)}{2}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Verification with examples:**\n   - For \\( n = 1 \\): \\( 1 = \\frac{1 \\times 2}{2} = 1 \\)\n   - For \\( n = 2 \\): \\( 1 + 2 = 3 = \\frac{2 \\times 3}{2} = 3 \\)\n   - For \\( n = 3 \\): \\( 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 = \\frac{3 \\times 4}{2} = 6 \\)\n   - For \\( n = 10 \\): Sum is 55, and \\( \\frac{10 \\times 11}{2} = 55 \\)\n\nThus, the identity holds for all natural numbers \\( n \\geq 1 \\).\n\n**DONE.**"

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember something about Gauss's trick where you pair terms from both ends of the sequence. But I'm not entirely sure how that works, so I'll try to figure it out step by step.\n\nFirst, let me write down the sum we're trying to find: 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n. I need to show that this sum equals n(n+1)/2. Maybe I can try adding the terms in a different way. I've heard of Gauss adding and subtracting terms to find a pattern. Let me try that.\n\nSo, if I write the sum forwards and then backwards and add them together, maybe something cancels out. Let's see:\n\nForward: 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + (n-1) + n\nBackward: n + (n-1) + (n-2) + ... + 2 + 1\n\nNow, if I add these two sums together, term by term, what happens?\n\n1 + n, 2 + (n-1), 3 + (n-2), ..., (n-1) + 2, n + 1\n\nEach pair adds up to (n + 1). Let me count how many such pairs there are. Since there are n terms in the original sum, when I write them forwards and backwards, I have 2n terms. So, the number of pairs should be n.\n\nTherefore, the total sum when I add them together is n*(n + 1). But wait, that's actually twice the original sum because I added the forward and backward sums. So, if I let S be the original sum, then:\n\n2S = n*(n + 1)\n\nTherefore, solving for S gives:\n\nS = n*(n + 1)/2\n\nWhich is what I wanted to prove! So, that works out. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me test it with a small value of n, say n=3.\n\nCalculating the sum: 1 + 2 + 3 = 6\nUsing the formula: 3*(3+1)/2 = 12/2 = 6\nThey match. Let me try another one, n=5.\n\nSum: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15\nFormula: 5*6/2 = 15\nYep, that works too. Okay, so it seems like the pairing method works. I think that's a solid proof. I don't see any errors in my reasoning, and the examples check out. So, I'm confident this identity holds for all natural numbers n \u2265 1.\nDONE.\n</think>\n\nTo prove that for all natural numbers \\( n \\geq 1 \\), the sum \\( 1 + 2 + 3 + \\dots + n \\) equals \\( \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} \\), we can use the method of pairing terms.\n\n1.

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember something about Gauss's trick where you pair numbers from the start and end of the sequence. Let me try to recall how that works.\n\nAlright, so if I have the numbers 1, 2, 3, ..., n, and I write them down in two different ways. One forwards and one backwards. So, if I write them in a column like this:\n\n1  \n2  \n3  \n...  \nn  \n\nAnd then another column:\n\nn  \nn-1  \nn-2  \n...  \n1  \n\nNow, if I add these two columns together, what happens? Let me see:\n\n1 + n  \n2 + (n-1)  \n3 + (n-2)  \n...  \nn + 1  \n\nEach of these pairs adds up to n + 1. How many such pairs are there? Well, since there are n numbers, there are n pairs. So, the total sum would be n times (n + 1), which is n(n + 1).\n\nWait a second, but the original sum is just 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n. So, if I have two different expressions for the same sum, they should be equal. That means:\n\n1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n = n(n + 1)/2\n\nOh, but wait, I just got n(n + 1) from the pairing method. How does that relate to the original sum? Let me check my steps again.\n\nWhen I added the two columns, each pair is indeed n + 1, and there are n pairs. So, n(n + 1) should be twice the original sum. That makes sense because the original sum is only half of that. So, to get the original sum, I should divide by 2. Therefore:\n\n1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n = n(n + 1)/2\n\nYes, that seems correct. Let me test this with a small value of n to make sure. Let's take n = 3.\n\n1 + 2 + 3 = 6. On the other hand, 3(3 + 1)/2 = 12/2 = 6. Okay, that works. What about n = 5?\n\n1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15. And 5(5 + 1)/2 = 30/2 = 15. Perfect, it holds for these cases.\n\nSo, the pairing method works because when you sum the sequence forwards and backwards, you essentially create twice the original sum, allowing you to solve for it. This seems like a solid proof.\n</think>\n\nAlright, let's break this down step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Write the sum forwards and backwards.**\n\nConsider the sequence of natural numbers from 1 to n:\n\n1, 2, 3, ..., n\n\nNow, write the same sequence in reverse order:\n\nn, n-1, n-2, ..., 1\n\n**Step 2: Add the two sequences column by column.**\n\nWhen you add each pair of numbers from the two sequences, you get:\n\n1 + n,  \n2 + (n-1),  \n3 + (n-2),  \n...  \nn + 1\n\nEach of these pairs adds up to n + 1.\n\n**Step 3: Count the number of pairs.**\n\nThere are n numbers in each sequence, so there are n pairs when added together.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the total sum from the pairs.**\n\nEach pair sums to n + 1, and there are n pairs:\n\nTotal sum = n * (n + 1)\n\n**Step 5: Relate this total to the original sum.**\n\nNotice that the original sum (1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n) is exactly half of the total sum obtained from the pairs because each number in the original sum is counted twice in the total.\n\nTherefore:\n\n1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n = (n * (n + 1)) / 2\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe sum of all natural numbers from 1 to n is equal to n(n + 1)/2.\n\nDONE."

But I'm not entirely sure how it works, so I'll try to figure it out step by step.\n\nFirst, let me write down what I know. The sum of the first n natural numbers is 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n. I need to show that this sum is equal to n(n+1)/2. So, I need to find a way to relate the sum to a product or some other expression that can be simplified to n(n+1)/2.\n\nOne method I recall is to write the sum forwards and backwards and then add them together. Let me try that. So, if I write the sum S = 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n, then writing it backwards would be n + (n-1) + (n-2) + ... + 1. Now, if I add these two equations together, term by term, what happens?\n\nLet's see:\n\nS = 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n\nS' = n + (n-1) + (n-2) + ... + 1\n\nAdding S and S' term by term:\n\nS + S' = (1 + n) + (2 + (n-1)) + (3 + (n-2)) + ... + ((n-1) + 2) + (n + 1)\n\nWait, that seems a bit messy. Let me see if I can pair the terms differently. If I add S and S', each pair should add up to n + 1. Let me check:\n\n1 + n = n + 1\n2 + (n-1) = n + 1\n3 + (n-2) = n + 1\n...\nContinuing this pattern, each pair adds up to n + 1.\n\nNow, how many such pairs are there? Since there are n terms in the original sum, when we add them forwards and backwards, we end up with 2n terms, right? So, there are n pairs, each adding up to n + 1.\n\nTherefore, S + S' = n*(n + 1)\n\nBut wait, S is the original sum, which is 1 + 2 + ... + n, and S' is the same sum written backwards. So, S = S', which means S + S = 2S = n(n + 1). Therefore, 2S = n(n + 1), so S = n(n + 1)/2.\n\nOkay, that makes sense. But let me try to think of another way to approach this, maybe using mathematical induction. I remember that induction is a powerful tool for proving statements about natural numbers.\n\nSo, for induction, I need to prove two things: the base case and the inductive step.\n\nBase case: n = 1. The sum is just 1, and the formula gives 1*(1+1)/2 = 2/2 = 1. So, the base case holds.\n\nInductive step: Assume that the formula holds for some arbitrary natural number k, i.e., 1 + 2 + ... + k = k(k+1)/2. Now, I need to show that it also holds for k + 1, i.e., 1 + 2 + ... + k + (k+1) = (k+1)(k+2)/2.\n\nStarting with the left side: 1 + 2 + ... + k + (k+1). By the induction hypothesis, the sum up to k is k(k+1)/2, so adding (k+1) gives us k(k+1)/2 + (k+1).\n\nFactor out (k+1): (k+1)(k/2 + 1) = (k+1)(k + 2)/2.\n\nWhich is exactly the formula for k + 1. Therefore, by induction, the formula holds for all natural numbers n \u2265 1.\n\nHmm, that seems solid. But I wonder if there's another way to visualize this, maybe using geometry or some sort of diagram. I think I've heard of a method where you arrange objects in a certain way to see the sum.\n\nLet me try to imagine arranging objects in a triangle. For example, if I have one row with one object, that's 1. If I add another row with two objects, the total is 1 + 2 = 3. Another row with three objects, total becomes 6, and so on. Each new row adds as many objects as the row number.\n\nWait, but how does this help in proving the formula? Maybe by considering the total number of objects in each row and then summing them up. But I'm not sure if this approach leads directly to the formula. It might be more useful for understanding the concept rather than proving it.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about the sum in terms of averages. The average of the first n natural numbers is (1 + n)/2, and there are n terms. So, the sum should be average times the number of terms, which is (1 + n)/2 * n = n(n + 1)/2. That seems straightforward, but I wonder if that's considered a formal proof or more of an intuitive explanation.\n\nAnother approach might be to use algebraic manipulation. Let's consider S = 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n. If I multiply both sides by (n + 1), what happens? S(n + 1) = (1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n)(n + 1). Expanding the right side, it would be 1*n + 1*1 + 2*n + 2*1 + 3*n + 3*1 + ... + n*n + n*1. Wait, that seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way to expand it.\n\nAlternatively, I could write S(n + 1) = n(n + 1) + S. Wait, let me check that. If I consider the sum S = 1 + 2 + ... + n, then S(n + 1) would be the sum of the first n + 1 numbers, which is S + (n + 1). But that's not quite right because S(n + 1) = S + (n + 1). So, S(n + 1) = S + (n + 1). But I also have S(n + 1) = (n + 1)(n + 2)/2 from the formula. So, setting these equal: S + (n + 1) = (n + 1)(n + 2)/2. Therefore, S = (n + 1)(n + 2)/2 - (n + 1) = (n + 1)(n + 2 - 2)/2 = (n + 1)n/2. So, that works. But I'm not sure if this is a standard method or if it's just a clever trick.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake there. Let me check again. If S = 1 + 2 + ... + n, then S(n + 1) would actually be the sum up to n + 1, which is S + (n + 1). But that's not the same as multiplying S by (n + 1). Oh, I see, I confused two different methods. So, that approach might not be the best.\n\nPerhaps another way is to consider the sum S = 1 + 2 + ... + n and subtract the sum of the first (n - 1) numbers from it. So, S - (1 + 2 + ... + (n - 1)) = n. By the induction hypothesis, 1 + 2 + ... + (n - 1) = (n - 1)n/2. So, S - (n - 1)n/2 = n. Therefore, S = n + (n - 1)n/2. Let's factor out n: S = n(1 + (n - 1)/2) = n(2 + n - 1)/2 = n(n + 1)/2. That works too, but again, I'm not sure if this is the most straightforward method.\n\nI think the pairing method is the most straightforward and intuitive. It's simple and doesn't require advanced concepts. The induction method is also solid, but it might be a bit more involved for someone just starting out. The average method is quick but might not feel like a formal proof to some.\n\nWait, let me go back to the pairing method. So, S = 1 + 2 + ... + n, and S' = n + (n - 1) + ... + 1. Adding them together gives 2S = (n + 1) + (n + 1) + ... + (n + 1), with n terms of (n + 1). So, 2S = n(n + 1), hence S = n(n + 1)/2. That seems correct.\n\nAnother thought: maybe using summation notation. The sum from k = 1 to n of k is equal to the sum from k = 1 to n of k. But that's just restating the problem. Alternatively, using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. Since the numbers 1, 2, ..., n form an arithmetic series with first term a = 1, common difference d = 1, and number of terms n. The sum of an arithmetic series is given by S = n/2 * (2a + (n - 1)d). Plugging in, S = n/2 * (2*1 + (n - 1)*1) = n/2 * (2 + n - 1) = n/2 * (n + 1) = n(n + 1)/2. That's another way to derive it using known formulas.\n\nBut I think the pairing method is the most elegant because it doesn't require prior knowledge of arithmetic series or induction. It's a simple and clever trick that anyone can grasp.\n\nWait, let me try to visualize the pairing again. If I write the sum forwards and backwards, and then add them, each pair adds up to n + 1, and there are n such pairs, so the total is n(n + 1). Since the original sum S is equal to the reversed sum S', adding them gives 2S = n(n + 1), so S = n(n + 1)/2. That makes sense.\n\nI think I've covered multiple methods: pairing, induction, average, and arithmetic series formula. Each one confirms the identity. So, regardless of the approach, the result holds true. It's reassuring to see that different methods lead to the same conclusion, reinforcing the validity of the proof.\n\nIn conclusion, whether using the pairing method, induction, or known summation formulas, the identity 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n = n(n + 1)/2 holds for all natural numbers n \u2265 1.\n</think>\n\nThe identity states that the sum of the first n natural numbers equals n(n + 1)/2. To prove this, we can use the pairing method:\n\n1. Write the sum forwards: S = 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n.\n2. Write the sum backwards: S' = n + (n - 1) + (n - 2) + ... + 1.\n3. Add S and S' term by term:\n   - 1 + n = n + 1\n   - 2 + (n - 1) = n + 1\n   - Continue this pattern until all terms are paired.\n4. Each pair sums to (n + 1), and there are n such pairs.\n5. Therefore, S + S' = n(n + 1).\n6. Since S = S', this gives 2S = n(n + 1).\n7. Solving for S, we get S = n(n + 1)/2.\n\nHence, the identity is proven.\n\nDONE."

Hmm, okay. I remember hearing about this formula before, it's called the arithmetic series sum or something like that. But I need to actually prove it, not just state it. \n\nLet me start by writing down what I know. The sum of the first n natural numbers is S = 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n. I need to show that S = n(n+1)/2. How can I approach this? Maybe I can use mathematical induction since it's a statement for all natural numbers. That seems like a solid method for proving identities like this.\n\nOkay, so induction requires two steps: the base case and the inductive step. Let me handle the base case first. When n = 1, the sum S should be 1. Plugging into the formula, n(n+1)/2 = 1*(1+1)/2 = 2/2 = 1. That matches, so the base case holds.\n\nNow, for the inductive step. I need to assume that the formula holds for some arbitrary natural number k, meaning that 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + k = k(k+1)/2. Then, I have to show that it also holds for k + 1, that is, 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + k + (k+1) equals (k+1)(k+2)/2.\n\nStarting with the left side for k + 1: S = 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + k + (k+1). According to the inductive hypothesis, the sum up to k is k(k+1)/2, so S = k(k+1)/2 + (k+1). I can factor out (k+1): S = (k+1)(k/2 + 1). Let me compute that: (k+1)(k + 2)/2, because k/2 + 1 is the same as (k + 2)/2. So that gives S = (k+1)(k+2)/2, which is exactly the formula for n = k + 1. Therefore, by induction, the formula holds for all natural numbers n \u2265 1.\n\nWait, did I do that right? Let me check my steps. I started with S = sum up to k + (k+1). Substituted the inductive hypothesis correctly. Factored out (k+1), combined the terms, and simplified to get the desired formula. Yep, that seems correct. I think I've successfully proven it using mathematical induction.\n\nAlternatively, I remember another method called the \"pairing\" method. Maybe I can try that too to reinforce my understanding. So, if I write the sum forwards and backwards and add them together:\n\n1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n\nand\nn + (n-1) + (n-2) + ... + 1\n\nAdding these two equations:\n\n(1 + n) + (2 + (n-1)) + (3 + (n-2)) + ... + ((n-1) + 2) + (n + 1)\n\nEach pair adds up to n + 1. How many such pairs are there? There are n pairs because there are n terms in each sum. So, the total sum is n*(n + 1). But wait, that's twice the original sum because I added S to itself. So, 2S = n(n + 1), which means S = n(n + 1)/2. That's another way to see it without induction. Cool, that makes sense.\n\nAnother way I've heard about is using the concept of average. The sum of numbers from 1 to n is the same as the average of the first and last term multiplied by the number of terms. The average of 1 and n is (1 + n)/2, and there are n terms. So, S = (1 + n)/2 * n = n(n + 1)/2. That's a neat approach too.\n\nWait, but I'm supposed to choose one method for the proof. Induction is more formal and perhaps expected here. But it's good to know multiple methods. Anyway, sticking with induction for this proof.\n\nIs there any other way? Maybe visualizing it with objects. Suppose you have a line of objects, like apples or books. If you line them up, the sum is S = 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n. If you arrange them in a different pattern, like a triangle, you can see how the sum builds up. Each row adds an extra number, and the total can be visualized as n(n + 1)/2. But I think the induction proof is the most straightforward.\n\nLet me just recap. For induction:\n\n1. Base case: n = 1, sum = 1, formula gives 1(1+1)/2 = 1. Correct.\n2. Inductive step: Assume sum up to k is k(k+1)/2. Then, sum up to k+1 is k(k+1)/2 + (k+1) = (k+1)(k + 2)/2. Correct.\n\nTherefore, by mathematical induction, the identity holds for all natural numbers n \u2265 1.\n\nI think I've covered all the necessary steps and verified each part. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. It all lines up logically, so I'm confident in the proof.\n</think>\n\nTo prove that for all natural numbers \\( n \\geq 1 \\), the identity \\( 1 + 2 + 3 + \\ldots + n = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} \\) holds, we can use mathematical induction.\n\n**Base Case:**  \nFor \\( n = 1 \\), the sum is \\( 1 \\).  \nThe formula gives \\( \\frac{1(1+1)}{2} = \\frac{2}{2} = 1 \\).  \nThus, the base case holds.\n\n**Inductive Step:**  \nAssume the formula holds for some arbitrary natural number \\( k \\), i.e.,  \n\\( 1 + 2 + 3 + \\ldots + k = \\frac{k(k+1)}{2} \\).\n\nWe need to show it holds for \\( k + 1 \\), i.e.,  \n\\( 1 + 2 + 3 + \\ldots + k + (k+1) = \\frac{(k+1)(k+2)}{2} \\).\n\nStarting with the left side:  \n\\( 1 + 2 + 3 + \\ldots + k + (k+1) = \\frac{k(k+1)}{2} + (k+1) \\).\n\nFactor out \\( (k+1) \\):  \n\\( = (k+1)\\left( \\frac{k}{2} + 1 \\right) \\).\n\nSimplify the expression inside the parentheses:  \n\\( = (k+1)\\left( \\frac{k + 2}{2} \\right) \\).\n\nThus,  \n\\( = \\frac{(k+1)(k+2)}{2} \\),  \nwhich matches the formula for \\( n = k + 1 \\).\n\nBy the principle of mathematical induction, the identity holds for all natural numbers \\( n \\geq 1 \\).\n\n**Final Answer:**  \nThe identity \\( 1 + 2 + 3 + \\ldots + n = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} \\) is proven for all natural numbers \\( n \\geq 1 \\).  \nDONE."

End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: Prove that for all natural numbers n \u2265 1, the following identity holds: 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n = n(n+1)/2. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem where I need to prove that the sum of the first n natural numbers is equal to n(n+1)/2. Hmm, I remember this formula from arithmetic series, but I need to actually prove it, not just state it. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, maybe I should write out the sum explicitly. So, 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n. I need to find a way to show that this sum equals n(n+1)/2. I've heard about mathematical induction before; maybe I can use that method. I think induction involves proving the base case and then showing that if it holds for some number, it holds for the next one.\n\nAlright, let's try that. The base case would be n = 1. So, plugging in, the sum is just 1. On the other side, 1(1+1)/2 is 2/2 which is 1. Okay, so the base case works.\n\nNow, let's assume that the formula holds for some arbitrary natural number k. That is, assume that 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + k = k(k+1)/2. This is my induction hypothesis.\n\nNext, I need to show that if the formula holds for k, it also holds for k+1. So, let's compute the sum up to k+1: 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + k + (k+1). According to the induction hypothesis, the sum up to k is k(k+1)/2, so adding (k+1) gives us k(k+1)/2 + (k+1).\n\nHmm, I can factor out (k+1) from both terms. So, that would be (k+1)(k/2 + 1). Let me simplify that. k/2 + 1 is the same as (k + 2)/2. So, multiplying (k+1) by (k + 2)/2 gives (k+1)(k+2)/2, which is the formula for n = k+1. Therefore, by induction, the formula holds for all natural numbers n \u2265 1.\n\nWait, did I do that correctly? Let me double-check. Starting with the sum up to k+1: 1 + 2 + ... + k + (k+1). The sum up to k is k(k+1)/2, so adding (k+1) gives k(k+1)/2 + (k+1). Factoring out (k+1) gives (k+1)(k/2 + 1). Then, k/2 + 1 is (k + 2)/2, so (k+1)(k+2)/2. Yep, that seems right. So, the inductive step holds.\n\nTherefore, by mathematical induction, the identity 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n = n(n+1)/2 is true for all natural numbers n \u2265 1.\n\nAlternatively, I think there's another way to visualize this, maybe using a figure or a diagram. I remember something about pairing terms or using a rectangle to represent the sum. Let me try to sketch that mentally.\n\nImagine a rectangle where one side has n items and the other side has n+1. If I fill the rectangle diagonally, starting from the top left to the bottom right, the number of objects would be the sum 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n. Wait, how does that relate to n(n+1)/2?\n\nActually, another method is to consider the average of the first and last term multiplied by the number of terms. The first term is 1, and the last term is n. The average of these is (1 + n)/2, and the number of terms is n. So, the sum would be n*(1 + n)/2, which is the same as n(n+1)/2. That makes sense too.\n\nI think I've covered the induction method and the pairing method. Both seem to confirm the identity. Maybe I can also think about it recursively. Let's see, the sum S(n) = S(n-1) + n. If I assume S(n-1) = (n-1)n/2, then S(n) = (n-1)n/2 + n = [n(n-1) + 2n]/2 = [n^2 - n + 2n]/2 = [n^2 + n]/2 = n(n+1)/2. Yep, that works too.\n\nSo, whether I use induction, pairing, or recursion, the identity holds. I think that's solid. I don't see any flaws in these reasoning steps. Maybe I should also test it with a small value to be extra sure. Let's take n=3. The sum is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6. Plugging into the formula: 3*4/2 = 12/2 = 6. Perfect, it matches. Another test: n=5. Sum is 15. Formula: 5*6/2=30/2=15. Correct again. Okay, I'm confident this proof is valid.\n</think>\n\nTo prove that for all natural numbers \\( n \\geq 1 \\), the identity \\( 1 + 2 + 3 + \\dots + n = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} \\) holds, we can use mathematical induction.\n\n**Base Case:**  \nFor \\( n = 1 \\), the left-hand side (LHS) is \\( 1 \\). The right-hand side (RHS) is \\( \\frac{1(1+1)}{2} = \\frac{2}{2} = 1 \\). Thus, the base case holds.\n\n**Inductive Step:**  \nAssume the formula holds for some arbitrary natural number \\( k \\), i.e.,  \n\\( 1 + 2 + 3 + \\dots + k = \\frac{k(k+1)}{2} \\).\n\nWe need to show it holds for \\( k + 1 \\).  \nConsider the sum up to \\( k + 1 \\):  \n\\( 1 + 2 + 3 + \\dots + k + (k+1) \\).  \nUsing the induction hypothesis:  \n\\( \\frac{k(k+1)}{2} + (k+1) \\).  \nFactor out \\( k + 1 \\):  \n\\( (k + 1)\\left(\\frac{k}{2} + 1\\right) = (k + 1)\\left(\\frac{k + 2}{2}\\right) = \\frac{(k + 1)(k + 2)}{2} \\).  \nThis matches the formula for \\( n = k + 1 \\).\n\nBy the principle of mathematical induction, the identity holds for all natural numbers \\( n \\geq 1 \\).\n\n**Final Answer:**  \nThe identity \\( 1 + 2 + 3 + \\dots + n = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} \\) is proven to hold for all natural numbers \\( n \\geq 1 \\).\n\nDONE."

Hmm, okay. Let's see. I remember in school, there was something called mathematical induction. Maybe I can use that. But I'm not entirely sure how that works. Let me try to recall.\n\nFirst, mathematical induction has two steps: the base case and the inductive step. The base case is where you prove the statement is true for the initial value, usually n=1. Then, the inductive step assumes it's true for some arbitrary natural number k, and then you prove it must also be true for k+1.\n\nOkay, let's start with the base case. If n=1, the sum is just 1. Plugging into the formula, n(n+1)/2 would be 1*(1+1)/2, which is 2/2, so 1. That matches, so the base case holds.\n\nNow, for the inductive step. Let's assume that the formula works for some arbitrary natural number k, meaning that 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + k = k(k+1)/2. That's our induction hypothesis.\n\nNow, I need to show that the formula also holds for k+1. So, the sum up to k+1 would be the sum up to k plus (k+1). That is, 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + k + (k+1). According to the induction hypothesis, this is equal to k(k+1)/2 + (k+1).\n\nLet me compute that: k(k+1)/2 + (k+1). I can factor out (k+1): (k+1)(k/2 + 1). Let's see, k/2 + 1 can be written as (k + 2)/2. So, the expression becomes (k+1)(k + 2)/2, which is exactly the formula for n = k+1. Therefore, by induction, the formula holds for all natural numbers n \u2265 1.\n\nWait, is there another way to think about this? Maybe using a visual method or another approach to confirm. I've heard of pairing terms or something like that. Let me try.\n\nIf I write the sum forwards and backwards:\n\n1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n\n\nand\n\nn + (n-1) + (n-2) + ... + 1\n\nIf I add these two equations together, term by term, I get:\n\n(1 + n) + (2 + (n-1)) + (3 + (n-2)) + ... + ((n/2) + (n/2)) if n is even, or similar if n is odd.\n\nEach pair adds up to (n + 1). How many such pairs are there? If n is even, there are n/2 pairs, each summing to (n + 1). So, the total sum would be (n/2)*(n + 1). If n is odd, there are (n-1)/2 pairs plus the middle term n/2, which is n. But wait, that might complicate things. Maybe I should stick with the induction proof since it worked smoothly.\n\nAlternatively, I remember something about Gauss's trick where you pair the first and last terms. Let me try that again. So, sum from 1 to n is (1 + n) + (2 + (n-1)) + ... + ((n/2) + (n/2)) if n is even. Each pair sums to n + 1, and there are n/2 such pairs, so total is (n/2)*(n + 1). Which is the same as n(n + 1)/2. If n is odd, the middle term is (n+1)/2, but when you add all the pairs, you still end up with n(n + 1)/2. So that method also works.\n\nI think the induction method is more straightforward for a proof, though. It systematically shows that if it works for k, it works for k+1, thus covering all natural numbers.\n\nAnother way I thought about it is using recursion. The sum S(n) = S(n-1) + n. If S(n-1) = (n-1)n/2, then S(n) = (n-1)n/2 + n = n(n-1 + 2)/2 = n(n + 1)/2. That also works, similar to induction.\n\nSo, all these methods seem to confirm the identity. I guess the induction proof is the most formal and generalizable, though. It's always good to have multiple approaches to verify the result, but for the proof itself, induction is sufficient and clear.\n</think>\n\nTo prove that for all natural numbers \\( n \\geq 1 \\), the identity \\( 1 + 2 + 3 + \\dots + n = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} \\) holds, we can use mathematical induction.\n\n**Base Case:**  \nFor \\( n = 1 \\),\n\\[\n1 = \\frac{1(1+1)}{2} = \\frac{2}{2} = 1\n\\]\nThe base case holds.\n\n**Inductive Step:**  \nAssume the statement is true for some arbitrary natural number \\( k \\), i.e.,\n\\[\n1 + 2 + 3 + \\dots + k = \\frac{k(k+1)}{2}\n\\]\nWe need to show that it then holds for \\( k + 1 \\).

Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that there are a few methods to prove this identity. One common way is using mathematical induction. Another might be through a geometric series or some kind of visual representation. Let me try induction first because I think it's straightforward and often used for such proofs.\n\nOkay, so mathematical induction involves two main steps: the base case and the inductive step. In the base case, I need to show that the formula holds for n = 1. Let's see, when n is 1, the sum is just 1. Plugging into the formula, we get 1(1+1)/2 = 2/2 = 1. So that works out. Base case is satisfied.\n\nNow, for the inductive step, I assume that the formula holds for some arbitrary natural number k. That is, I assume that 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + k = k(k+1)/2. This is my induction hypothesis. Then, I need to show that if this holds for k, it must also hold for k+1.\n\nSo, let's consider the sum up to k+1. That would be 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + k + (k+1). According to my induction hypothesis, the sum up to k is k(k+1)/2. So, adding (k+1) to both sides, I get k(k+1)/2 + (k+1).\n\nHmm, let me factor out (k+1) from both terms. So, that would be (k+1)(k/2 + 1). Simplifying inside the parentheses, k/2 + 1 is the same as (k + 2)/2. So, now the expression becomes (k+1)(k+2)/2. Which is exactly the formula for n = k+1. Therefore, by induction, the formula holds for all natural numbers n \u2265 1.\n\nWait, that seems too smooth. Let me double-check my steps. Starting from the inductive step: assuming 1+2+...+k = k(k+1)/2. Then, 1+2+...+k + (k+1) = k(k+1)/2 + (k+1). Factoring out (k+1), yes, that gives (k+1)(k/2 + 1). Then, combining the terms inside the parentheses: k/2 + 1 is (k + 2)/2. So, (k+1)(k+2)/2, which is indeed the formula for n = k+1. So, that checks out.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about this problem using a visual method, like arranging objects or using a figure. Sometimes, people use a staircase or dots to visualize the sum. For example, imagine you have n dots arranged in a line. If you form a staircase where each step has one more dot than the previous, the total number of dots would be the sum 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n.\n\nWait, actually, another way is to consider pairing terms. Like, the first term and the last term, the second term and the second last term, etc. Each pair adds up to (n+1). So, how many such pairs are there? Well, if n is even, there are n/2 pairs, each summing to (n+1), so the total sum would be (n/2)*(n+1). But if n is odd, there's a middle term which is (n+1)/2. So, the sum would be (n-1)/2*(n+1) + (n+1)/2. Wait, let me compute that.\n\nFor odd n: (n-1)/2*(n+1) + (n+1)/2. Let's factor out (n+1)/2: (n+1)/2*(n - 1 + 1) = (n+1)/2 * n = n(n+1)/2. So, same result. For even n, it's (n/2)*(n+1). But n/2 is the same as n(n+1)/2 when n is even? Wait, no. Wait, n(n+1)/2 when n is even would be (n/2)*(n+1), which is the same as the even case. So, regardless of whether n is odd or even, the formula holds. That's another way to see it.\n\nHmm, so both induction and pairing the terms give the same result. I think that solidifies the proof further.\n\nAnother approach is using the concept of arithmetic series. The sum of the first n natural numbers is an arithmetic series where each term increases by 1. The formula for the sum of an arithmetic series is (number of terms)/2 * (first term + last term). Here, the number of terms is n, the first term is 1, and the last term is n. So, the sum is n/2 * (1 + n) = n(n+1)/2. That's a direct application of the arithmetic series formula, which is another way to prove it.\n\nWait, but isn't that kind of what I did with the pairing method? Because in pairing, I was effectively pairing the first and last terms, which are 1 and n, and then counting how many such pairs there are, which is n/2 if even, and then dealing with the middle term if odd. So, in a way, it's similar to the arithmetic series approach.\n\nI think I've covered the main methods: induction, pairing, and arithmetic series. Each of them leads to the conclusion that 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n = n(n+1)/2 for all natural numbers n \u2265 1.\n\nJust to make sure, let me test this formula with a specific example. Let's take n=3. The sum is 1+2+3=6. Plugging into the formula, 3(3+1)/2 = 12/2 = 6. That works. Another example, n=5: 1+2+3+4+5=15. Formula: 5(5+1)/2 = 30/2=15. Perfect. How about n=10: sum is 55. Formula: 10(11)/2=110/2=55. Yep, it holds.\n\nI guess another thing to consider is why this formula is so fundamental. It's because it's the basis for calculating triangular numbers, which have various applications in mathematics and real-world problems, like dividing a cake fairly or calculating the number of handshakes in a group.\n\nIn summary, through mathematical induction, pairing terms, and applying the arithmetic series formula, I've confirmed that the identity holds for all natural numbers n \u2265 1.\n</think>\n\nTo prove that for all natural numbers \\( n \\geq 1 \\), the identity \\( 1 + 2 + 3 + \\dots + n = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} \\) holds, we can use mathematical induction.\n\n**Base Case:**  \nFor \\( n = 1 \\), the left-hand side (LHS) is \\( 1 \\).  \nThe right-hand side (RHS) is \\( \\frac{1(1+1)}{2} = 1 \\).  \nThus, LHS = RHS when \\( n = 1 \\).\n\n**Inductive Step:**  \nAssume the formula holds for some arbitrary natural number \\( k \\), i.e.,  \n\\( 1 + 2 + 3 + \\dots + k = \\frac{k(k+1)}{2} \\).\n\nWe need to show that the formula holds for \\( k + 1 \\), i.e.,  \n\\( 1 + 2 + 3 + \\dots + k + (k+1) = \\frac{(k+1)(k+2)}{2} \\).\n\nStarting with the LHS for \\( k + 1 \\):  \n\\( 1 + 2 + 3 + \\dots + k + (k+1) \\)  \nBy the induction hypothesis, this is \\( \\frac{k(k+1)}{2} + (k+1) \\).\n\nFactor out \\( (k+1) \\):  \n\\( (k+1) \\left( \\frac{k}{2} + 1 \\right) \\)  \nSimplify inside the parentheses:  \n\\( (k+1) \\left( \\frac{k + 2}{2} \\right) \\)  \nMultiply:  \n\\( \\frac{(k+1)(k+2)}{2} \\), which is the RHS for \\( n = k + 1 \\).\n\nBy the principle of mathematical induction, the identity holds for all natural numbers \\( n \\geq 1 \\).\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nFor all natural numbers \\( n \\geq 1 \\), \\( 1 + 2 + 3 + \\dots + n = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} \\).\n\nDONE."

End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: Prove that for all natural numbers n \u2265 1, the following identity holds: 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n = n(n+1)/2. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I need to prove that for every natural number n that's 1 or bigger, the sum of the numbers from 1 up to n is equal to n times (n plus 1) divided by 2. Hmm, okay, that sounds like a classic problem. I remember hearing about Gauss's trick or something like that when I was younger. Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, let's write down what the problem is asking. We have the sum S = 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n, and we need to show that this is equal to n(n+1)/2. So, S = n(n+1)/2. Got it.\n\nNow, I think the way to approach this is by using mathematical induction. Induction is a method where you prove a base case and then show that if it holds for one case, it holds for the next one, kind of like dominoes. That should work here.\n\nLet me start with the base case. When n = 1, the sum S is just 1. Plugging into the formula, we get 1*(1+1)/2 = 2/2 = 1. So, the base case checks out. That\u2019s straightforward.\n\nNext, assume that the formula holds for some arbitrary natural number k. That is, assume that 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + k = k(k+1)/2. This is our induction hypothesis. Now, we need to show that it holds for k + 1. So, let's compute the sum up to k + 1.\n\nThe sum S for k + 1 would be S = 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + k + (k + 1). According to our induction hypothesis, the sum up to k is k(k + 1)/2, so adding (k + 1) to both sides gives S = k(k + 1)/2 + (k + 1).\n\nHmm, okay, so let's factor out (k + 1) from both terms. That would give S = (k + 1)(k/2 + 1). Wait, let me do that step carefully. So, S = (k(k + 1))/2 + (k + 1). To factor, I can write this as S = (k + 1)(k/2 + 1). But to make it cleaner, maybe I should get a common denominator. So, k/2 + 1 is the same as (k + 2)/2. Therefore, S = (k + 1)(k + 2)/2. That's exactly the formula we want for n = k + 1. So, the formula holds for k + 1 if it holds for k.\n\nSince we've checked the base case and the inductive step, by mathematical induction, the formula holds for all natural numbers n \u2265 1. That seems to make sense. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, but let me think about it another way to double-check.\n\nAnother approach might be to visualize the sum. If I write the numbers in two rows, one forwards and one backwards, like this:\n\n1    2    3    4\n4    3    2    1\n\nAdding them together, each pair sums to 5 (1+4, 2+3, etc.). If there are n numbers, there are n/2 such pairs, each adding up to n + 1. So, the total sum would be (n/2)*(n + 1). Wait, that's the same as n(n + 1)/2. Yep, that works too. So, that's another way to see it.\n\nAlternatively, I could use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. Since the numbers from 1 to n form an arithmetic sequence with the first term a = 1, common difference d = 1, and number of terms n. The formula for the sum of an arithmetic series is S = n*(a + l)/2, where l is the last term. Here, the last term l is n. So, S = n*(1 + n)/2, which is n(n + 1)/2. That also matches.\n\nI think I've covered all the bases here. I've used induction, visualized it with pairs, and applied the arithmetic series formula. All methods lead to the same conclusion.

End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: Prove that for all natural numbers n \u2265 1, the following identity holds: 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n = n(n+1)/2. \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I need to prove that the sum of the first n natural numbers, which is 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n, equals n(n+1)/2. Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that there are a couple of methods to prove this. One is mathematical induction, and another might be a more algebraic approach. Maybe I can try both and see which one makes more sense.\n\nStarting with mathematical induction. I think that's a common method for proving statements that involve integers like this. So, induction usually involves two steps: the base case and the inductive step.\n\nBase case: Let me check if the formula holds when n=1. So, plugging in n=1, the left side is 1, and the right side is 1*(1+1)/2 = 2/2 = 1. Okay, that works. So the base case is satisfied.\n\nInductive step: Now, I need to assume that the formula holds for some arbitrary natural number k, meaning that 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + k = k(k+1)/2. Then, I need to show that it holds for k+1, that is, 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + k + (k+1) equals (k+1)(k+2)/2.\n\nStarting from the left side: 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + k + (k+1). But from the inductive hypothesis, I know that 1 + 2 + ... + k is k(k+1)/2. So, adding (k+1) to both sides, I get k(k+1)/2 + (k+1).\n\nNow, I can factor out (k+1): (k+1)(k/2 + 1). Let me compute that: (k+1)(k + 2)/2, because k/2 + 1 is (k + 2)/2. So that gives (k+1)(k+2)/2, which is exactly the formula for n = k+1. Therefore, by induction, the formula holds for all natural numbers n \u2265 1.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Maybe I should also try another method to double-check.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe using the concept of pairing terms or something visual. If I write the sum forwards and backwards and add them together, perhaps something cancels out.\n\nSo, writing the sum as S = 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n. If I write it backwards, it's S = n + (n-1) + (n-2) + ... + 1. Now, if I add these two equations together, term by term, I get:\n\n2S = (1 + n) + (2 + (n-1)) + (3 + (n-2)) + ... + ((n-1) + 2) + (n + 1).\n\nEach of these pairs adds up to n + 1. How many such pairs are there? There are n pairs because the sequence goes from 1 to n. So, 2S = n*(n + 1). Therefore, S = n*(n + 1)/2.\n\nThat's another way to see it, and it seems to confirm the formula. So, both methods work. I think I'm confident now that the identity holds for all natural numbers n \u2265 1.\n</think>\n\nTo prove that for all natural numbers \\( n \\geq 1 \\), the identity \\( 1 + 2 + 3 + \\dots + n = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} \\) holds, we can use mathematical induction.\n\n**Base Case:**\nFor \\( n = 1 \\):\n\\[ 1 = \\frac{1(1+1)}{2} = \\frac{2}{2} = 1 \\]\nThe base case is satisfied.\n\n**Inductive Step:**\nAssume the formula holds for some arbitrary natural number \\( k \\), i.e.,\n\\[ 1 + 2 + 3 + \\dots + k = \\frac{k(k+1)}{2} \\]\nWe need to show it holds for \\( k + 1 \\):\n\\[ 1 + 2 + 3 + \\dots + k + (k+1) \\]\nUsing the inductive hypothesis:\n\\[ \\frac{k(k+1)}{2} + (k+1) = (k+1)\\left( \\frac{k}{2} + 1 \\right) = (k+1)\\left( \\frac{k + 2}{2} \\right) = \\frac{(k+1)(k+2)}{2} \\]\nThus, the formula holds for \\( k + 1 \\).\n\nBy the principle of mathematical induction, the identity is true for all natural numbers \\( n \\geq 1 \\).\n\n**Alternative Method:**\nConsider the sum \\( S = 1 + 2 + 3 + \\dots + n \\). Writing \\( S \\) forwards and backwards:\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nS &= 1 + 2 + 3 + \\dots + (n-1) + n, \\\\\nS &= n + (n-1) + (n-2) + \\dots + 2 + 1.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nAdding these:\n\\[\n2S = (1 + n) + (2 + (n-1)) + \\dots + (n + 1).\n\\]\nEach pair sums to \\( n + 1 \\), and there are \\( n \\) such pairs:\n\\[\n2S = n(n + 1) \\implies S = \\frac{n(n + 1)}{2}.\n\\]\nHence, the identity is proven.\n\nDONE."
