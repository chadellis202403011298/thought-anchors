How many blocks must Sarah walk, and in which directions? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nTo determine the shortest path from the library to the grocery store, we can use the concept of right triangles. The library is located 3 blocks east and 2 blocks north of the town square, while the grocery store is 1 block east and 4 blocks north. By calculating the differences in the east and north directions, we can determine the total distance Sarah needs to walk.\n\nFirst, calculate the difference in the east direction:\nEast difference = Grocery store's east position - Library's east position\nEast difference = 1 block - 3 blocks = -2 blocks\n\nNext, calculate the difference in the north direction:\nNorth difference = Grocery store's north position - Library's north position\nNorth difference = 4 blocks - 2 blocks = 2 blocks\n\nThe total distance Sarah must walk is the sum of these differences, which forms the legs of a right triangle.

The grocery store is 1 block east and 4 blocks north of the town square. Sarah leaves the library and wants to reach the grocery store by taking the shortest possible route. How many blocks must Sarah walk, and in which directions? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so Sarah wants to go from the library to the grocery store, and she wants the shortest possible route. Let me figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to visualize the layout. The library is 3 blocks east and 2 blocks north of the town square. The grocery store is 1 block east and 4 blocks north of the town square. So, if I imagine the town square as the origin point (0,0), the library would be at (3,2) and the grocery store at (1,4).\n\nNow, to find the shortest path, I think Sarah should go in the direction that minimizes her walking distance. Since she's moving from one point to another on a grid, the shortest path would be a straight line, but since she can only move along the grid lines (east or north), she needs to go in the most efficient directions.\n\nLet me calculate the differences in the east and north directions. From the library to the grocery store:\n\nEast: 1 - 3 = -2 blocks (so she needs to go west, but since we can't go negative, she'll walk 2 blocks west)\nNorth: 4 - 2 = 2 blocks\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. If the grocery store is 1 block east and 4 north, and the library is 3 east and 2 north, then the grocery store is actually 2 blocks west and 2 blocks north from the library. So, to get from the library to the grocery store, Sarah needs to go west 2 blocks and north 2 blocks. But can she do that? Let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of the path in terms of net movement. From the library to the grocery store, she needs to move west 2 blocks (because 1 east - 3 east = -2) and north 2 blocks (4 north - 2 north = 2). So, she needs to go west 2 and north 2.\n\nBut wait, another way is to see the difference in east and north. From the library at (3,2) to the grocery store at (1,4), she needs to go west 2 and north 2. So the shortest path would be to go west 2 blocks and north 2 blocks. That makes sense because moving west and north directly towards the grocery store minimizes the total distance.\n\nSo, Sarah should walk 2 blocks west and 2 blocks north. That would total 4 blocks. Let me confirm: 2 west + 2 north = 4 blocks. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, could she take a different path? Like going east first, then north, but that would probably be longer. Let me check. If she goes east, she's going away from the grocery store, so that's not efficient. Similarly, going north first might be a bit, but not as efficient as going west and north directly.\n\nSo, the minimal path is 2 west and 2 north, totaling 4 blocks.\n</think>\n\nSarah needs to walk 2 blocks west and 2 blocks north, totaling 4 blocks.\n\n**Answer:** Sarah must walk 2 blocks west and 2 blocks north, totaling 4 blocks. DONE."
