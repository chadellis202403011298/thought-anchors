  "question": "In a small town, the library is 3 blocks east and 2 blocks north of the town square. The grocery store is 1 block east and 4 blocks north of the town square. Sarah leaves the library and wants to reach the grocery store by taking the shortest possible route. How many blocks must Sarah walk, and in which directions?",
  "answer": "To solve this problem, I need to visualize the relative positions of the library and grocery store on a grid.\n\nStep 1: Identify the coordinates of each location, using the town square as the origin (0,0).\n- Library: 3 blocks east, 2 blocks north = coordinates (3,2)\n- Grocery store: 1 block east, 4 blocks north = coordinates (1,4)\n\nStep 2: Determine the displacement from the library to the grocery store.\n- East/West displacement: 1 - 3 = -2 (negative means 2 blocks west)\n- North/South displacement: 4 - 2 = 2 (positive means 2 blocks north)\n\nStep 3: Calculate the shortest path.\n- Sarah needs to walk 2 blocks west and 2 blocks north.\n- The total distance is 2 + 2 = 4 blocks.\n\nTherefore, Sarah must walk 4 blocks in total: 2 blocks west and 2 blocks north to reach the grocery store from the library."
