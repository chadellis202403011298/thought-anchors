  "question": "A small business owner wants to increase foot traffic to their bookstore. They decide to use the SCAMPER ideation technique to generate novel ideas. If S stands for Substitute, C for Combine, A for Adapt, M for Modify, P for Put to another use, E for Eliminate, and R for Reverse/Rearrange, which of the following ideas most clearly represents the 'Combine' aspect of the SCAMPER technique?\n\nA) Replace physical books with e-readers\nB) Create a bookstore-caf\u00e9 hybrid where customers can read while enjoying coffee\nC) Remove all bookshelves to create more open space\nD) Change the store hours to open later and close later\nE) Flip the store layout so the entrance is at the back of the building",
  "answer": "The correct answer is B) Create a bookstore-caf\u00e9 hybrid where customers can read while enjoying coffee.\n\nReasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. The SCAMPER technique is an ideation method that helps generate new ideas by prompting specific types of modifications to an existing concept.\n\n2. Let's analyze what each letter in SCAMPER represents:\n   - S (Substitute): Replace elements with alternatives\n   - C (Combine): Merge or integrate with other elements or services\n   - A (Adapt): Alter to suit a different purpose or condition\n   - M (Modify): Change attributes like size, shape, or frequency\n   - P (Put to another use): Find different applications or contexts\n   - E (Eliminate): Remove components or simplify\n   - R (Reverse/Rearrange): Change order or orientation\n\n3. Now let's analyze each option:\n   - Option A (Replace physical books with e-readers): This represents 'Substitute' as it replaces traditional books with electronic alternatives.\n   - Option B (Create a bookstore-caf\u00e9 hybrid): This represents 'Combine' as it merges two different business concepts (bookstore and caf\u00e9) into one.\n   - Option C (Remove all bookshelves): This represents 'Eliminate' as it removes a component of the store.\n   - Option D (Change store hours): This represents 'Modify' as it alters an attribute of the business.\n   - Option E (Flip the store layout): This represents 'Reverse/Rearrange' as it changes the orientation of the store.\n\n4. Since we're specifically looking for an example of 'Combine,' the answer is B, which clearly demonstrates combining a bookstore with a caf\u00e9 to create a hybrid service offering."
