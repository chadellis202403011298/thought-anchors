  "question": "In a classroom of 30 students, each student is assigned a number from 1 to 25 (inclusive). Prove that there must be at least two students who are assigned the same number.",
  "answer": "This problem can be solved by applying the Pigeonhole Principle.\n\nStep 1: Identify the pigeons and pigeonholes.\nThe 30 students are the pigeons.\nThe 25 possible numbers (1 to 25 inclusive) are the pigeonholes.\n\nStep 2: Compare the number of pigeons to the number of pigeonholes.\nWe have 30 pigeons (students) and only 25 pigeonholes (possible numbers).\n\nStep 3: Apply the Pigeonhole Principle.\nThe Pigeonhole Principle states that if n pigeons are placed into m pigeonholes and n > m, then at least one pigeonhole must contain more than one pigeon.\n\nHere, n = 30 and m = 25, so n > m.\n\nStep 4: Draw the conclusion.\nSince we have more students (30) than available numbers (25), by the Pigeonhole Principle, at least two students must be assigned the same number.\n\nIn fact, we can say something stronger: at least 30 - 25 + 1 = 6 students must share their assigned number with at least one other student."
