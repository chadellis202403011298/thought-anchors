  "question": "A small town has five community centers (labeled A through E) that need to be connected by roads. The town council wants to ensure that people can travel between any two community centers, while minimizing the total length of roads that need to be built. Below are the distances (in kilometers) between each pair of community centers:\n\nA to B: 3 km\nA to C: 5 km\nA to D: 7 km\nA to E: 4 km\nB to C: 2 km\nB to D: 6 km\nB to E: 5 km\nC to D: 4 km\nC to E: 3 km\nD to E: 2 km\n\nWhat is the minimum total length of roads needed to connect all five community centers, and which specific connections should be built?",
  "answer": "To solve this problem, I need to find the minimum spanning tree of this network. A minimum spanning tree is a subset of the edges that connects all nodes while minimizing the total edge weight (road length in this case).\n\nI'll use Kruskal's algorithm, which works by sorting all edges by weight and adding them one by one, as long as they don't create a cycle:\n\nStep 1: Sort all connections by distance (ascending):\n- B to C: 2 km\n- D to E: 2 km\n- A to B: 3 km\n- C to E: 3 km\n- A to E: 4 km\n- C to D: 4 km\n- A to C: 5 km\n- B to E: 5 km\n- B to D: 6 km\n- A to D: 7 km\n\nStep 2: Start adding connections, avoiding cycles:\n- Add B to C: 2 km (connects B and C)\n- Add D to E: 2 km (connects D and E)\n- Add A to B: 3 km (connects A to the B-C component)\n- Add C to E: 3 km (connects the A-B-C component to the D-E component)\n\nAt this point, all five community centers are connected, so we stop.\n\nThe minimum total length is: 2 + 2 + 3 + 3 = 10 kilometers.\n\nThe specific connections to build are:\n1. Between centers B and C (2 km)\n2. Between centers D and E (2 km)\n3. Between centers A and B (3 km)\n4. Between centers C and E (3 km)"
