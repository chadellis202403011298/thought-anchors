  "question": "A startup company is developing a new smart water bottle that tracks water intake and reminds users to stay hydrated. They've created three different prototypes to test with potential users:\n\nPrototype A: A fully functional digital prototype with all intended features, but expensive to produce.\nPrototype B: A paper sketch with detailed annotations showing how the product would work.\nPrototype C: A physical mockup that looks like the final product but has no working technology inside.\n\nThe team has limited resources and can only conduct one round of user testing before making significant design decisions. If their primary goal is to gather authentic user feedback about the physical interaction with the product while minimizing development costs, which prototype should they use for testing, and why?",
  "answer": "The most appropriate choice is Prototype C: A physical mockup that looks like the final product but has no working technology inside.\n\nStep 1: Identify the key requirements from the problem statement.\n- The team needs to gather authentic user feedback about physical interaction.\n- They need to minimize development costs.\n- They only have one round of testing before making significant design decisions.\n\nStep 2: Evaluate each prototype against these requirements.\n\nPrototype A (Fully functional digital prototype):\n- Provides complete interaction experience\n- Very expensive to produce\n- Takes significant development time\n- Might be too polished, discouraging critical feedback\n\nPrototype B (Paper sketch with annotations):\n- Extremely low cost\n- Quick to produce\n- Cannot provide authentic physical interaction feedback\n- Users cannot hold, feel, or manipulate it realistically\n\nPrototype C (Physical mockup without technology):\n- Moderate cost (more than paper, less than functional)\n- Allows users to physically interact with the form factor\n- Users can hold it, test the ergonomics, and simulate usage\n- Cannot test the digital interface experience\n\nStep 3: Make a decision based on the primary goal.\n\nSince the primary goal is to gather feedback about physical interaction while minimizing costs, Prototype C provides the best balance. Users can experience how the bottle feels in their hands, how comfortable it is to carry, and other physical aspects that are crucial for a product that will be handled frequently throughout the day. The technology implementation can be refined later based on this fundamental physical feedback, preventing costly redesigns of the physical components after the technology is integrated."
