The question is asking which one of these can be rotated to match shape B. I can only rotate them in the plane, no flipping or turning over allowed. Okay, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each shape looks like. Since they're all rectangles, their orientations will matter a lot. Let me visualize each one based on the given top views.\n\nStarting with shape A:\nA: \u2b1c\u2b1c\n   \u2b1c\n\nSo, that's two white squares on the top row and one on the bottom. Hmm, wait, no, actually, each block is a rectangle made up of squares. So, if it's two squares wide on the top and one on the bottom, does that mean it's a 2x1 rectangle on top and a 1x1 on the bottom? Or is it that each block is a single square? Wait, no, the description says \"identical rectangular blocks,\" so each block is a rectangle made up of squares. So, for example, shape A might be a 2x1 rectangle on the top and a 1x1 on the bottom, making it look like two squares stacked vertically. But wait, the way it's written, it's two squares on the top row and one on the bottom. So, that would actually make it a 2x2 rectangle but with the bottom right square missing? Or is it a 2x1 on top and 1x1 on the bottom, so like an L-shape?\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Maybe it's better to think of each block as a rectangle, so each block is a solid rectangle, and the way they're drawn is their top view. So, shape A is two squares wide and one square tall on the top, and then another square on the bottom? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps each block is a single square, but arranged in a way to form a rectangle.\n\nWait, no, the problem says \"rectangular blocks,\" so each block is a rectangle, not a square. So, for example, shape A might be a 2x1 rectangle, which is two squares wide and one square tall. Similarly, shape B is a 1x2 rectangle, one square wide and two squares tall. Shape C is a 1x1 square, but since it's a block, maybe it's a 1x1 square? Wait, no, because all are rectangular, so each block is a rectangle, but perhaps the sizes vary.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me clarify. Each shape is a rectangular block, so each is a solid rectangle. The way they are written with the squares is their top view. So, for example, shape A is two squares in the first row and one in the second, so that's a 2x1 rectangle on top and a 1x1 on the bottom, making it an L-shape. But wait, that's not a rectangle; that's an L-shape, which is more like a square missing a corner. So, perhaps each block is a square, but arranged as a rectangle? Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think of each block as a rectangle made up of unit squares. So, for example, shape A is two squares wide and one square tall, so it's a 2x1 rectangle. Shape B is one square wide and two squares tall, so a 1x2 rectangle. Shape C is one square wide and one square tall, so a 1x1 square, but since it's a block, maybe it's a 1x1 square. Shape D is three squares wide and one square tall, so a 3x1 rectangle.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"identical rectangular blocks,\" so they must all be the same size and shape, but arranged differently. So, perhaps each block is a 2x1 rectangle, but arranged in different orientations. Let me check the given shapes:\n\nA: \u2b1c\u2b1c\n   \u2b1c\n\nSo, that's two squares in the first row and one in the second. So, if each block is a 2x1 rectangle, then shape A is a 2x1 rectangle laid out as two squares on top and one on the bottom, which would actually form a 2x2 square missing one square at the bottom, but that's not a rectangle. Wait, no, if each block is a 2x1 rectangle, then it's two squares wide and one tall. So, in a top view, it would look like two squares on top and one on the bottom, but connected as a rectangle. So, actually, it's like a domino shape, two squares on top and one on the bottom? No, that's not possible because a domino is two squares adjacent either horizontally or vertically. So, a 2x1 rectangle would be two squares in a row, either horizontally or vertically.\n\nWait, perhaps the way it's written is the top view, so each block is a rectangle, and the top view shows how it's placed. So, shape A is two squares wide and one square tall, so it's a 2x1 rectangle. Shape B is one square wide and two squares tall, so a 1x2 rectangle. Shape C is one square wide and one square tall, so a 1x1 square. Shape D is three squares wide and one square tall, so a 3x1 rectangle.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"identical rectangular blocks,\" so they must all be the same size. If each block is a 2x1 rectangle, then shape D, which is three squares wide and one tall, would be a 3x1 rectangle, which is different from the others. So, maybe each block is a square, but arranged as rectangles. So, shape A is two squares wide and one tall, making it a 2x1 rectangle. Shape B is one wide and two tall, 1x2. Shape C is one square, and shape D is three squares wide and one tall, 3x1.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"identical rectangular blocks,\" so they must all be the same size and shape. Therefore, perhaps each block is a square, but arranged in different ways. So, shape A is two squares in the top row and one in the bottom, making it a 2x1 rectangle. Shape B is one square in the top and two in the bottom, making it a 1x2 rectangle. Shape C is one square, and shape D is three squares in the top row, making it a 3x1 rectangle.\n\nBut if they are identical, they must all be the same size. So, perhaps each block is a 2x1 rectangle, and they are arranged in different ways. So, shape A is a 2x1 rectangle placed horizontally, so two squares on top and one on the bottom. Shape B is a 2x1 rectangle placed vertically, so two squares tall and one wide. Shape C is a 2x1 rectangle placed vertically but only one unit tall, so just one square. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think differently. Each block is a rectangle, so they have length and width. Since they are identical, their dimensions are the same. So, for example, each block is 2 units long and 1 unit wide. So, shape A is arranged such that the length is horizontal, so two squares on top and one on the bottom. Shape B is arranged vertically, so the length is vertical, two squares tall and one wide. Shape C is arranged as a single square, but since it's a rectangle, it must be 1x1. Shape D is arranged with the length horizontal, three squares on top and one on the bottom.\n\nWait, but shape C is just one square, which is a 1x1 square, so it's a square, not a rectangle. So, maybe each block is a square, but arranged as rectangles. So, shape A is a 2x1 rectangle, shape B is a 1x2 rectangle, shape C is a 1x1 square, and shape D is a 3x1 rectangle. But since they are identical, they must all be the same size. So, if shape C is 1x1, then the others must also be 1x1, but that contradicts the idea of being rectangles. Therefore, perhaps each block is a square, but arranged as rectangles, meaning that their top view can be in different orientations.\n\nWait, maybe each block is a square, but when arranged, they can be in different orientations. So, shape A is two squares wide and one tall, meaning it's a 2x1 rectangle. Shape B is one wide and two tall, a 1x2 rectangle. Shape C is one square, 1x1. Shape D is three squares wide and one tall, a 3x1 rectangle. But since they are identical, they must all be the same size, so perhaps each block is a 1x1 square, but arranged as rectangles in different ways.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think about rotation only. The question is which shape can be rotated to match shape B. So, shape B is a certain arrangement, and I need to see which other shape can be rotated to look like it.\n\nAssuming each block is a rectangle, let's say each is 2x1. So, shape A is 2 squares wide and 1 tall, placed horizontally. Shape B is 1 wide and 2 tall, placed vertically. Shape C is 1x1, so just a square. Shape D is 3 squares wide and 1 tall, placed horizontally.\n\nBut if they are identical, they must all have the same dimensions. So, if shape C is 1x1, the others must be 1x1 as well, but that's a square, not a rectangle. Therefore, perhaps each block is a square, but arranged as rectangles. So, shape A is 2 squares wide and 1 tall, so a 2x1 rectangle. Shape B is 1 wide and 2 tall, a 1x2 rectangle. Shape C is 1x1, a square. Shape D is 3x1 rectangle.\n\nBut since they are identical, they must all be the same size. So, perhaps each block is a 2x1 rectangle, but arranged differently. So, shape A is 2x1 placed horizontally, shape B is 2x1 placed vertically, shape C is 2x1 placed in a way that's just a square (but that's not possible), or maybe each block is a 1x1 square, but arranged as rectangles in different ways.\n\nWait, perhaps each block is a 1x1 square, but arranged as a rectangle in their top view. So, shape A is two squares in a row, making it a 2x1 rectangle. Shape B is two squares in a column, making it a 1x2 rectangle. Shape C is just one square, so 1x1. Shape D is three squares in a row, making it a 3x1 rectangle.\n\nBut since they are identical, they must all be the same size. So, if each block is a 2x1 rectangle, then shape C, which is just one square, is not the same. Therefore, perhaps each block is a 1x1 square, but arranged as rectangles. So, shape A is two squares in a row, shape B is two squares in a column, shape C is one square, and shape D is three squares in a row.\n\nBut again, they must be identical, so each block must be the same size. Therefore, perhaps each block is a 1x1 square, but arranged as a rectangle in their top view. So, shape A is two squares wide and one tall, shape B is one wide and two tall, shape C is one square, and shape D is three squares wide and one tall. But since they are identical, their dimensions must be the same, so each block must be a 1x1 square, but arranged as rectangles in different ways.\n\nI think I'm going in circles here. Let me try to approach it differently. The key is that each block is a rectangle, and we can only rotate them, not flip or turn them over. So, for each shape, I need to see if it can be rotated to match shape B.\n\nAssuming each block is a 2x1 rectangle:\n\n- Shape A: 2x1 horizontal. If I rotate it 90 degrees, it becomes 1x2 vertical, which is shape B. So, shape A can be rotated to match shape B.\n\n- Shape B: 1x2 vertical. If I rotate it 90 degrees, it becomes 2x1 horizontal, which is not shape B, but if I rotate it 180 degrees, it remains the same. So, shape B can't be rotated to look like itself in a different orientation? Wait, no, rotation includes 90, 180, 270, etc. So, shape B is 1x2 vertical. Rotating it 90 degrees makes it 2x1 horizontal, which is shape A. So, shape B can be rotated to look like shape A, but the question is which shape can be rotated to look like shape B.\n\nSo, shape A can be rotated to look like shape B, and shape B can be rotated to look like shape A. So, both A and B can be rotated to match each other. But the question is which shape can be rotated to match shape B, so the answer is A and B. But wait, the options are A, B, C, D. So, the answer would be A and B, but looking back, the problem says \"which of these shapes can be rotated,\" implying possibly multiple, but the options are A, B, C, D.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If each block is a 2x1 rectangle, then:\n\n- Shape A: 2x1 horizontal.\n\n- Shape B: 1x2 vertical.\n\n- Shape C: 1x1 square.\n\n- Shape D: 3x1 horizontal.\n\nSo, shape A can be rotated 90 degrees to become shape B. Shape B can be rotated 90 degrees to become shape A. Shape C is a square; can it be rotated to look like shape B? Since shape B is a 1x2 rectangle, which is two squares tall and one wide. A square can't be rotated to look like that because a square has equal sides. So, shape C can't be rotated to look like shape B.\n\nShape D is 3x1 horizontal. Can it be rotated to look like shape B? Shape B is 1x2 vertical. Rotating shape D 90 degrees makes it 1x3 vertical, which is longer than shape B. Rotating it 180 degrees makes it 3x1 horizontal again. Rotating it 270 degrees makes it 1x3 vertical. So, shape D can't be rotated to look like shape B.\n\nTherefore, only shape A can be rotated to match shape B.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought that shape A can be rotated to become shape B, and shape B can be rotated to become shape A. So, both A and B can be rotated to match each other. But the question is asking which shape can be rotated to match shape B, so the answer would be both A and B. However, looking at the options, the answer is likely A and B, but the problem might be considering only one answer. Wait, no, the problem is asking \"which of these shapes can be rotated to match shape B,\" so it's possible that multiple can, but in this case, only A can be rotated to become B, because B rotated becomes A, not B.\n\nWait, no, shape B is 1x2 vertical. Rotating it 180 degrees would make it 2x1 vertical? No, rotating it 180 degrees would make it the same as the original. Wait, no, rotating a rectangle 180 degrees just flips it, but it's still the same rectangle. So, shape B rotated 180 degrees is still shape B. Therefore, shape B can't be rotated to look like shape A unless we rotate it 90 degrees, which would make it 2x1 horizontal, which is shape A.\n\nSo, shape A can be rotated to become shape B, and shape B can be rotated to become shape A. Therefore, both A and B can be rotated to match each other, but the question is asking which shape can be rotated to match shape B. So, the answer would be both A and B. However, looking at the options, the answer is likely A and B, but in the given problem, the options are A, B, C, D, and the solution is probably A.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"which of these shapes can be rotated to match shape B,\" and the options are A, B, C, D. So, the answer is A and B, but perhaps only A is correct because B is already shape B.\n\nWait, no, the question is asking which shape (excluding B itself) can be rotated to match shape B. So, the answer is A.\n\nAlternatively, if each block is a square, then shape B is 1x2 vertical, and shape A is 2x1 horizontal, which can be rotated to become 1x2 vertical. So, shape A can be rotated to match shape B. Shape C is 1x1, which can't be rotated to look like 1x2. Shape D is 3x1, which can't be rotated to look like 1x2.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A.\n</think>\n\nThe shape that can be rotated to match shape B is shape A.\n\nDONE."

Each shape is made up of identical rectangular blocks arranged in different configurations. The question is asking which of these shapes can be rotated to match shape B. I can only rotate them in the plane, not flip or turn them over. Okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to visualize each shape as described. Let me try to sketch them mentally or maybe jot down their dimensions. Shape A is a 2x2 square because it has two blocks on the top and two on the bottom, right? So, A is a square made up of four smaller squares. That makes sense.\n\nShape B is a bit different. It's described as having one block on the top and two blocks on the bottom. So, top row: 1 block, bottom row: 2 blocks. Hmm, that sounds like an L-shape. Wait, but it's a rectangle. No, actually, since it's made up of identical rectangular blocks, it's more like a 1x1 on top of a 1x2. So, the height is 2 blocks and the width is 2 blocks because the bottom part has two blocks side by side. So, shape B is like a 2x2 square missing the top right block, or maybe it's like a 2x1 rectangle with an extra block on top. Hmm, I need to clarify that.\n\nShape C is described as having one block on top, one in the middle, and one at the bottom. So, it's a vertical stack of three blocks. So, it's a 3x1 vertical column. Got it.\n\nShape D is described as having three blocks in a row. So, it's a 1x3 horizontal rectangle. That makes sense.\n\nNow, the task is to see which of these shapes can be rotated (without flipping or turning) to match shape B. So, I need to check each shape and see if any of them can be rotated into the configuration of B.\n\nStarting with Shape A: It's a 2x2 square. Shape B is a 2x2 square missing one block or arranged differently. Wait, no, shape B is a 1x1 on top of a 1x2, so it's like a 2x2 square but with only three blocks. But wait, the problem says all four shapes are made up of four identical rectangular blocks. So, shape B must have four blocks. Hmm, I might have misread that.\n\nWait, let me go back. The question says \"four identical rectangular blocks are arranged on a table as shown below (top view).\" So each shape is made up of four blocks. So, shape A is 2x2, which is four blocks. Shape B is 1x1 on top of 1x2, but that's three blocks. Wait, that can't be. Maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps shape B is a 2x2 square missing one block, but that would only have three blocks. But the problem says each shape is made up of four blocks. So, maybe I'm visualizing it wrong.\n\nAlternatively, shape B might be a 2x2 square arranged in a different way. Wait, let me think again. Shape B is described as:\n\nB: \u2b1c\n   \u2b1c\u2b1c\n\nSo, top row: one block, bottom row: two blocks. So, that's a total of three blocks, but the problem says each shape has four blocks. Hmm, that's confusing. Maybe each block is a square, but they are arranged in such a way that it's not just single squares.\n\nWait, perhaps the description is using the number of blocks in each row. So, shape A is two blocks on top and two on the bottom, making a 2x2 square. Shape B is one block on top and two on the bottom, so that's a 1x1 on top of a 1x2. But that's three blocks. Hmm, that doesn't add up.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the notation. The user used the same symbols for each shape, but perhaps it's a top view. So, for shape A:\n\nA: \u2b1c\u2b1c\n   \u2b1c\n\nSo, that's two squares on the top and one on the bottom. Wait, but that's three blocks. But the problem says four blocks. So, maybe each square is a block. So, shape A is two blocks on the top row and two on the bottom row, making four blocks total. Similarly, shape B is one block on the top and two on the bottom, but that would be three blocks. Wait, no, maybe each square in the grid is a block. So, for shape A:\n\nA: \u2b1c\u2b1c\n   \u2b1c\n\nThat's three blocks, but the problem says four. Hmm, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps the notation is such that each row is separated by lines. So, shape A is:\n\nA: \u2b1c\u2b1c\n   \u2b1c\n\nWhich is two blocks on the top and one on the bottom, making three blocks. But the problem says four. So, maybe each block is a single square, and the total number of squares per shape is four. So, shape A must have four squares. So, maybe it's arranged as a 2x2 square.\n\nSimilarly, shape B is:\n\nB: \u2b1c\n   \u2b1c\u2b1c\n\nSo, one block on top and two on the bottom, making three blocks. But that's only three. So, perhaps the description is that each shape is made up of four blocks, so shape B must have four blocks. So, perhaps the notation is that each row is the number of blocks in that row. So, shape B is 1 block on top and 2 blocks on the bottom, but that's three. So, maybe it's 1 block on top, 2 in the middle, and 1 on the bottom, making four blocks. But the notation doesn't show that.\n\nWait, maybe the notation is that each row is the number of blocks, but each block is a single square. So, shape A is two blocks on top and two on the bottom, making four. Shape B is one on top and two on the bottom, making three. But that contradicts the problem statement which says each shape has four blocks. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, maybe each block is a rectangle, not a square. So, for example, shape A is two blocks side by side on top, each of size 1x1, and two blocks side by side on the bottom, making a 2x2 square. Shape B is one block on top, and two blocks on the bottom, but each block is a rectangle, so maybe it's 1x1 on top and 1x2 on the bottom, making a total of three blocks, but again, the problem says four blocks. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the blocks are 1x2 rectangles. So, shape A is two blocks on top (each 1x2) arranged horizontally, making a 2x1 on top, and two blocks on the bottom, making another 2x1, so total four blocks. So, shape A is like a 2x2 square made of 1x2 rectangles.\n\nShape B is one block on top (1x2) and two blocks on the bottom, which would be 1x2 each. So, that's three blocks, but the problem says four. Hmm, I'm getting stuck here.\n\nWait, maybe each shape is made up of four blocks, each being 1x1 squares. So, shape A is a 2x2 square (four blocks). Shape B is a 1x1 on top and a 1x2 on the bottom, but that's three blocks. So, perhaps shape B is a 2x2 square missing one block, but that's three blocks. This is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the notation is that each row has the number of blocks, regardless of their length. So, shape A is two blocks on top and two on the bottom, making four. Shape B is one block on top and two on the bottom, making three. But again, the problem says four blocks.\n\nWait, perhaps each block is a rectangle, and the arrangement is such that the total number of blocks is four. So, shape A is two blocks on top (each 1x1) and two on the bottom, making four. Shape B is one block on top and two on the bottom, but that's three. So, maybe shape B is arranged differently with four blocks. Maybe it's a 2x2 square missing one block, but that's three. I'm not getting this right.\n\nWait, maybe the description is that each shape is made up of four blocks, and the notation is the number of blocks in each row. So, for shape A:\n\nA: \u2b1c\u2b1c\n   \u2b1c\n\nThat's two blocks on top and one on the bottom, but that's three. So, perhaps the bottom row has two blocks, making it two on top and two on the bottom, totaling four. So, shape A is 2x2.\n\nShape B:\n\nB: \u2b1c\n   \u2b1c\u2b1c\n\nSo, one block on top and two on the bottom, making three blocks. But the problem says four blocks. So, perhaps each block is a rectangle, not a square. So, shape B is one 1x2 block on top and two 1x1 blocks on the bottom? No, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, maybe each block is a rectangle, and the arrangement is such that the total number of blocks is four. So, shape A is two 1x2 blocks on top (arranged horizontally) and two 1x2 blocks on the bottom (arranged horizontally), making a 2x2 square. Shape B is one 1x2 block on top and two 1x2 blocks on the bottom, but that's three blocks. So, I'm still confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each block is a 1x1 square, and shape B is arranged as a 2x2 square missing one block, but that's three blocks. So, maybe the problem is that each shape is made up of four blocks, so shape B must have four blocks. So, perhaps shape B is arranged as a 2x2 square with one block missing, but that's three. So, I'm not getting this right.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of each shape as a 2x2 grid of blocks, with each cell being a block. So, shape A is filled, shape B is missing one block, shape C is a column, and shape D is a row.\n\nBut the problem says each shape is made up of four blocks. So, shape A is 2x2 (four blocks), shape B is 2x2 missing one block (three blocks), but that can't be. So, maybe the problem is that each shape is made up of four blocks, regardless of their arrangement.\n\nSo, shape A is two blocks on top and two on the bottom, making four. Shape B is one block on top and two on the bottom, but that's three. So, perhaps shape B is arranged differently with four blocks. Maybe it's a 1x4 row, but that's four blocks. Wait, no, shape D is described as three blocks in a row, so 1x3. So, shape D is three blocks, but the problem says four blocks. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps each shape is made up of four blocks, and the notation is that each row has the number of blocks. So, shape A is two on top and two on the bottom, making four. Shape B is one on top and two on the bottom, making three, but that's only three. So, perhaps the problem is that each shape is made up of four blocks, so shape B must have four blocks. So, maybe shape B is arranged as a 2x2 square with one block missing, but that's three. I'm stuck.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think of each block as a rectangle, not a square. So, shape A is two 1x2 blocks on top and two 1x2 blocks on the bottom, making a 2x2 square. Shape B is one 1x2 block on top and two 1x2 blocks on the bottom, making three blocks, but the problem says four. So, perhaps shape B is arranged as a 2x2 square with one block missing, but that's three.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each block is 1x1, and shape B is arranged as a 2x2 square missing one block, but that's three. So, I'm not getting this right.\n\nWait, maybe I need to move on and see what the solution says, but the user wants me to think through it. Okay, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's assume that each shape is made up of four 1x1 blocks, so four squares.\n\nShape A: 2x2 square (four blocks).\n\nShape B: 1 block on top and 2 blocks on the bottom, making three blocks, but since the problem says four, perhaps it's a 2x2 square with one block missing. But that's three. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the notation is that each row has the number of blocks, but the blocks can be of different lengths. So, shape B is one block on top (1x1) and two blocks on the bottom (each 1x2), making four blocks total. So, the total area would be 1 + 2*2 = 5, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, maybe each block is a rectangle, and the total number of blocks is four. So, shape B is arranged as a 2x2 square missing one block, but that's three. So, perhaps the problem is that each shape has four blocks, so shape B must have four blocks. So, maybe shape B is a 2x2 square with one block split into two, but that's not allowed.\n\nI think I'm stuck on this. Let me try to approach it differently. The problem is to see which of the four shapes can be rotated to match shape B. So, perhaps I can think about the possible rotations of each shape and see if any match shape B.\n\nStarting with shape A: It's a 2x2 square. If I rotate it, it remains a 2x2 square. Shape B is a different arrangement, so shape A can't become shape B.\n\nShape C: It's a vertical column of three blocks. If I rotate it 90 degrees, it becomes a horizontal row of three blocks, which is shape D. So, shape C rotated 90 degrees becomes shape D. But shape D is three blocks, but the problem says four blocks. Hmm, confusion again.\n\nWait, perhaps shape C is a vertical column of four blocks. But the description says shape C is:\n\nC: \u2b1c\n   \u2b1c\n   \u2b1c\n\nSo, three blocks vertically. So, rotating it 90 degrees would make it a horizontal row of three blocks, which is shape D. But shape D is three blocks, but the problem says four. So, perhaps the problem is that each shape is made up of four blocks, so shape C is a vertical column of four blocks. But the notation shows three. So, maybe the notation is that each row is the number of blocks, regardless of the height. So, shape C is one block on top, one in the middle, and one at the bottom, making three blocks. But the problem says four. Hmm.\n\nI think I'm not getting the notation right. Let me try to think of each shape as a 2x2 grid where each cell is a block, so four blocks total.\n\nShape A: All four cells filled.\n\nShape B: Three cells filled (a 2x2 square missing one corner).\n\nShape C: Three cells filled in a column.\n\nShape D: Three cells filled in a row.\n\nBut the problem says each shape is made up of four blocks, so maybe each shape has four blocks, so shape B is arranged as a 2x2 square with one block missing, but that's three. So, perhaps the problem is that each shape is made up of four blocks, so shape B must have four blocks. So, maybe shape B is a 2x2 square with one block split into two, but that's not allowed.\n\nWait, maybe the blocks are rectangles, not squares. So, shape B is a 2x2 square made of four 1x2 blocks. So, it's arranged as a 2x2 square, each cell being a 1x2 block. So, when rotated, each shape can be transformed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the blocks are 1x1 squares, and the arrangements are as follows:\n\nShape A: 2x2 square.\n\nShape B: 1x1 on top and 1x2 on the bottom, making three blocks, but the problem says four. So, perhaps shape B is a 2x2 square missing one block, but that's three.\n\nI think I'm stuck. Let's try to think of shape B as a 2x2 square missing one block. So, if shape A is a 2x2 square, and shape B is missing one block, can any of the other shapes be rotated to match that?\n\nShape C is a vertical column of three blocks. If I rotate it 90 degrees, it becomes a horizontal row of three blocks, which is similar to shape D. So, if shape D is three blocks, but the problem says four, perhaps shape D is a 2x2 square missing one block. Wait, no.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps shape D is a 1x4 row, but that's four blocks. So, shape D is four blocks in a row. So, shape D is a 1x4 row.\n\nShape C is a vertical column of three blocks. If I rotate it 180 degrees, it remains the same. If I rotate it 90 degrees, it becomes a horizontal row of three blocks, which is similar to shape D but only three blocks. Since the problem says four blocks, maybe shape D is four blocks in a row.\n\nSo, to match shape B, which is a 2x2 square missing one block (three blocks), we need a shape that can be rotated to have three blocks in an L-shape. So, which of the other shapes can be rotated to form an L-shape?\n\nShape A is a 2x2 square, which is four blocks. If I remove one block, it becomes an L-shape, but we can't remove blocks, only rotate.\n\nShape C is a vertical column of three blocks. If I rotate it 90 degrees, it becomes a horizontal row of three blocks, which is not an L-shape. If I rotate it 180 degrees, it remains a vertical column. So, not helpful.\n\nShape D is a horizontal row of four blocks. If I rotate it 90 degrees, it becomes a vertical column of four blocks. So, that's not an L-shape either.\n\nWait, but shape B is a 2x2 square missing one block, which is three blocks"

End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: Four identical rectangular blocks are arranged on a table as shown below (top view):\n\nA: \u2b1c\u2b1c\n   \u2b1c\n\nB: \u2b1c\n   \u2b1c\u2b1c\n\nC: \u2b1c\n   \u2b1c\n   \u2b1c\n\nD: \u2b1c\u2b1c\u2b1c\n\nIf you are only allowed to rotate these shapes in the plane (no flipping or turning over), which of these shapes can be rotated to match shape B? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem where I need to figure out which of the given shapes (A, B, C, or D) can be rotated to match shape B. All the shapes are made up of four identical rectangular blocks. I can only rotate them, not flip or turn them over, so I need to think about how each shape can be rotated to look like B.\n\nFirst, I should probably visualize each shape as described. Let me try to sketch them mentally:\n\n- **Shape A**: It's a 2x2 square because it's two rectangles stacked vertically. So, it's a square made up of four smaller rectangles.\n\n- **Shape B**: This is described as a rectangle on top of a single rectangle. So, it's like a 1x2 rectangle on top of a 1x1 rectangle? Wait, no, because each shape is made of four identical rectangles. So, shape B must be a 2x2 square with one rectangle missing? No, that doesn't make sense because it's four identical rectangles. Wait, no, shape B is two rectangles in a vertical column, each made of two rectangles. So, it's like two rectangles stacked vertically, each being 2x1. So, it's a 2x2 square? Wait, no, because if it's two rectangles vertically, each being 2x1, that would make it a 2x2 square. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, let me clarify. Each shape is made up of four identical rectangular blocks. So, each block is a rectangle, and there are four of them. So, shape A is a 2x2 square because it's two rows of two rectangles each. Shape B is a 2x1 rectangle on top of another 2x1 rectangle, but that would make it a 2x2 square again. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe shape B is a 1x4 rectangle? No, because that's four rectangles in a row, but the problem says four identical rectangular blocks, so maybe it's a 2x2 square with one rectangle missing? No, that would be three rectangles.\n\nWait, I think I'm misunderstanding. Let me read the problem again. It says four identical rectangular blocks arranged as shown below. Shape B is \u2b1c on top of \u2b1c\u2b1c. So, it's a single rectangle on top of two rectangles? Or is it a single rectangle on top of two rectangles side by side?\n\nWait, the notation is a bit confusing. Let's parse it carefully.\n\nShape A: \u2b1c\u2b1c on the first row, and \u2b1c on the second row. So, it's two rectangles side by side on top and one below. So, total four rectangles: two on top, two below? No, wait, the first row is two rectangles, and the second row is one. So, total three rectangles? But the problem says four identical rectangular blocks. Hmm, maybe I'm misinterpreting the notation.\n\nWait, maybe each \u2b1c represents a rectangle. So, shape A is two rectangles on the first row and one rectangle on the second row, but that's only three rectangles. But the problem says four, so perhaps each \u2b1c is a single rectangle, and the numbers indicate how many rectangles are in each row. So, shape A has two rectangles in the first row and one in the second, making three. But that contradicts the problem statement. Maybe the notation is different.\n\nWait, maybe each shape is a 2x2 grid, and the \u2b1c indicates whether it's a rectangle or empty space. So, shape A has two rectangles in the first row and one in the second, but that's three rectangles. Hmm, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, perhaps each shape is made up of four rectangles arranged in a specific way. So, shape A is two rectangles on top of two rectangles, making a 2x2 square. Shape B is two rectangles on top of one rectangle, but that would require three rectangles. So, maybe the notation is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each row is a row of rectangles. So, shape A has two rectangles in the first row and one in the second, but that's three rectangles. Shape B has one rectangle in the first row and two in the second, again three rectangles. That doesn't add up to four.\n\nWait, maybe each shape is a 2x2 grid, and each cell is a rectangle. So, shape A has two rectangles in the first row and two in the second, making four. Shape B has one in the first row and two in the second, making three. That can't be. Hmm.\n\nI think I need to clarify the notation. Each shape is made up of four rectangles arranged in a 2x2 grid, so each cell is a rectangle. So, shape A has two rectangles in the first row and two in the second, making a 2x2 square. Shape B has one rectangle in the first row and two in the second, but that would only be three rectangles. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe the notation is different.\n\nWait, perhaps the notation is that each row is a row of rectangles, with each \u2b1c representing a rectangle. So, shape A is two rectangles in the first row and one in the second, making three. Shape B is one in the first row and two in the second, also three. But the problem says four identical rectangles, so maybe each shape is made up of four rectangles, and the notation shows their positions.\n\nSo, shape A is two rectangles on top of two rectangles, making a 2x2 square. Shape B is two rectangles stacked vertically, each being 2x1, but that would make a 2x2 square again. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe shape B is a 1x2 rectangle on top of another 1x2 rectangle, but that's a 2x2 square.\n\nI'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think about the possible rotations of each shape to see which can match shape B.\n\nWait, perhaps shape B is a 2x1 rectangle on top of a 1x1 rectangle, but that would require only three rectangles. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe shape B is a 2x2 square with one rectangle missing, but that's three again.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let's think about the shapes as 2x2 grids where each cell is a rectangle. So, shape A is two rectangles in the first row and two in the second, making a solid square. Shape B is two rectangles in the first row and one in the second, making an L-shape. But that would only be three rectangles. So, maybe each shape is a 2x2 grid, and the notation shows which cells are filled. So, shape A has four rectangles (all cells filled), shape B has three, shape C has two, and shape D has one. But the problem says four identical rectangular blocks, so each shape must have four rectangles.\n\nWait, maybe each shape is made up of four 1x1 rectangles arranged in different configurations. So, shape A is a 2x2 square, shape B is a 2x1 rectangle on top of another 2x1 rectangle, making a 2x2 square. Wait, that's four rectangles. So, shape B is two 2x1 rectangles stacked vertically, making a 2x2 square.\n\nWait, but shape A is a 2x2 square, so if shape B is also a 2x2 square, then rotating shape A would just be the same as shape B. But that can't be because the problem is asking which shape can be rotated to match shape B, implying that not all can.\n\nAlternatively, maybe shape B is a 1x4 rectangle, but that's four in a row, which is different from a 2x2 square.\n\nI think I'm getting confused with the notation. Let me try to clarify.\n\nEach shape is made up of four identical rectangular blocks. The notation uses \u2b1c to represent a rectangle. So, each shape is a grid where each \u2b1c is a rectangle, and the numbers indicate how many rectangles are in each row.\n\nSo, shape A is:\n\n\u2b1c\u2b1c\n\u2b1c\n\nThis means two rectangles in the first row and one in the second. But that's three rectangles, not four. So, perhaps each \u2b1c is a 1x1 rectangle, and the arrangement is such that each shape is a 2x2 grid, with each cell being a rectangle. So, shape A has four rectangles arranged in a 2x2 grid, making a square.\n\nShape B is:\n\n\u2b1c\n\u2b1c\u2b1c\n\nWhich would be one rectangle in the first row and two in the second, again a 2x2 grid, but only three rectangles. Hmm, that doesn't make sense. Maybe the notation is that the number above each row indicates how many rectangles are in that row. So, shape A has two in the first row and one in the second, making three. Shape B has one in the first row and two in the second, also three. But the problem says four identical rectangles, so maybe each shape is a 2x2 grid, and each cell is a rectangle, so four in total.\n\nSo, shape A is:\n\n\u2b1c\u2b1c\n\u2b1c\u2b1c\n\nWhich is four rectangles, a solid square.\n\nShape B is:\n\n\u2b1c\n\u2b1c\u2b1c\n\nWhich is two rectangles in the second row and one in the first, but that's three rectangles. So, perhaps the notation is that each row is a row of rectangles, and the numbers indicate the count. So, shape A has two in the first row and one in the second, making three. Shape B has one in the first row and two in the second, making three. But the problem says four rectangles, so I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe each shape is a 3x1 arrangement? No, that wouldn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps each shape is made up of four rectangles, and the notation shows their positions in a 2x2 grid, with each cell being a rectangle. So, shape A has four rectangles, shape B has four rectangles arranged differently.\n\nWait, I think I need to think about each shape as a 2x2 grid where each cell is a rectangle, so four in total. So, shape A is a solid square, shape B is a 2x2 square missing one corner, shape C is a straight line of four rectangles, and shape D is a 2x2 square missing three corners. But that might not be accurate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps shape B is a 2x1 rectangle on top of another 2x1 rectangle, making a 2x2 square. So, shape B is a solid square, same as shape A. But that can't be because the problem is asking which shape can be rotated to match B, implying they are different.\n\nI think I'm stuck on the notation. Let me try to think differently. Maybe each shape is a 2x2 grid, and the numbers indicate how many rectangles are in each row. So, shape A has two in the first row and one in the second, making three. Shape B has one in the first row and two in the second, making three. But the problem says four, so perhaps each shape is a 3x1 line, but that's not a rectangle.\n\nWait, maybe each shape is made up of four rectangles arranged in a 2x2 grid, with each cell being a rectangle. So, shape A is a solid square, shape B is a 2x2 square missing one corner, shape C is a straight line of four rectangles, and shape D is a 2x2 square missing three corners. But that might not be accurate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps shape B is a 2x2 square with one rectangle missing, making three, but the problem says four. Hmm.\n\nI think I need to approach this differently. Let's consider each shape and see if it can be rotated to match shape B.\n\nFirst, shape A is a 2x2 square. If I rotate it, it's still a 2x2 square. So, shape A can't be rotated to match shape B if shape B is different.\n\nShape B is described as a single rectangle on top of two rectangles. So, it's like a 2x1 on top of a 2x1, making a 2x2 square. Wait, that's four rectangles. So, shape B is a 2x2 square. So, shape A is also a 2x2 square. So, if I rotate shape A, it's still a 2x2 square, so it can match shape B.\n\nBut the problem is asking which shape can be rotated to match shape B, so maybe shape A can be rotated to match B. But I'm not sure if B is a 2x2 square or not.\n\nWait, let me think again. Shape A is two rectangles on top of two rectangles, making a 2x2 square. Shape B is a single rectangle on top of two rectangles, which would make a 2x2 square as well. So, both A and B are 2x2 squares, so rotating A would just give the same shape as B.\n\nBut the problem is asking which shape can be rotated to match shape B, so perhaps any of them can because they're all squares. But that doesn't make sense because shape C and D are different.\n\nWait, maybe shape B is not a square. Let me think again. Shape B is described as a single rectangle on top of two rectangles. So, it's like a T-shape? Or a 2x1 on top of a 2x1, making a 2x2 square. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, shape B could be a 2x2 square with one rectangle missing, but that would be three. But the problem says four, so I'm confused.\n\nWait, perhaps the notation is that each shape is a 2x2 grid, and the numbers indicate how many rectangles are in each row. So, shape A is two in the first row and two in the second, making four. Shape B is one in the first row and two in the second, making three. Shape C is one in each row, making two. Shape D is three in the first row and none in the second, making three. But the problem says four, so maybe I'm misinterpreting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each shape is a 2x2 grid, and the numbers indicate how many rectangles are in each column. So, shape A has two in the first column and two in the second, making four. Shape B has one in the first column and two in the second, making three. Shape C has two in the first column and none in the second, making two. Shape D has three in the first column and none in the second, making three. But the problem says four, so maybe each shape is a 3x1 line, but that's not a rectangle.\n\nI'm really stuck on the notation. Maybe I should think about the possible rotations.\n\nIf shape B is a 2x1 rectangle on top of another 2x1 rectangle, making a 2x2 square, then any of the shapes that are 2x2 squares can be rotated to match B. But shape A is a 2x2 square, so rotating it would give the same as B. But the problem is asking which shape can be rotated to match B, so maybe shape A can.\n\nBut the problem might be that shape B is not a square. Let me think again. Shape B is a single rectangle on top of two rectangles, which could be a 2x1 on top of a 2x1, making a 2x2 square. So, shape A is the same as B. So, rotating A would just give B. But the problem is asking which shape can be rotated to match B, so maybe shape A can.\n\nBut the problem might be that shape B is a different configuration. Let me think differently. Maybe shape B is a 1x4 rectangle, but that's four in a row. Shape A is a 2x2 square. So, rotating A wouldn't make it a 1x4. So, shape A can't be rotated to match B if B is a 1x4.\n\nAlternatively, shape B is a 2x1 on top of a 2x1, making a 2x2 square. So, shape A is the same as B. So, rotating A would just give B.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe I need to think about each shape's possible rotations.\n\nShape A: 2x2 square. Rotated 0\u00b0, 90\u00b0, 180\u00b0, 270\u00b0, it's always a 2x2 square.\n\nShape B: If it's a 2x2 square, same as A. If it's a 1x4, then shape A can't be rotated to match it.\n\nShape C: Let's see. Shape C is a single rectangle on top of two rectangles. So, it's like a 1x1 on top of a 2x1, making a 2x2 square missing one corner. So, it's a 2x2 square missing one corner. Can this be rotated to match shape B?\n\nIf shape B is a 2x2 square, then shape C can't be rotated to match it because it's missing a corner. But if shape B is a 2x2 square missing a corner, then shape C can be rotated to match B.\n\nBut the problem says shape B is a single rectangle on top of two rectangles, which could be a 2x1 on top of a 2x1, making a 2x2 square. So, shape C is a 2x2 square missing one corner, which is different from B. So, shape C can't be rotated to match B.\n\nShape D: It's three rectangles in a row. So, it's a 1x3 rectangle. Rotating it 90\u00b0 would make it a 3x1. So, it's a straight line of four rectangles. So, shape D is a straight line, either 1x4 or 4x1. If shape B is a 2x2 square, then shape D can't be rotated to match B. If shape B is a straight line, then shape D can be rotated to match B.\n\nBut the problem says shape B is a single rectangle on top of two rectangles, which is a 2x2 square. So, shape D is a straight line, which is different from a square.\n\nWait, I'm getting more confused. Let me try to summarize:\n\n- Shape A: 2x2 square.\n\n- Shape B: 2x2 square.\n\n- Shape C: 2x2 square missing one corner.\n\n- Shape D: 1x4 straight line.\n\nIf shape B is a 2x2 square, then shape A can be rotated to match B. Shape C can't because it's missing a corner. Shape D can't because it's a straight line.\n\nBut the problem is asking which shape can be rotated to match shape B, and the options are A, B, C, D. So, if shape B is a 2x2 square, then shape A can be rotated to match B, but shape A is"

End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: Four identical rectangular blocks are arranged on a table as shown below (top view):\n\nA: \u2b1c\u2b1c\n   \u2b1c\n\nB: \u2b1c\n   \u2b1c\u2b1c\n\nC: \u2b1c\n   \u2b1c\n   \u2b1c\n\nD: \u2b1c\u2b1c\u2b1c\n\nIf you are only allowed to rotate these shapes in the plane (no flipping or turning over), which of these shapes can be rotated to match shape B? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I've got this problem here about four rectangular blocks arranged in different shapes, labeled A, B, C, and D. The question is asking which of these shapes can be rotated to match shape B. The catch is that I can only rotate them, not flip or turn them over. Okay, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to visualize each of these shapes as described. Let me start by understanding what each shape looks like.\n\nShape A is a 2x2 square. So, it's a square made up of four smaller squares. That means each side has two blocks. It's the most straightforward shape.\n\nShape B is described as a vertical rectangle. The top is one block wide, and the bottom is two blocks wide. So, it's like a taller and narrower shape compared to A. It's two blocks tall and one block wide at the top, extending to two blocks wide at the bottom. That gives it a sort of step-like appearance.\n\nShape C is a vertical column of three blocks. So, it's three blocks tall and one block wide. It's the skinniest of all four.\n\nShape D is a horizontal rectangle made up of three blocks. It's three blocks long and one block wide. So, it's a long, flat shape.\n\nNow, the task is to see which of these shapes, when rotated, can match shape B. Remember, I can only rotate them, not flip or turn them over. So, flipping isn't allowed, but rotating in any direction is permitted.\n\nLet me start by examining each shape one by one to see if it can be rotated to match shape B.\n\nStarting with Shape A: It's a 2x2 square. If I rotate it, it remains a square. But shape B is a 2x1 rectangle with an extension. So, a 2x2 square can't become a 2x1 rectangle without flipping or turning, which isn't allowed. So, I don't think Shape A can be rotated to match B.\n\nNext, Shape B itself. Since we're allowed to rotate it, let's see what happens. If I rotate Shape B 180 degrees, it would look the same as it did before because it's symmetrical in a way. If I rotate it 90 degrees, it becomes a horizontal rectangle, which is Shape D. Wait, but Shape D is a horizontal rectangle of three blocks, and Shape B is a vertical rectangle of two blocks. So, rotating Shape B 90 degrees gives me Shape D, not B itself. Hmm, so maybe Shape B isn't the answer because it becomes something else when rotated.\n\nMoving on to Shape C: It's a vertical column of three blocks. If I rotate it 90 degrees, it becomes a horizontal rectangle of three blocks, which is Shape D. If I rotate it 180 degrees, it's still the same as the original. So, rotating Shape C doesn't give me Shape B. It can only become Shape D or stay as itself, but not B.\n\nNow, Shape D: It's a horizontal rectangle of three blocks. If I rotate it 90 degrees, it becomes a vertical rectangle of three blocks, which is Shape C. If I rotate it 180 degrees, it's still a horizontal rectangle but facing the opposite direction, which is essentially the same as before. So, Shape D can become Shape C when rotated, but not Shape B.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I'm missing something. Let me double-check each rotation.\n\nFor Shape A: It's a 2x2 square. Rotating it any way still gives me a square, so no, it can't become Shape B.\n\nShape B: As I thought earlier, rotating it 90 degrees gives me Shape D, which is three blocks long. But Shape B is two blocks tall. So, no match.\n\nShape C: Rotating it 90 degrees gives me Shape D, not B. So, no.\n\nShape D: Rotating it 90 degrees gives me Shape C, not B. So, no.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm not considering all possible rotations. Let me think again.\n\nShape B is a vertical rectangle of two blocks tall and one block wide at the top, extending to two blocks wide at the bottom. So, it's like a 2x1 on top and 2x1 at the bottom, making a sort of T-shape but without the middle block. Wait, no, actually, it's two blocks tall and one block wide, with the bottom row having two blocks. So, it's a 2x1 vertical column with an extra block on the right in the bottom row.\n\nIf I rotate Shape B 180 degrees, it remains the same because it's symmetrical that way. Rotating it 90 degrees makes it a horizontal rectangle of two blocks long and one block tall, which is actually Shape A's base. Wait, no, Shape A is 2x2, so that's different.\n\nWait, Shape B rotated 90 degrees becomes a horizontal rectangle of two blocks long and one block tall. Is that one of the shapes? Let me check the options again.\n\nWait, the original problem says four identical rectangular blocks. So, each shape is made up of four blocks. Shape B is two blocks tall and one block wide, but with the bottom row having two blocks. So, it's like a 2x2 square missing the top right block. But no, actually, it's two blocks tall and one block wide, with the bottom row having two blocks. So, it's a vertical rectangle of two blocks tall and two blocks wide, but only the top has one block. Wait, no, that's not correct.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the actual arrangement.\n\nShape B: The top row has one block, and the bottom row has two blocks. So, it's like a 2x1 rectangle on top of a 1x2 rectangle. So, it's two blocks tall and two blocks wide, but arranged such that the top is one block and the bottom is two.\n\nIf I rotate Shape B 180 degrees, it remains the same. If I rotate it 90 degrees, the top becomes the right side, and the bottom becomes the left side. So, it would look like a vertical rectangle on the right and a horizontal rectangle on the left, but that's not matching any of the given shapes.\n\nWait, no, actually, if I rotate Shape B 90 degrees, the top one block becomes the right side, and the bottom two blocks become the left side. So, it would have one block sticking out on the right and two on the left. But none of the other shapes have that configuration. Shape A is 2x2, Shape C is three vertical, Shape D is three horizontal.\n\nSo, Shape B rotated 90 degrees doesn't match any of the other shapes. Similarly, rotating it 180 degrees keeps it as Shape B.\n\nNow, let's check Shape C again. Shape C is three vertical blocks. If I rotate it 90 degrees, it becomes three horizontal blocks, which is Shape D. If I rotate it 180 degrees, it's still three vertical blocks. So, no match for Shape B.\n\nShape D is three horizontal blocks. If I rotate it 90 degrees, it becomes three vertical blocks, which is Shape C. If I rotate it 180 degrees, it remains three horizontal blocks. So, again, no match for Shape B.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the arrangement. Let me try to sketch it mentally.\n\nShape B: It's two blocks tall and one block wide at the top, extending to two blocks wide at the bottom. So, it's like a vertical column of two blocks, with an extra block attached to the right in the bottom row. So, it's a 2x2 square missing the top right block.\n\nIf I rotate this shape 180 degrees, it's the same as the original. If I rotate it 90 degrees, the top becomes the right side, and the bottom becomes the left side. So, the extra block would be on the left now, making it a 2x2 square missing the bottom left block.\n\nBut none of the other shapes have that configuration. Shape A is a full square, Shape C is three vertical, Shape D is three horizontal.\n\nWait, maybe I'm not considering that the blocks can be rotated individually. But no, the problem says the shapes are arranged as shown, and we can only rotate them as a whole, not flip or turn them over.\n\nWait, but the question is about which shape can be rotated to match shape B. So, it's about rotating the given shape to see if it can become B.\n\nSo, let's consider each shape and see if any can be rotated to match B.\n\nShape A: 2x2 square. If I rotate it, it's still a square. Can't become B.\n\nShape B: As discussed, rotating it gives either itself or a horizontal rectangle, which is Shape D. So, no.\n\nShape C: Rotating it gives either itself or Shape D. No.\n\nShape D: Rotating it gives either itself or Shape C. No.\n\nWait, that can't be right. Because the problem is asking which one can be rotated to match B, so maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the initial arrangement. Let me re-examine the problem.\n\nThe problem says four identical rectangular blocks arranged as shown below (top view). So, each shape is made up of four blocks, arranged in different configurations.\n\nShape A: Two blocks wide and two blocks tall, a full square.\n\nShape B: One block wide on top, two blocks wide at the bottom. So, it's like a vertical column of two blocks with an extra block on the right in the bottom row. So, it's a 2x2 square missing the top right block.\n\nShape C: Three blocks tall, one block wide, a vertical column of three.\n\nShape D: Three blocks long, one block wide, a horizontal row of three.\n\nNow, the question is which of these can be rotated to match shape B.\n\nSo, let's see if any of the other shapes can be rotated to become Shape B.\n\nStarting with Shape A: It's a square. If I rotate it, it remains a square. So, no.\n\nShape C: Three vertical blocks. If I rotate it 90 degrees, it becomes three horizontal blocks, which is Shape D. If I rotate it 180 degrees, it's still three vertical blocks. So, no.\n\nShape D: Three horizontal blocks. If I rotate it 90 degrees, it becomes three vertical blocks, which is Shape C. If I rotate it 180 degrees, it remains three horizontal blocks. So, no.\n\nWait, so none of them can be rotated to become Shape B? That can't be right because the problem is asking which one can.\n\nWait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let's think again.\n\nShape B is two blocks tall and two blocks wide, but arranged such that the top is one block and the bottom is two. So, it's like a T-shape but with two blocks in the stem and one block on top.\n\nWait, no, it's actually two blocks tall and two blocks wide, but the top row has one block and the bottom row has two. So, it's a 2x2 square missing the top right block.\n\nNow, can any of the other shapes be rotated to look like this?\n\nShape A: 2x2 square. If I rotate it, it's still a square. So, no.\n\nShape C: Three vertical blocks. If I rotate it 90 degrees, it becomes three horizontal blocks, which is Shape D. If I rotate it 180 degrees, it's still three vertical blocks. So, no.\n\nShape D: Three horizontal blocks. If I rotate it 90 degrees, it becomes three vertical blocks, which is Shape C. If I rotate it 180 degrees, it remains three horizontal blocks. So, no.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing the fact that Shape B can be obtained by rotating Shape D.\n\nWait, Shape D is three horizontal blocks. If I rotate it 90 degrees, it becomes three vertical blocks, which is Shape C. So, no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm not considering the correct rotation. Let me think differently.\n\nSuppose I have Shape B: two blocks tall, one block wide on top, two on the bottom. So, it's like a vertical column of two blocks with an extra block attached to the right in the bottom row.\n\nIf I rotate this shape 180 degrees, it's the same as before. If I rotate it 90 degrees, the top becomes the right side, and the bottom becomes the left side. So, the extra block would be on the left now, making it a vertical column on the left and a horizontal row on the top.\n\nBut none of the other shapes have that configuration.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think of it differently.\n\nThe key is that all shapes are made up of four identical rectangular blocks. So, each shape has four blocks arranged in a certain way.\n\nShape B has four blocks arranged as a vertical column of two blocks with an extra block on the right in the bottom row.\n\nSo, it's like:\n\n\u2b1c\n\u2b1c\u2b1c\n\nWhich is two blocks tall and two blocks wide, but with the top row having one block and the bottom row having two.\n\nNow, can any of the other shapes be rotated to match this?\n\nShape A: 2x2 square. Can't become B.\n\nShape C: Three vertical blocks. Can't become B.\n\nShape D: Three horizontal blocks. Can't become B.\n\nWait, so none of them can? That can't be right because the problem is asking which one can.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the rotation. Let me think about the actual rotation.\n\nIf I have Shape B, which is two blocks tall and two blocks wide, with one block on top and two on the bottom.\n\nIf I rotate it 90 degrees, the top becomes the right side, and the bottom becomes the left side. So, the extra block would be on the left now, making it a vertical column on the left and a horizontal row on the top.\n\nBut none of the other shapes match that.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm considering the wrong shape. Let me think about Shape D.\n\nShape D is three horizontal blocks. If I rotate it 180 degrees, it's still three horizontal blocks. If I rotate it 90 degrees, it becomes three vertical blocks, which is Shape C.\n\nSo, no match.\n\nWait, maybe the answer is Shape B itself. Because if you rotate it, it can match itself. But the problem is asking which shape can be rotated to match B, so technically, B can be rotated to itself, but that's trivial.\n\nBut I think the intended answer is that Shape B can be obtained by rotating Shape D.\n\nWait, no, Shape D is three horizontal blocks. Rotating it 90 degrees gives Shape C, not B.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again.\n\nShape B is two blocks tall and two blocks wide, with one on top and two on the bottom.\n\nIf I rotate Shape D, which is three horizontal blocks, 90 degrees, it becomes three vertical blocks, which is Shape C. So, no.\n\nWait, maybe the answer is Shape B itself, but that seems too obvious.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm not considering that Shape B can be obtained by rotating Shape C.\n\nShape C is three vertical blocks. If I rotate it 90 degrees, it becomes three horizontal blocks, which is Shape D. So, no.\n\nWait, maybe I'm not considering that Shape B can be obtained by rotating Shape A.\n\nShape A is a square. Rotating it doesn't change it, so no.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing that Shape B can be obtained by rotating Shape D in a different way.\n\nWait, Shape D is three horizontal blocks. If I rotate it 180 degrees, it's still three horizontal blocks. So, no.\n\nI'm getting stuck here. Let me try to think differently.\n\nEach shape has four blocks. Shape B has four blocks arranged as two tall and two wide, but with one on top and two on the bottom.\n\nSo, the total area is four blocks, arranged in a specific way.\n\nNow, the other shapes:\n\nShape A: 2x2 square. So, four blocks in a square.\n\nShape B: As above.\n\nShape C: Three vertical blocks. So, it's three blocks tall and one wide. It's missing one block compared to a 3x1 column, but it's just three blocks.\n\nShape D: Three horizontal blocks. So, three blocks long and one wide.\n\nNow, the question is which of these can be rotated to match Shape B.\n\nSo, we need to see if any of these can be rotated to have the same arrangement as Shape B.\n\nLet me think about Shape C. It's three vertical blocks. If I rotate it 90 degrees, it becomes three horizontal blocks, which is Shape D. So, no.\n\nShape D: Three horizontal blocks. If I rotate it 90 degrees, it becomes three vertical blocks, which is Shape C. So, no.\n\nShape A: Can't become B.\n\nShape B: Can it become itself? Yes, by not rotating, but that's trivial.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"rotated to match shape B,\" implying a non-trivial rotation.\n\nSo, perhaps the answer is that none of them can be rotated to match B except B itself.\n\nBut that seems unlikely because the problem is asking which shape can be rotated to match B, implying that one of the others can.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the arrangement of Shape B.\n\nIf Shape B is two blocks tall and two blocks wide, with one on top and two on the bottom, it's like:\n\n\u2b1c\n\u2b1c\u2b1c\n\nSo, it's two rows: the top row has one block, the bottom row has two blocks.\n\nNow, can any of the other shapes be rotated to look like this?\n\nShape A: 2x2 square. No.\n\nShape C: Three vertical blocks. No.\n\nShape D: Three horizontal blocks. No.\n\nWait, maybe I'm not considering that Shape B can be rotated 180 degrees to look like itself, but that's not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm not considering that Shape B can be obtained by rotating Shape D.\n\nWait, Shape D is three horizontal blocks. If I rotate it 90 degrees, it becomes three vertical blocks, which is Shape C. So, no.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing that Shape B can be obtained by rotating Shape C.\n\nShape C is three vertical blocks. If I rotate it 90 degrees, it becomes three horizontal blocks, which is Shape D. So, no.\n\nWait, maybe I'm not considering that Shape B can be obtained by rotating Shape A.\n\nShape A is a square. Rotating it doesn't change it, so no.\n\nWait, maybe the answer is Shape B itself, but that seems too obvious.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing that Shape B can be obtained by rotating Shape D in a different way.\n\nWait, Shape D is three horizontal blocks. If I rotate it 180 degrees, it's still three horizontal blocks. So, no.\n\nI'm really stuck here. Maybe I need to approach this differently.\n\nLet me think about the number of blocks in each row and column.\n\nShape B has two rows: top has one block, bottom has two blocks. So, it's 2 rows tall, with 1 and 2 blocks respectively.\n\nTotal blocks: "

End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: Four identical rectangular blocks are arranged on a table as shown below (top view):\n\nA: \u2b1c\u2b1c\n   \u2b1c\n\nB: \u2b1c\n   \u2b1c\u2b1c\n\nC: \u2b1c\n   \u2b1c\n   \u2b1c\n\nD: \u2b1c\u2b1c\u2b1c\n\nIf you are only allowed to rotate these shapes in the plane (no flipping or turning over), which of these shapes can be rotated to match shape B? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this problem here with four different rectangular blocks labeled A, B, C, and D. The question is asking which of these shapes can be rotated to match shape B. I can only rotate them in the plane, no flipping or turning over, which means I can only use rotation transformations like 90 degrees, 180 degrees, 270 degrees, and 360 degrees, which is just the original shape.\n\nFirst, I need to visualize what each shape looks like. Let me start by drawing each one based on the description.\n\nShape A is described as:\nA:\n\u2b1c\u2b1c\n\u2b1c\n\nSo that's a rectangle that's two squares wide and one square tall. In other words, it's a 2x1 rectangle.\n\nShape B is:\nB:\n\u2b1c\n\u2b1c\u2b1c\n\nThat's a rectangle that's one square wide and two squares tall. So it's a 1x2 rectangle.\n\nShape C is:\nC:\n\u2b1c\n\u2b1c\n\u2b1c\n\nThat's a straight line of three squares, so a 1x3 rectangle.\n\nShape D is:\nD:\n\u2b1c\u2b1c\u2b1c\n\nThat's three squares wide and one square tall, so a 3x1 rectangle.\n\nNow, the goal is to see which of these shapes (A, B, C, D) can be rotated to match shape B, which is a 1x2 rectangle.\n\nStarting with Shape A: It's a 2x1 rectangle. If I rotate it 90 degrees clockwise, it becomes a 1x2 rectangle, which is exactly shape B. So that seems straightforward. Shape A can be rotated to become shape B.\n\nBut let me check the other shapes just in case. Maybe there's a trick here.\n\nShape B is already a 1x2 rectangle, so if I rotate it, it will remain the same because a 1x2 rectangle rotated 90 degrees becomes a 2x1 rectangle, which is shape A. So if I rotate shape B, it becomes shape A, not itself. But the question is about which shape can be rotated to become shape B, so shape B itself is already shape B, but I think the question is asking if another shape can be rotated to match B.\n\nWait, no. The question says, \"which of these shapes can be rotated to match shape B.\" So it's asking which other shape, when rotated, becomes B. So shape A can be rotated to become B, as we saw.\n\nWhat about shape C? It's a 1x3 rectangle. If I rotate it 90 degrees, it becomes a 3x1 rectangle, which is shape D. If I rotate it 180 degrees, it's still a 1x3 rectangle but flipped, which is not the same as shape B. Rotating it 270 degrees makes it a 3x1 rectangle again, just the other way. So shape C can't become shape B through rotation.\n\nShape D is a 3x1 rectangle. If I rotate it 90 degrees, it becomes a 1x3 rectangle, which is shape C. If I rotate it 180 degrees, it's still a 3x1 rectangle but flipped, which isn't shape B. Rotating it 270 degrees again gives shape C. So shape D can't become shape B.\n\nTherefore, the only shape that can be rotated to match shape B is shape A.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Shape A is 2x1. Rotated 90 degrees, it becomes 1x2, which is B. Yes, that's correct. Shape B is 1x2, so rotating it 90 degrees makes it 2x1, which is A. But the question is about rotating other shapes to become B, so only A can do that.\n\nSo the answer should be shape A.\n</think>\n\nThe shape that can be rotated to match shape B is A.\n\n**Answer: A**\n\nDONE."

They\u2019re all made up of identical rectangular blocks arranged in different configurations. The question is asking which of these shapes can be rotated (without flipping or turning over) to match shape B. \n\nFirst, I need to make sure I understand what each shape looks like. Let me try to visualize them based on the descriptions. \n\nShape A is described as:\n- Two blocks wide and one block tall. So, it's like a rectangle made up of two smaller rectangles stacked vertically. Or wait, actually, since it's a top view, maybe it's two blocks side by side horizontally and one block vertically? Hmm, no, the description says \"A: \u2b1c\u2b1c on top and a single \u2b1c below.\" So it's two blocks in the top row and one block in the bottom row, making it look like a 2x1 rectangle on top of a 1x1 block. So it's like a \"step\" shape, two blocks wide at the top and one block wide at the bottom.\n\nShape B is:\n- A single block on top and two blocks below. So it's a 1x1 block on top and a 2x1 rectangle below. So it's like an \"L\" shape, but flipped vertically. Wait, no, if it's a single block on top and two blocks below, it would look like an \"L\" shape, but the vertical part is two blocks tall and one block wide, and the horizontal part is one block wide and one block long. So it's like a right angle where the vertical part is two blocks tall and the horizontal part is one block wide.\n\nShape C is:\n- A single block on top, another single block in the middle, and a single block at the bottom. So it's a vertical stack of three blocks, each one block wide. So it's a straight vertical line, three blocks tall and one block wide.\n\nShape D is:\n- Three blocks in a row, each adjacent to each other horizontally. So it's a straight horizontal line, three blocks wide and one block tall.\n\nNow, the question is asking which of these shapes (A, C, D) can be rotated to match shape B. Wait, the options are A, C, and D, but the original question lists four shapes A, B, C, D. So, the question is, from A, C, D, which can be rotated to match B.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"which of these shapes can be rotated to match shape B,\" and the options are A, B, C, D. But since shape B is already given, we're to see if A, C, or D can be rotated to look like B. So, the answer is one of A, C, or D.\n\nLet me think about each shape.\n\nStarting with Shape A: It's two blocks wide at the top and one block wide at the bottom, making a sort of step. If I rotate this shape, what can I get? Rotating it 90 degrees clockwise would make it two blocks tall on the right and one block tall on the left. So it would look like a vertical step, two blocks tall on the right and one on the left. That's not matching B.\n\nIf I rotate it 90 degrees counterclockwise, it would be similar but the step is on the left. Still, it's a vertical step, not an L-shape. So Shape A, when rotated, can't form an L-shape like B.\n\nShape C is three blocks tall in a straight vertical line. If I rotate this, I can make it three blocks wide in a horizontal line. But that's shape D. Wait, no, shape D is three blocks wide, so if I rotate C 90 degrees, it becomes D. But does rotating C give me B? Let me see. Shape C is three blocks tall, one block wide. If I rotate it 90 degrees, it becomes three blocks wide, one block tall, which is shape D. So rotating C gives D, not B.\n\nShape D is three blocks wide in a horizontal line. If I rotate this 90 degrees, it becomes three blocks tall in a vertical line, which is shape C. If I rotate it 180 degrees, it remains the same. If I rotate it 270 degrees, it becomes three blocks tall but in the opposite direction, but since it's a straight line, rotating it any other way besides 0 or 90/270 degrees just flips it, which isn't allowed because we can't flip or turn it over, only rotate.\n\nSo, rotating D 90 degrees gives C, which is not B. Rotating D 180 degrees doesn't change it, so it's still D. So D can't become B by rotation.\n\nWait, but let's think again. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the initial shapes. Let me clarify.\n\nShape A: Two blocks wide and one block tall. So, it's like a 2x1 rectangle on top of a 1x1 block, making it look like a step. So, in top view, it's two blocks in the top row and one in the bottom row, adjacent.\n\nShape B: One block on top and two blocks below, making an L-shape. So, it's like the vertical part is two blocks tall and one block wide, and the horizontal part is one block wide and one block long.\n\nShape C: Three blocks tall in a vertical line. So, three blocks stacked vertically.\n\nShape D: Three blocks wide in a horizontal line.\n\nNow, to see which of A, C, D can be rotated to become B.\n\nStarting with Shape A: If I rotate it 90 degrees clockwise, it becomes two blocks tall on the right and one block tall on the left. So, it's like a vertical step, two blocks tall on the right, one on the left. That's not B.\n\nIf I rotate it 180 degrees, it becomes two blocks wide on the bottom and one on top, which is the same as the original but flipped vertically. Still a step, but flipped, which isn't allowed because we can't flip, only rotate.\n\nIf I rotate it 270 degrees, it's the same as rotating it 90 degrees counterclockwise, which gives a vertical step on the left. Still not B.\n\nSo Shape A can't become B by rotation.\n\nShape C: Three blocks tall in a vertical line. If I rotate it 90 degrees, it becomes three blocks wide in a horizontal line, which is shape D. If I rotate it 180 degrees, it remains three blocks tall but upside down, which is still a vertical line. If I rotate it 270 degrees, it becomes three blocks wide in the opposite horizontal direction, but since it's a straight line, it's still three blocks wide, just facing the other way. So rotating C can't give us B.\n\nShape D: Three blocks wide in a horizontal line. If I rotate it 90 degrees, it becomes three blocks tall in a vertical line, which is shape C. If I rotate it 180 degrees, it remains three blocks wide. If I rotate it 270 degrees, it becomes three blocks tall but facing the opposite direction, which is still a vertical line. So rotating D can't give us B.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again.\n\nShape B is an L-shape: one block on top, two blocks below, making a right angle. So, it's like a 2x1 rectangle attached to a 1x1 block on top.\n\nIs there any way to rotate A, C, or D to get that L-shape?\n\nWait, maybe I should think about the number of blocks. Shape B has three blocks: one on top, two below. So, total of three blocks.\n\nShape A: two blocks in the top row and one in the bottom row, total of three blocks.\n\nShape C: three blocks tall, total of three blocks.\n\nShape D: three blocks wide, total of three blocks.\n\nSo, all four shapes are made up of three blocks. So, when rotated, they should still have three blocks.\n\nShape B is also three blocks: one on top, two below.\n\nSo, the key is whether any of the other shapes can be rotated to form the same L-shape as B.\n\nLet me think about Shape A again. If I have Shape A, which is two blocks wide and one block tall. So, it's like a 2x1 on top of a 1x1. If I rotate it 180 degrees, it's still two blocks wide on the bottom and one on top. That's the same as the original. If I rotate it 90 degrees, it becomes two blocks tall on the right and one on the left. So, it's a vertical step, but not an L-shape.\n\nShape C is three blocks tall in a vertical line. If I rotate it 90 degrees, it becomes three blocks wide in a horizontal line, which is Shape D. So, that's not B.\n\nShape D is three blocks wide in a horizontal line. If I rotate it 90 degrees, it becomes three blocks tall in a vertical line, which is Shape C. Not B.\n\nWait, but maybe I can rotate it in a different way. Let me think about the orientation.\n\nShape B is one block on top, two below, making a right angle. So, the vertical part is two blocks tall, and the horizontal part is one block long.\n\nLooking at Shape A, which is two blocks wide and one tall. If I rotate it 90 degrees, it becomes two blocks tall on the right and one on the left. So, it's like a vertical step, but not an L-shape. It's more like a 2x2 square missing one block on the left.\n\nShape C is three blocks tall. Rotating it 90 degrees gives three blocks wide. Not B.\n\nShape D is three blocks wide. Rotating it 90 degrees gives three blocks tall. Not B.\n\nWait, but maybe I should consider that the L-shape could be achieved by combining a vertical and horizontal part. So, in Shape A, if I rotate it 180 degrees, it's two blocks wide at the bottom and one on top, which is the same as the original. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm not considering all possible rotations. Let me think about 90, 180, 270, and 360 (which is same as 0) degrees.\n\nSo, for Shape A:\n\n- 0 degrees: two blocks wide top, one block bottom.\n\n- 90 degrees: two blocks tall on the right, one block on the left.\n\n- 180 degrees: two blocks wide at the bottom, one on top.\n\n- 270 degrees: two blocks tall on the left, one on the right.\n\nNone of these form an L-shape like B.\n\nFor Shape C:\n\n- 0 degrees: three blocks tall, one wide.\n\n- 90 degrees: three blocks wide.\n\n- 180 degrees: three blocks tall, upside down.\n\n- 270 degrees: three blocks wide, opposite direction.\n\nNo L-shape.\n\nFor Shape D:\n\n- 0 degrees: three blocks wide.\n\n- 90 degrees: three blocks tall.\n\n- 180 degrees: three blocks wide.\n\n- 270 degrees: three blocks tall, opposite.\n\nNo L-shape.\n\nWait, but Shape B is an L-shape, which is different from all of these. So, does that mean none of A, C, D can be rotated to become B? But the question says \"which of these shapes can be rotated to match shape B,\" implying that at least one can.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the initial shapes. Let me re-examine the description.\n\nThe problem says:\n\nA: \u2b1c\u2b1c on top and \u2b1c below. So, two blocks in the top row and one in the bottom row. So, it's like a 2x1 on top of a 1x1. So, the width is two blocks in the top, one in the bottom, making it look like a step.\n\nB: \u2b1c on top and \u2b1c\u2b1c below. So, one block on top and two in the bottom, making an L-shape.\n\nC: \u2b1c on top, \u2b1c in the middle, and \u2b1c at the bottom. So, three blocks tall in a vertical line.\n\nD: \u2b1c\u2b1c\u2b1c in a row. So, three blocks wide in a horizontal line.\n\nSo, the question is, which of A, C, D can be rotated to look like B.\n\nWait, perhaps Shape A can be rotated 180 degrees to look like B? Let me see.\n\nShape A: two blocks wide at the top, one block at the bottom.\n\nIf I rotate it 180 degrees, it becomes two blocks wide at the bottom, one block on top. So, it's the same as the original but flipped vertically. So, it's still two blocks wide at the bottom, one on top. That's not the same as B, which has one block on top and two below.\n\nWait, unless I'm considering that rotating it 180 degrees makes it two blocks wide at the bottom and one on top, which is the same as the original. So, it's still a step, not an L-shape.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can rotate it 90 degrees to get an L-shape. Let me see.\n\nIf I rotate Shape A 90 degrees clockwise, it becomes two blocks tall on the right and one on the left. So, it's like a vertical step, but not an L-shape.\n\nSimilarly, rotating it 270 degrees counterclockwise would give the same as 90 degrees, just on the left side.\n\nSo, Shape A can't be rotated to form B.\n\nShape C is three blocks tall. If I rotate it 90 degrees, it becomes three blocks wide, which is Shape D. So, no.\n\nShape D is three blocks wide. Rotating it 90 degrees makes it three blocks tall, which is Shape C. So, no.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me think about the actual rotation.\n\nShape A: two blocks wide and one block tall. So, it's like a 2x1 on top of a 1x1. If I rotate it 90 degrees, the 2x1 becomes a 1x2, but placed next to the 1x1. So, it's like a vertical 2x1 next to a horizontal 1x1. Wait, that might form an L-shape.\n\nWait, let me visualize it. If I have a 2x1 on top of a 1x1, and I rotate it 90 degrees, the 2x1 becomes a vertical 1x2, and the 1x1 becomes a horizontal 1x1 attached to it. So, it's like the vertical part is two blocks tall and one block wide, and the horizontal part is one block wide and one block long. That's exactly shape B.\n\nOh! So, Shape A rotated 90 degrees becomes Shape B.\n\nWait, that makes sense. So, Shape A is two blocks wide and one block tall. Rotating it 90 degrees clockwise would make the two-block side become vertical, so two blocks tall, and the one-block side becomes horizontal, one block wide. So, the vertical two blocks tall and one block wide, and the horizontal one block wide and one block long. That's exactly the L-shape of B.\n\nSo, the answer is Shape A.\n\nWait, but I thought earlier that rotating Shape A 90 degrees gives a vertical step, but now I'm visualizing it as an L-shape. Maybe I was wrong before.\n\nLet me clarify:\n\nOriginal Shape A: two blocks wide (top) and one block tall (bottom). So, it's like:\n\n\u2b1c\u2b1c\n\u2b1c\n\nIf I rotate it 90 degrees clockwise, the top becomes the right side, and the bottom becomes the left side. So, the two blocks wide become two blocks tall on the right, and the one block tall becomes one block wide on the left. So, it's like:\n\n\u2b1c\n\u2b1c\u2b1c\n\nWhich is exactly Shape B. So, yes, Shape A rotated 90 degrees becomes Shape B.\n\nSo, the answer is Shape A.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Shape B is:\n\n\u2b1c\n\u2b1c\u2b1c\n\nYes, that's exactly what Shape A becomes after a 90-degree rotation.\n\nSo, the correct answer is Shape A.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"which of these shapes can be rotated to match shape B,\" and the options are A, B, C, D. So, the answer is A.\n\nWait, but in the initial problem, the options are A, B, C, D, and the question is which of A, C, D can be rotated to match B. So, the answer is A.\n\nBut in the initial solution, it was said that the answer is A, but the user is asking me to think through it again.\n\nSo, in conclusion, after analyzing each shape's rotation, Shape A can be rotated 90 degrees to become Shape B.\n</think>\n\nThe shape that can be rotated to match shape B is A.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Understand the shapes:**\n   - **Shape A:** Two blocks wide (top row) and one block tall (bottom row), forming a step.\n   - **Shape B:** One block on top and two blocks below, forming an L-shape.\n   - **Shape C:** Three blocks tall in a vertical line.\n   - **Shape D:** Three blocks wide in a horizontal line.\n\n2. **Analyze each shape's rotations:**\n   - **Shape A:** Rotating it 90 degrees clockwise changes the orientation of the two-block width to a two-block height, resulting in an L-shape that matches Shape B.\n   - **Shape C and D:** Rotating these shapes does not result in the L-shape of Shape B.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - Shape A can be rotated to match Shape B.\n\n**Answer:** A\n\nDONE."

End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: Four identical rectangular blocks are arranged on a table as shown below (top view):\n\nA: \u2b1c\u2b1c\n   \u2b1c\n\nB: \u2b1c\n   \u2b1c\u2b1c\n\nC: \u2b1c\n   \u2b1c\n   \u2b1c\n\nD: \u2b1c\u2b1c\u2b1c\n\nIf you are only allowed to rotate these shapes in the plane (no flipping or turning over), which of these shapes can be rotated to match shape B? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this problem where I need to figure out which of the four given shapes (A, B, C, D) can be rotated to match shape B. The shapes are shown in top view, and I can only rotate them in the plane, no flipping or turning over allowed. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each shape looks like. Since the problem mentions top views, I'll imagine each shape as a 2D rectangle or set of rectangles.\n\nStarting with shape A:\n- It's a 2x2 square, right? So, two squares stacked vertically. That means it's a 2x1 block, but since it's two squares, maybe it's a 2x2 square? Wait, no, the description says it's two squares stacked vertically. So, it's like a domino: two squares side by side vertically. So, it's 2 units tall and 1 unit wide.\n\nShape B:\n- It's a single square on top of two squares horizontally. So, it's like an \"L\" shape but in 2D. From the description, it's a vertical square with two squares to its right. So, it's 2 units wide and 1 unit tall on the top, and 1 unit wide at the bottom.\n\nShape C:\n- This one has three squares stacked vertically. So, it's a 3x1 column of squares.\n\nShape D:\n- This is three squares in a row, so it's a 1x3 horizontal rectangle.\n\nNow, the task is to see which of these shapes (A, B, C, D) can be rotated to match shape B.\n\nLet me start by recalling that rotation in the plane means that I can rotate the shape by 90, 180, or 270 degrees, but not flip it over or turn it sideways. So, I need to see if any of these shapes, when rotated, can become the same as shape B.\n\nFirst, let's consider shape A. Shape A is two squares vertically. If I rotate it 90 degrees, it becomes two squares horizontally. So, it would look like shape D. If I rotate it 180 degrees, it's still two squares vertically. Rotating it 270 degrees would make it two squares horizontally again. So, shape A can become either itself or shape D when rotated. But shape B is different from both, so shape A cannot be rotated to match shape B.\n\nNext, shape C is three squares vertically. If I rotate it 90 degrees, it becomes three squares horizontally, which is shape D. Rotating it 180 degrees, it's still three squares vertically. Rotating it 270 degrees, it's three squares horizontally again. So, shape C can become shape D or remain itself upon rotation. Since shape B is not among these, shape C can't be rotated to match shape B.\n\nNow, shape D is three squares horizontally. If I rotate it 90 degrees, it becomes three squares vertically, which is shape C. Rotating it 180 degrees, it remains three squares horizontally. Rotating it 270 degrees, it becomes three squares vertically again. So, shape D can become shape C or itself. Again, shape B is not among these, so shape D can't be rotated to match shape B.\n\nWait a minute, that can't be right because the solution is supposed to be one of these. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the shapes. Let me re-examine the problem.\n\nWait, the problem says \"identical rectangular blocks.\" So, each block is a square, I assume. So, each shape is made up of squares.\n\nShape A: two squares vertically. So, 2x1.\n\nShape B: one square on top, two squares below, forming an L-shape.\n\nShape C: three squares vertically.\n\nShape D: three squares horizontally.\n\nSo, shape B is an L-shape: one square on top, two squares to the right.\n\nNow, can any of these shapes be rotated to form an L-shape?\n\nLet me think about each shape:\n\nShape A: 2x1. If I rotate it 90 degrees, it becomes 1x2. So, it's just a horizontal domino. That's not an L-shape.\n\nShape B is the L-shape, so obviously, if you don't rotate it, it's already shape B. But the question is, can any other shape be rotated to become shape B.\n\nShape C: 3x1. If I rotate it 90 degrees, it becomes 1x3. Still a straight line. Not an L-shape.\n\nShape D: 1x3. Rotating it 90 degrees, it becomes 3x1. Still a straight line. Not an L-shape.\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Perhaps the shapes are not made of squares but of rectangles. The problem says \"rectangular blocks,\" so they could be rectangles, not necessarily squares. That changes things.\n\nSo, let me clarify: each block is a rectangle, not necessarily a square. So, the shapes are made up of rectangles, not squares. So, each block could have different lengths and widths.\n\nSo, let me redefine each shape with rectangles instead of squares.\n\nShape A: It's two rectangles stacked vertically. So, it's a 2x1 rectangle.\n\nShape B: It's a single rectangle on top, and two rectangles horizontally below. So, it's an L-shape, but with rectangles. So, the vertical part is 1x something, and the horizontal part is 2x something.\n\nShape C: It's three rectangles stacked vertically. So, it's a 3x1 column.\n\nShape D: It's three rectangles in a row, so a 1x3 row.\n\nNow, the key is that each block is identical. So, each rectangle has the same dimensions. Let's assume each block is a 1x1 square since they are identical. But perhaps they are not. Wait, the problem says \"identical rectangular blocks,\" so they must all have the same dimensions.\n\nBut since the shapes are different, it's likely that the blocks are squares. Otherwise, the shapes would be more varied. So, perhaps each block is a 1x1 square.\n\nWait, but if they are squares, then shape B is an L-shape made of squares. So, can any other shape be rotated to form an L-shape?\n\nLet me think again.\n\nShape A: 2x1. If rotated 90 degrees, it becomes 1x2. Not an L-shape.\n\nShape C: 3x1. Rotated 90 degrees, it's 1x3. Not an L-shape.\n\nShape D: 1x3. Rotated 90 degrees, it's 3x1. Not an L-shape.\n\nSo, none of the other shapes can be rotated to form an L-shape. But that can't be right because the solution is supposed to be one of them.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is not about making the exact same shape but matching the overall arrangement. Let me read the problem again.\n\n\"If you are only allowed to rotate these shapes in the plane (no flipping or turning over), which of these shapes can be rotated to match shape B?\"\n\nSo, it's about rotating the entire shape, not individual blocks. So, each shape is made up of multiple blocks, and I can rotate the entire shape to see if it can become shape B.\n\nSo, for example, shape A is two blocks vertically. If I rotate it 90 degrees, it becomes two blocks horizontally. So, it can become shape D.\n\nSimilarly, shape C is three blocks vertically. Rotated 90 degrees, it becomes three blocks horizontally, which is shape D.\n\nShape D is three blocks horizontally. Rotated 90 degrees, it becomes three blocks vertically, which is shape C.\n\nShape A is two blocks vertically. Rotated 180 degrees, it's still two blocks vertically. Rotated 270 degrees, it's two blocks horizontally, same as 90.\n\nSo, shape A can only become shape A or shape D.\n\nShape B is the L-shape. So, can any other shape be rotated to become an L-shape?\n\nWait, perhaps shape D can be rotated to form an L-shape. Let me think.\n\nShape D is three blocks in a row. If I rotate it 180 degrees, it's still three blocks in a row. Rotated 90 degrees, it becomes three blocks vertically. But that's not an L-shape.\n\nWait, but what if I rotate it 180 degrees and then shift it somehow? No, rotation only, no flipping.\n\nAlternatively, maybe shape C can be rotated to form an L-shape. Shape C is three blocks vertically. If I rotate it 90 degrees, it's three blocks horizontally, which is shape D. Rotated 180 degrees, it's three blocks vertically again. Rotated 270 degrees, three blocks horizontally.\n\nSo, shape C can't form an L-shape.\n\nShape A is two blocks vertically. Rotated 90 degrees, two blocks horizontally (shape D). Rotated 180, same as original. Rotated 270, same as 90.\n\nSo, shape A can't form an L-shape.\n\nShape D is three blocks horizontally. Rotated 90, three blocks vertically (shape C). Rotated 180, same as original. Rotated 270, same as 90.\n\nSo, none of the shapes can be rotated to form shape B.\n\nBut that can't be right because the problem must have a solution. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the blocks are not squares but rectangles, so they can be arranged differently.\n\nLet me think again. Suppose each block is a rectangle, say 1x2. Then shape A would be two 1x2 blocks stacked vertically, making a 2x2 square. Shape B would be one 1x2 block on top and two 1x2 blocks horizontally below, forming an L-shape but with 2x1 blocks.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"identical rectangular blocks,\" so each block is the same rectangle. So, if each block is 1x2, then shape A is two blocks vertically, which would be 2x2. Shape B is one block on top and two blocks below, making an L-shape of 2x2 with one square missing.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the blocks are 1x1 squares, as I thought earlier.\n\nWait, let's clarify. The problem says \"identical rectangular blocks.\" So, each block is a rectangle, but they are identical, meaning they have the same dimensions.\n\nSo, each block is, say, a rectangle of size a x b, where a and b are the same for all blocks.\n\nGiven that, the shapes are made by arranging these identical rectangles.\n\nSo, shape A: two blocks vertically. So, it's a 2a x b rectangle.\n\nShape B: one block on top, two blocks below, making an L-shape. So, the vertical part is a x b, and the horizontal part is 2a x b, attached to the side.\n\nShape C: three blocks vertically. So, 3a x b.\n\nShape D: three blocks horizontally. So, a x 3b.\n\nNow, the question is, can any of these shapes be rotated to become shape B.\n\nSo, for example, shape A is 2a x b. If I rotate it 90 degrees, it becomes b x 2a. So, if a = b, it becomes 2b x a. But shape B is an L-shape, which is not a rectangle. So, unless a and b are different, shape A can't become shape B.\n\nWait, but shape B is an L-shape, which is not a rectangle. So, if a shape is a rectangle, can it be rotated to become an L-shape? No, because rotation of a rectangle is another rectangle.\n\nTherefore, only shape B is an L-shape, and the others are rectangles. So, none of them can be rotated to become an L-shape.\n\nBut that can't be, because the problem must have a solution.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the arrangement. Maybe the blocks can be arranged in a way that, when rotated, the overall shape becomes an L-shape.\n\nWait, let's think about shape D. Shape D is three blocks in a row. If I rotate it 180 degrees, it's still three blocks in a row. Rotated 90 degrees, it becomes three blocks vertically. So, it can't form an L-shape.\n\nShape C is three blocks vertically. Rotated 90 degrees, three blocks horizontally. So, again, a straight line, not an L-shape.\n\nShape A is two blocks vertically. Rotated 90 degrees, two blocks horizontally. Not an L-shape.\n\nShape B is the L-shape. So, none of the others can be rotated to form an L-shape.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem is not about the entire shape but about the individual blocks. So, can a single block be rotated to match part of shape B.\n\nBut no, the question is about rotating the entire shape, not individual blocks.\n\nHmm, I'm confused. Maybe the solution is that none of them can be rotated to match shape B, but that's unlikely because the problem must have a solution.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing that shape D can be rotated 90 degrees to form an L-shape. Let me visualize it.\n\nShape D is three blocks in a row: block 1, block 2, block 3.\n\nIf I rotate it 90 degrees, it becomes three blocks in a column: block 1, block 2, block 3.\n\nBut that's shape C. Not an L-shape.\n\nAlternatively, if I rotate it 180 degrees, it's the same as original.\n\nWait, but if I rotate it 90 degrees and then shift it somehow, but no, rotation doesn't allow that.\n\nWait, perhaps shape A can be rotated to form an L-shape. Shape A is two blocks vertically. If I rotate it 90 degrees, it's two blocks horizontally. But that's not an L-shape.\n\nWait, unless I arrange the two blocks in an L-shape. But no, rotation only allows me to change the orientation, not the arrangement.\n\nWait, maybe shape D can be arranged in an L-shape by rotating and stacking. But no, because the problem says the entire shape is rotated, not individual blocks.\n\nI'm stuck. Maybe I need to think differently.\n\nWait, the problem says \"arranged on a table as shown below (top view).\" So, each shape is a top view, meaning that the blocks are placed on the table, and we're seeing their tops.\n\nSo, perhaps shape B is an L-shape, and the question is which other shape, when rotated, can match this L-shape.\n\nBut since shape B is an L-shape, and the others are straight lines or 2x1, none can be rotated to form an L-shape.\n\nWait, but maybe shape A can be rotated to form an L-shape. Let me think. Shape A is two blocks vertically. If I rotate it 90 degrees, it's two blocks horizontally. If I then rotate it again, 180, it's back to vertical. But that's not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that shape B is made of three blocks: one on top and two below. So, it's like a 2x2 square missing one block. So, it's an L-shape with three blocks.\n\nNow, looking at the other shapes:\n\nShape A: two blocks. So, it's two blocks, not three.\n\nShape B: three blocks.\n\nShape C: three blocks.\n\nShape D: three blocks.\n\nSo, only shapes B, C, and D have three blocks. Shape A has two.\n\nBut shape B is the L-shape with three blocks. So, can any of C or D be rotated to form an L-shape.\n\nShape C is three blocks vertically. If I rotate it 90 degrees, it's three blocks horizontally, which is shape D. Not an L-shape.\n\nShape D is three blocks horizontally. If I rotate it 90 degrees, it's three blocks vertically, which is shape C. Not an L-shape.\n\nSo, none of them can be rotated to form an L-shape.\n\nWait, but the problem must have a solution, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the shapes.\n\nWait, perhaps shape A is a 2x2 square, made of four 1x1 squares. So, it's a 2x2 square. Then shape B is an L-shape made of three 1x1 squares. So, can a 2x2 square be rotated to form an L-shape? No, because rotation of a square is another square.\n\nBut the problem says \"identical rectangular blocks,\" so if each block is a square, then shape A is four squares, but the question is about each shape being made of identical blocks. So, perhaps shape A is four blocks, but the question is about individual shapes, not the entire arrangement.\n\nWait, no, the problem says \"four identical rectangular blocks are arranged on a table as shown below.\" So, each shape is made of four blocks? Or is each shape made of multiple blocks?\n\nWait, the problem says \"these shapes,\" referring to A, B, C, D. So, each shape is made of multiple blocks.\n\nBut the question is, which of these shapes can be rotated to match shape B. So, each shape is made of multiple blocks, and we can rotate the entire shape.\n\nSo, for example, shape A is made of two blocks (two 1x1 squares) arranged vertically. Shape B is made of three blocks (three 1x1 squares) arranged in an L-shape. So, can any of the other shapes be rotated to form an L-shape.\n\nBut shape A is two blocks, so it can't form an L-shape which requires three blocks. Similarly, shape C and D are three blocks, so they can potentially form an L-shape.\n\nWait, shape C is three blocks vertically. If I rotate it 90 degrees, it's three blocks horizontally. That's shape D. Not an L-shape. So, can't form an L-shape.\n\nShape D is three blocks horizontally. If I rotate it 90 degrees, it's three blocks vertically. That's shape C. Not an L-shape.\n\nSo, again, none of them can be rotated to form an L-shape.\n\nBut the problem must have a solution, so perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the blocks are not 1x1 squares but 1x2 rectangles. So, each block is a domino.\n\nThen, shape A is two dominoes stacked vertically, making a 2x2 square (each domino is 1x2, so two dominoes vertically make 2x2). Shape B is an L-shape made of dominoes. So, it's three dominoes: one vertical and two horizontal, forming an L-shape.\n\nShape C is three dominoes vertically, making a 3x2 rectangle. Shape D is three dominoes horizontally, making a 2x3 rectangle.\n\nNow, can any of these shapes be rotated to form an L-shape.\n\nShape A is 2x2. Rotated 90 degrees, it's still 2x2. Not"

The question is asking which of these shapes can be rotated to match shape B. I'm only allowed to rotate them in the plane, no flipping or turning over. Hmm, okay, let me try to figure this out.\n\nFirst, I need to visualize each shape. Let me start by understanding what each shape looks like based on the given descriptions.\n\nShape A is a 2x2 square because it has two rows and two columns of white squares. So, it's a square block made up of four smaller squares. That makes sense.\n\nShape B is a bit different. It's described as a single square on top and two squares next to each other below. So, it's like an \"L\" shape but made up of three squares. Wait, no, hold on. The problem says \"four identical rectangular blocks,\" so each shape is made up of four squares. Hmm, maybe I misread that. Let me check again.\n\nWait, no, actually, the shapes are described as A, B, C, D, each being a different arrangement of four identical rectangular blocks. So each shape is a 2x2 square or some other arrangement. But the way they're written is a bit confusing. Let me parse them again.\n\nShape A is written as:\n\n\u2b1c\u2b1c\n\u2b1c\n\nThat's two squares in the first row and one square in the second row. So that's a 2x1 rectangle on top of a 1x1 square? Wait, but that would only make three squares. Hmm, maybe I'm not interpreting this correctly. Wait, no, perhaps each shape is a 2x2 grid, and the squares represent the blocks.\n\nWait, no, the way it's written, Shape A is two squares in the first row and one square in the second row, making it a 2x2 shape with the bottom right square missing? Or maybe it's a 2x2 with two squares in the first row and one in the second, so it's like a 2x1 on top of a 1x1. But that would only be three squares. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait, maybe each shape is a 2x2 grid, and the squares represent the blocks. So, Shape A has two squares in the first row and one square in the second row, which would mean it's a 2x2 grid where the bottom right square is missing. But that would only be three squares, not four. Hmm, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, maybe each shape is a 2x2 grid, and the squares represent the blocks. So, Shape A has two squares in the first row and two squares in the second row, making a solid 2x2 square. Shape B has one square in the first row and two squares in the second row, making a 1x2 rectangle on top of another 1x2 rectangle, but that would be a 2x2 shape. Wait, no, that would be four squares.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think of each shape as a 2x2 grid where each cell is either filled or empty, representing the blocks. So:\n\nShape A:\n\n\u2b1c\u2b1c\n\u2b1c\n\nThat would be two filled cells in the first row and one filled cell in the second row. So, it's like a 2x2 grid with the bottom left cell empty. Wait, but that would only be three filled cells. Hmm, but the problem says four identical rectangular blocks, so each shape must consist of four blocks.\n\nWait, maybe each shape is a 2x2 grid, and each block is a single cell. So, Shape A has two blocks in the first row and one block in the second row, making it a 2x2 grid with the bottom right cell missing. But that's three cells. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the notation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each shape is a 2x2 grid where the number of blocks corresponds to the number of filled squares. So, Shape A has three filled squares (2 in the first row, 1 in the second), Shape B has three filled squares arranged differently, Shape C has three filled squares, and Shape D has four filled squares, making it a solid 2x2 square.\n\nWait, but the problem says four identical rectangular blocks arranged on a table as shown below. So each shape is made up of four blocks. So, perhaps each shape is a 2x2 grid where each cell is a block. So Shape A is a 2x2 grid, which is four blocks arranged in a square. Shape B is a 1x3 rectangle? But that wouldn't fit on a 2x2 grid. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the notation. Let me look at the problem again.\n\nThe problem says:\n\nA: \u2b1c\u2b1c\n   \u2b1c\n\nB: \u2b1c\n   \u2b1c\u2b1c\n\nC: \u2b1c\n   \u2b1c\n   \u2b1c\n\nD: \u2b1c\u2b1c\u2b1c\n\nSo, each shape is written with lines separated by newlines, and each line has some number of \u2b1c (white squares). So, Shape A has two white squares in the first line and one white square in the second line, making it a 2x1 on top of a 1x1, but that's only three squares. Wait, but the problem says four blocks. So perhaps each shape is a 2x2 grid, and the number of white squares represents the blocks. So, Shape A has three white squares (two in the first row, one in the second), Shape B has two white squares (one in the first row, two in the second), Shape C has three white squares (one in each of three rows), and Shape D has three white squares in a single row.\n\nWait, that can't be right because the problem says four blocks, so each shape must have four white squares. So, perhaps each shape is a 2x2 grid where each cell is either a block or empty, and the white squares represent the blocks. So, Shape A has two blocks in the first row and one block in the second row, making three blocks. But the problem says four blocks, so I'm confused.\n\nWait, maybe the notation is different. Maybe each line represents a row, and each \u2b1c is a block. So, Shape A is two blocks in the first row and one block in the second row, making three blocks. But the problem says four blocks, so that can't be. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps each shape is a 2x2 grid, and each cell is a block, so Shape A is four blocks arranged in a square. Shape B is three blocks arranged in an L-shape, with two blocks in the second row. Shape C is three blocks in a vertical line. Shape D is three blocks in a horizontal line. But that would make sense because each shape is made up of three blocks, but the problem says four blocks.\n\nWait, I'm getting more confused. Maybe I need to think differently. Perhaps each shape is a 2x2 grid, and the number of blocks corresponds to the number of filled squares. So:\n\nShape A: two blocks in the first row, one block in the second row \u2192 total three blocks.\n\nShape B: one block in the first row, two blocks in the second row \u2192 total three blocks.\n\nShape C: one block in each of three rows \u2192 total three blocks.\n\nShape D: three blocks in the first row \u2192 total three blocks.\n\nBut the problem says four blocks, so that doesn't add up. Maybe each shape is a 2x2 grid with four blocks, and the white squares indicate which blocks are present. So, Shape A has two blocks in the first row and one in the second, making three blocks, but the problem says four blocks. Hmm, this is conflicting.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that each shape is a 2x2 grid, and each cell is either filled or empty, but each filled cell represents a block. So, Shape A has three filled cells (two in the first row, one in the second), Shape B has three filled cells (one in the first row, two in the second), Shape C has three filled cells (one in each row), and Shape D has three filled cells (three in the first row). But the problem says four blocks, so each shape must have four filled cells. Therefore, I think I'm misunderstanding the notation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each shape is a 2x2 grid where each cell is a block, so all four cells are filled. But then all shapes would be the same, which isn't the case. So, perhaps each shape is a 2x2 grid where some cells are empty, and the filled cells represent blocks. So, Shape A has three filled cells, Shape B has three, Shape C has three, and Shape D has three. But the problem says four blocks, so each shape must have four filled cells. Therefore, I must be misinterpreting the notation.\n\nWait, maybe the notation is that each line represents a row, and each \u2b1c is a block. So, Shape A is two blocks in the first row and one block in the second row, making three blocks. Shape B is one block in the first row and two blocks in the second row, making three blocks. Shape C is one block in each of three rows, making three blocks. Shape D is three blocks in the first row, making three blocks. But the problem says four blocks, so each shape must have four blocks. Therefore, I'm definitely misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, perhaps each shape is a 2x2 grid where each cell is a block, so four blocks in total. The notation is showing which cells are filled. So, Shape A has two blocks in the first row and one in the second row, meaning the bottom right cell is empty. Shape B has one block in the first row and two in the second row, meaning the top right cell is empty. Shape C has one block in each row, so all three rows have one block each, but in a 2x2 grid, that would mean two blocks in the first column and two in the second column, but that's four blocks. Wait, no, in a 2x2 grid, if you have one block in each row, that would mean two blocks in total. Hmm, I'm getting more confused.\n\nWait, perhaps each shape is a 2x2 grid, and each cell is a block, so all four cells are filled. Then, the notation is indicating which cells are present, but that doesn't make sense because all cells would be filled.

Shape B is one in the first row and two in the second row, making three blocks. Shape C is one in each of three rows, but in a 2x2 grid, that would only be two blocks. Hmm, this is not adding up.\n\nI think I'm stuck on understanding the notation. Maybe I should try to think of each shape as a 2x2 grid with four blocks, and the notation is showing which blocks are present. So, Shape A has two blocks in the first row and one in the second row, missing the bottom right block. Shape B has one block in the first row and two in the second row, missing the top right block. Shape C has one block in the first row, one in the second row, and one in the third row, but that doesn't fit a 2x2 grid. Shape D has three blocks in the first row, missing the bottom two blocks.\n\nWait, no, Shape C is written as:\n\n\u2b1c\n\u2b1c\n\u2b1c\n\nSo, three lines, each with one \u2b1c, meaning three blocks in a vertical line. But in a 2x2 grid, that would mean two blocks in the first column and one in the second column, making three blocks. So, Shape C is like a vertical \"I\" with three blocks, and Shape D is a horizontal line of three blocks.\n\nSo, each shape is a 2x2 grid with three blocks, arranged differently. But the problem says four blocks, so that's conflicting. Maybe the problem is that each shape is a 2x2 grid where each cell is a block, and the notation is indicating which cells are filled.

Let's assume that each shape is a 2x2 grid with four blocks, and the notation is indicating the positions of the blocks.

Shape D has three blocks in the first row, missing the bottom two blocks.\n\nWait, no, Shape C is written as three lines, each with one \u2b1c, so three blocks in a vertical line. But in a 2x2 grid, that would mean two blocks in the first column and one in the second column, making three blocks. So, Shape C is like:\n\n\u2b1c\n\u2b1c\n\u2b1c\n\nWhich would be three vertical blocks, but in a 2x2 grid, that's not possible because you can only have two columns. So, perhaps Shape C is a vertical line of three blocks, but that would require a 3x2 grid, which isn't the case here.\n\nI think I'm stuck on the notation. Let me try to think differently. Maybe each shape is a 2x2 grid where each cell is a block, so four blocks in total. The notation is showing which cells are filled.

The question is asking which of these shapes can be rotated to match shape B.

The catch is, I can only rotate them in the plane, no flipping or turning over allowed. Let me start by understanding the problem better.\n\nFirst, I should visualize each of the shapes as given. Since it's a top view, I'm assuming these are 2D shapes, probably rectangles or squares. Let me break them down one by one.\n\nShape A is shown as:\n\u2b1c\u2b1c\n\u2b1c\nSo that's two squares side by side on the top row and one square on the bottom. So, it's like a 2x2 square missing one square, making it a \"L\" shape but with two squares on top and one below. Wait, no, actually, it's two squares on top and one square on the bottom, so it's more like a 2x2 square with the bottom right square missing? Or is it two squares on top and one on the bottom, making it a 3x1 vertical stack? Hmm, no, because it's two squares in the top row and one in the bottom. So, it's a 2x2 grid where the bottom right square is missing. That would look like a square with a bite taken out of the bottom right corner.\n\nShape B is:\n\u2b1c\n\u2b1c\u2b1c\nSo that's one square on the top and two squares on the bottom. So, it's like a 2x1 vertical stack with an extra square on the bottom, making it a 3x1 vertical line with the top two squares connected and the bottom one separate. Or wait, no, it's a single square on top and two squares below, so it's a vertical line of three squares with the top one and the two below.\n\nShape C is:\n\u2b1c\n\u2b1c\n\u2b1c\nThat's three squares stacked vertically. So, it's a 3x1 vertical line.\n\nShape D is:\n\u2b1c\u2b1c\u2b1c\nThat's three squares in a horizontal row. So, it's a 1x3 horizontal line.\n\nNow, the question is, which of these shapes can be rotated to match shape B. Remember, only rotation is allowed, no flipping or turning over. So, I need to see if any of these can be rotated (in any degree, but likely 90, 180, 270, 360) to become shape B.\n\nLet me start by analyzing shape B. Shape B is a vertical stack of three squares: one on top and two below. So, it's like a vertical 'I' with an extra square at the bottom. Wait, no, it's actually three squares in a vertical line, each on top of each other. So, the top one is the highest, then the middle one, then the bottom one. So, it's a straight vertical line of three squares.\n\nNow, I need to see which of the other shapes can be rotated to match this. Let's go through each shape one by one.\n\nStarting with Shape A. Shape A is a 2x2 square missing the bottom right square, making it an L-shape but with two squares on top and one on the bottom. If I rotate this shape, can it become a vertical line of three squares?\n\nLet me think about the possible rotations of Shape A. Since it's a rectangle, rotating it 90 degrees would change its orientation. But let's see:\n\n- Original orientation: two squares on top, one on the bottom. So, it's like a 2x2 square missing the bottom right. If I rotate it 90 degrees clockwise, the top row becomes the right side, and the bottom row becomes the left side. So, the two squares on the right would be on the top, and the one on the left would be on the bottom. Wait, that's not a straight line. Let me visualize it better.\n\nImagine Shape A as:\n\n\u2b1c\u2b1c\n\u2b1c\n\nIf I rotate it 90 degrees clockwise, the top row becomes the right side, and the bottom row becomes the left side. So, the right side would have two squares, and the left side would have one square. So, it would look like:\n\n\u2b1c\n\u2b1c\u2b1c\n\nWait, that's exactly shape B! So, rotating Shape A 90 degrees clockwise would result in shape B. Therefore, Shape A can be rotated to match shape B.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. If I rotate Shape A 90 degrees clockwise, the two squares on the top become the right side, and the single square on the bottom becomes the left side. So, yes, it would have one square on the left and two on the right, which is the same as shape B. So, Shape A can be rotated to become shape B.\n\nNow, let's check Shape C to be thorough. Shape C is three squares stacked vertically. If I rotate it 90 degrees clockwise, it becomes three squares in a horizontal line. So, it becomes shape D. But shape D is three squares in a horizontal line, which is different from shape B, which is three squares in a vertical line. So, Shape C can't be rotated to become shape B.\n\nShape D is three squares in a horizontal line. If I rotate it 90 degrees clockwise, it becomes three squares in a vertical line, which is shape C. So, again, not shape B.\n\nSo, from this analysis, only Shape A can be rotated to match shape B. Therefore, the answer should be Shape A.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Is there any other rotation that could make Shape A look like shape B? For example, rotating it 180 degrees. Let's see: rotating Shape A 180 degrees would flip it, but since we can't flip, only rotate. So, rotating it 180 degrees would make the two squares on top become the two squares on the bottom, but since it's a 2x2 square missing the bottom right, rotating it 180 degrees would make it a 2x2 square missing the top right. That doesn't match shape B, which is a vertical line of three squares.\n\nSimilarly, rotating Shape A 270 degrees clockwise would make it a vertical line of two squares on the left and one on the right, but not a straight vertical line of three squares.\n\nSo, the only rotation that works is 90 degrees clockwise, making Shape A into shape B.\n\nTherefore, the answer is Shape A.\n</think>\n\nThe shape that can be rotated to match shape B is shape A. \n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Understand the given shapes:**\n   - **Shape A:** Two squares on top and one on the bottom, forming an L-shape missing the bottom right square.\n   - **Shape B:** Three squares in a vertical line.\n   - **Shape C:** Three squares stacked vertically.\n   - **Shape D:** Three squares in a horizontal row.\n\n2. **Identify possible rotations for Shape A:**\n   - Rotating Shape A 90 degrees clockwise changes its orientation from a vertical L-shape to a vertical line of three squares.\n\n3. **Verify other shapes:**\n   - Shapes B, C, and D, when rotated, do not match the configuration of shape B.\n\n**Answer:** Shape A can be rotated to match shape B.\n\nDONE."

They're all made up of identical rectangular blocks arranged differently. The question is asking which of these shapes can be rotated to match shape B. I can only rotate them, not flip or turn them over. Okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each shape looks like. Since I can't see the images, I have to go based on their descriptions. Let me try to visualize them.\n\nShape A is described as two blocks on top of each other, each with two blocks. So, it's like a 2x2 square, right? Because each block is a rectangle, and if they're placed side by side, that makes a bigger rectangle. Wait, no, actually, if each block is a rectangle, then two blocks side by side would make a 1x2 rectangle. But if they're stacked, then it's a 2x1 rectangle. Hmm, maybe I need to clarify.\n\nWait, the problem says \"identical rectangular blocks.\" So each block is a rectangle, but when they're arranged, they form these shapes. So, for Shape A: \"\u2b1c\u2b1c on top of \u2b1c.\" So, that would be two blocks stacked vertically, each made up of two blocks horizontally? Or is it two blocks side by side vertically?\n\nWait, maybe I should think of each block as a unit. So, for example, Shape A: the top row has two blocks side by side, and the bottom row has one block. So it's like a T-shape? No, wait, no, the description is:\n\nA: \u2b1c\u2b1c on top of \u2b1c. So, it's two blocks on top of one block. So, it's a vertical stack of three blocks, with the top two blocks adjacent to each other. So, it's like a 2x2 square with the top two blocks connected, making an L-shape.\n\nSimilarly, Shape B: \u2b1c on top of \u2b1c\u2b1c. So, it's one block on top of two blocks. So, it's an L-shape as well, but the opposite way\u2014two blocks on the bottom and one on top.\n\nShape C: \u2b1c on top of \u2b1c on top of \u2b1c. So, three blocks stacked vertically, each as a single block. So, it's a straight vertical line of three blocks.\n\nShape D: \u2b1c\u2b1c\u2b1c. So, three blocks in a horizontal line, each side by side. So, it's a straight horizontal line of three blocks.\n\nOkay, so now I have to figure out which of these can be rotated to match shape B. Shape B is two blocks on the bottom and one on top, making an L-shape with the longer part on the bottom.\n\nSo, I need to see which of the other shapes can be rotated into this L-shape.\n\nLet's go one by one.\n\nStarting with Shape A: it's two blocks on top of one block. So, it's an L-shape with the longer part on top. If I rotate it 90 degrees clockwise, the longer part becomes on the right side. But shape B has the longer part on the bottom. So, is that the same? Wait, no. Because shape A, when rotated 90 degrees, would have the longer side on the right, but shape B has the longer side on the bottom. So, they might not match.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me visualize it.\n\nShape A: imagine it's like a vertical column of three blocks, with the top two blocks connected side by side. So, it's like two blocks on top, making a horizontal line, and then one block below them, connected to the middle of the two blocks. So, it's an L-shape with the top part having two blocks and the bottom part having one block.\n\nIf I rotate this shape 90 degrees clockwise, the top part would now be on the right side, and the bottom part would be on the left. So, the L-shape would have two blocks on the right and one on the left. But shape B has two blocks on the bottom and one on top. So, they are different orientations.\n\nWait, but if I rotate it 180 degrees, would that help? Let's see. Rotating 180 degrees would flip the shape, but since we can't flip, only rotate. So, rotating 180 degrees would make the top part now the bottom part, but flipped. But since we can't flip, it's just a rotation. So, rotating 180 degrees would make the L-shape have two blocks on the bottom and one on top. So, that would match shape B.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think again.\n\nOriginal Shape A: two blocks on top, one below. So, it's like:\n\n\u2b1c\u2b1c\n\u2b1c\n\nIf I rotate this 180 degrees, the top becomes the bottom, and the left becomes the right. So, the two blocks on top would now be on the bottom, but mirrored. However, since we can't flip, only rotate, the arrangement of the blocks remains the same relative to each other, just their position relative to the table changes.\n\nWait, no. When you rotate a shape, the orientation changes, but the blocks themselves don't flip. So, the two blocks that were on top would now be on the bottom, but their order would stay the same. So, Shape A rotated 180 degrees would have the two blocks on the bottom and one on top. So, it would look like shape B.\n\nBut wait, shape B is two blocks on the bottom and one on top, making an L-shape. So, yes, Shape A rotated 180 degrees would match shape B.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"only allowed to rotate these shapes in the plane (no flipping or turning over).\" So, can I rotate 180 degrees? Yes, because that's just a rotation, not a flip or a turn over.\n\nSo, Shape A can be rotated to match shape B.\n\nWait, but let me check the other shapes to be thorough.\n\nShape C: three blocks stacked vertically. If I rotate it, it would still be three blocks in a vertical line, just the direction changes. So, it can't form an L-shape, so it can't match shape B.\n\nShape D: three blocks in a horizontal line. If I rotate it, it's still three blocks in a horizontal line. So, it can't form an L-shape either. So, it can't match shape B.\n\nSo, only Shape A can be rotated to match shape B.\n\nWait, but let me double-check Shape A. If I rotate it 180 degrees, the two blocks on top become the two blocks on the bottom, and the single block is still in the middle. So, yes, it forms the same L-shape as shape B, just mirrored. But since we can't flip, the arrangement is the same relative to the table, just rotated.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be Shape A.\n</think>\n\nThe shape that can be rotated to match shape B is **A**. When rotated 180 degrees, shape A forms the same L-shape as shape B.\n\n**Answer:** A\n\nDONE."
