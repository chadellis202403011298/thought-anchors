  "question": "Four identical rectangular blocks are arranged on a table as shown below (top view):\n\nA: \u2b1c\u2b1c\n   \u2b1c\n\nB: \u2b1c\n   \u2b1c\u2b1c\n\nC: \u2b1c\n   \u2b1c\n   \u2b1c\n\nD: \u2b1c\u2b1c\u2b1c\n\nIf you are only allowed to rotate these shapes in the plane (no flipping or turning over), which of these shapes can be rotated to match shape B?",
  "answer": "The answer is shape A.\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to mentally rotate each shape and see if it can match shape B after rotation.\n\nShape B looks like this: \n\u2b1c\n\u2b1c\u2b1c\n\nLet's analyze each shape:\n\nShape A: \u2b1c\u2b1c\n       \u2b1c\n\nIf we rotate shape A 90 degrees clockwise, we get:\n\u2b1c\n\u2b1c\u2b1c\n\nThis matches shape B, so A can be rotated to match B.\n\nShape C: \u2b1c\n       \u2b1c\n       \u2b1c\n\nNo matter how we rotate shape C, it will always be three blocks in a straight line at some angle. It cannot form the L-shape of B.\n\nShape D: \u2b1c\u2b1c\u2b1c\n\nSimilar to C, shape D is three blocks in a straight line. Rotating it will not create the L-shape of B.\n\nTherefore, only shape A can be rotated to match shape B."
