It is then cut into 27 identical 1\u00d71\u00d71 centimeter cubes. How many of these small cubes have exactly two faces painted red? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this problem about a wooden cube that's 3x3x3 centimeters. It's painted red on all six faces, and then it's cut into 27 smaller 1x1x1 cubes. The question is asking how many of these small cubes have exactly two faces painted red.\n\nHmm, okay. Let me visualize this. A 3x3x3 cube is like a Rubik's cube, right? It has three layers in each dimension: length, width, and height. Each face of the cube is a 3x3 grid of smaller cubes.\n\nFirst, let me think about the painting process. The entire outer surface is painted red, so all the small cubes on the surfaces will have at least one face painted. The ones in the interior won't have any paint.\n\nNow, the problem is specifically about small cubes with exactly two faces painted. That means these cubes must be on the edges or corners of the larger cube, but not on the vertices where three faces meet because those would have three painted faces.\n\nWait, let me confirm that. If a small cube is at a corner, it's part of three faces, so it would have three painted faces. Similarly, if it's on an edge but not at a corner, it's part of two faces. So, the cubes with exactly two painted faces are those that are on the edges but not at the corners.\n\nSo, to find how many such cubes there are, I need to count all the edge cubes minus the corner cubes.\n\nFirst, how many edges does a cube have? A cube has 12 edges. Each edge is a straight line of small cubes. Since the cube is 3x3x3, each edge has 3 small cubes. But wait, the two at the ends of each edge are the corner cubes, which we don't want because they have three painted faces. So, each edge has 3 small cubes, but we need to subtract the two corners, leaving 1 cube per edge that has exactly two painted faces.\n\nSo, if each edge contributes 1 cube with exactly two painted faces, and there are 12 edges, that would give 12 small cubes. But wait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, no, in a 3x3x3 cube, each edge has 3 small cubes, but the two at the ends are corners. So, the middle cube on each edge is the one with exactly two painted faces. Therefore, each edge contributes 1 such cube. Since there are 12 edges, that would indeed be 12 small cubes.\n\nBut let me think again. Maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let's break it down differently.\n\nEach face of the cube has a 3x3 grid. The cubes on the edges of each face are the ones that might have two painted faces. But since the cube is three-dimensional, the edges are where two faces meet, and the corners are where three faces meet.\n\nSo, on each face, the edge cubes are the ones along the perimeter. Each face has four edges, each with 3 small cubes. But again, the corners are shared between faces.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider each face's perimeter. Each face has a perimeter of 4 edges, each with 3 small cubes. So, 4 edges * 3 cubes = 12. But this counts each corner cube twice because each corner is shared by two faces.\n\nThere are 4 corners on a cube, each corner belonging to three faces. But when we count the perimeter of each face, we count each corner cube once per face. Since there are 6 faces, each corner is counted 6 times. Wait, that can't be right. Let me clarify.\n\nNo, actually, each corner is shared by three faces, but when we count the perimeter of each face, each corner is only part of one face's perimeter. Wait, no, that's not correct either. Each corner belongs to three edges, each of which is part of a different face.\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Maybe a better approach is to categorize the small cubes based on their positions in the larger cube.\n\nIn a 3x3x3 cube, the small cubes can be categorized as:\n\n1. Corner cubes: These are the cubes at the vertices. There are 8 corners in a cube, so there are 8 small cubes with three painted faces.\n\n2. Edge cubes (not corners): These are the cubes along the edges but not at the corners. Each edge has 3 small cubes, but the two at the ends are corners, so each edge has 1 cube with exactly two painted faces. Since there are 12 edges, this gives 12 small cubes with exactly two painted faces.\n\n3. Face centers: These are the cubes in the center of each face. There are 6 faces, so 6 small cubes, each with exactly one painted face.\n\n4. The very center of the cube: This is the small cube that's completely inside, not touching any face. So, it has no painted faces.\n\nWait, so if I add these up: 8 (corners) + 12 (edges) + 6 (face centers) + 1 (inner center) = 27, which matches the total number of small cubes. So, that seems to check out.\n\nTherefore, the number of small cubes with exactly two painted faces is 12.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in counting the edges. Each edge has 3 small cubes, but two are corners, so one is the edge cube with two painted faces. Since there are 12 edges, that's 12 small cubes. Yes, that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that on each edge, the middle cube is the one with exactly two painted faces. So, for each of the 12 edges, that's one cube, so 12 in total.\n\nSo, I think the answer is 12 small cubes with exactly two faces painted red.\n</think>\n\nThe small cubes with exactly two painted faces are the ones located along the edges of the larger cube, excluding the corners. Since each edge of the 3\u00d73\u00d73 cube has 3 small cubes, and the two at the ends are corners, each edge contributes 1 cube with exactly two painted faces. There are 12 edges on a cube, so there are 12 such small cubes.\n\nDONE."

It is then cut into 27 identical 1\u00d71\u00d71 centimeter cubes. How many of these small cubes have exactly two faces painted red? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nTo determine how many small cubes have exactly two faces painted red, let's analyze the position of each small cube within the larger 3x3x3 cube.\n\nFirst, identify the different positions of the small cubes:\n1. **Corner Cubes**: These are at the eight corners of the larger cube. Each corner cube has three painted faces.\n2. **Edge Cubes (excluding corners)**: These are located along the edges but not at the corners. Each edge has one such cube.\n3. **Face Cubes (excluding edges and corners)**: These are in the center of each face of the larger cube. Each face has one such cube.\n4. **Inner Cubes**: These are completely inside the larger cube, not touching any outer faces.\n\nSince we're interested in cubes with exactly two painted faces, we can eliminate the corner cubes (three painted faces) and the inner cubes (no painted faces). This leaves us with the edge cubes and the face center cubes.\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of each type:\n- **Edge Cubes**: There are 12 edges on a cube. Each edge has one cube that is not a corner. Therefore, there are 12 edge cubes with exactly two painted faces.\n- **Face Center Cubes**: Each face of the cube has one center cube. Since a cube has 6 faces, there are 6 face center cubes with exactly two painted faces.\n\nAdding these together, we have 12 edge cubes plus 6 face center cubes, totaling 18 small cubes with exactly two faces painted red.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many small cubes have exactly two faces painted red, let's analyze the structure of the larger cube and the positions of the smaller cubes within it.\n\n1. **Understanding the Larger Cube:**\n   - The larger cube measures 3\u00d73\u00d73 centimeters.\n   - It is painted red on all six faces.\n   - After painting, it is cut into 27 identical 1\u00d71\u00d71 centimeter cubes.\n\n2. **Identifying Positions of the Small Cubes:**\n   - **Corner Cubes:** These are located at the corners of the larger cube.

How many of these small cubes have exactly two faces painted red? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this problem here about a wooden cube that's 3\u00d73\u00d73 centimeters. It's painted red on all six faces, and then it's cut into 27 identical 1\u00d71\u00d71 centimeter cubes. The question is asking how many of these small cubes have exactly two faces painted red.\n\nHmm, okay. Let me try to visualize this. A 3\u00d73\u00d73 cube is like a Rubik's cube, right? It's got three layers in each dimension. So, when it's painted on all six faces, all the outer surfaces are red. Then, when you cut it into 1\u00d71\u00d71 cubes, you have 3 layers along the length, 3 along the width, and 3 along the height, making 27 small cubes in total.\n\nNow, the question is about those small cubes that have exactly two red faces. So, I need to figure out how many of these 27 cubes have exactly two of their faces painted red. \n\nI remember that in problems like this, the position of the small cube within the larger cube determines how many faces are painted. The cubes can be categorized based on their location: corner cubes, edge cubes, face cubes, and inner cubes. \n\nFirst, let's think about the corner cubes. A cube has 8 corners, and each corner cube has three faces painted. So, none of the corner cubes will have exactly two faces painted. \n\nNext, let's consider the edges. Each edge of the cube has small cubes that are not at the corners. Since the original cube is 3\u00d73\u00d73, each edge has 3 small cubes, but we've already accounted for the two corner cubes. So, each edge has 1 cube that's not a corner. \n\nNow, how many edges does a cube have? A cube has 12 edges. So, if each edge has 1 cube with exactly two faces painted, that would be 12 cubes in total. \n\nWait, but hold on. Let me double-check. If each edge has 1 cube with two painted faces, and there are 12 edges, then yes, that would give us 12 small cubes with exactly two red faces. \n\nBut let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The problem is about a 3\u00d73\u00d73 cube, so each edge is 3 cubes long. The two at the ends are corners, and the one in the middle is the edge cube. So, that's correct\u2014each edge contributes one such cube. \n\nSo, 12 edges \u00d7 1 cube each = 12 cubes with exactly two red faces. \n\nIs there any other position where a cube might have exactly two red faces? Let me think. The face centers. Each face of the cube has a central cube, right? But those central cubes are only on one face, so they have only one face painted. So, they don't have two painted faces. \n\nWhat about the inner cube? The one completely inside, not touching any face. That cube isn't painted at all. So, it has zero painted faces. \n\nSo, the only cubes with exactly two painted faces are the ones on the edges, not at the corners. \n\nTherefore, the total number of small cubes with exactly two red faces is 12. \n\nI think that's it. Let me recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. The cube is 3\u00d73\u00d73, so each edge has 3 small cubes. The two at the ends are corners with three painted faces, and the one in the middle is the edge cube with two painted faces. There are 12 edges, so 12 such cubes. The face centers have only one face painted, and the inner cube has none. So, 12 is the correct number.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many small cubes have exactly two red faces, consider the positions on the larger cube:\n\n1. **Corners**: 8 corners, each with three red faces.\n2. **Edges**: Each edge has 1 small cube (excluding corners) with two red faces. There are 12 edges.\n3. **Faces**: The center of each face has one small cube with one red face.\n4. **Inner Cube**: 1 cube with no red faces.\n\nCalculating the edge cubes: 12 edges \u00d7 1 cube each = 12 cubes.\n\n**Answer:** 12 small cubes have exactly two red faces.\n\nDONE."

It is then cut into 27 identical 1\u00d71\u00d71 centimeter cubes. How many of these small cubes have exactly two faces painted red? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nTo determine how many small cubes have exactly two faces painted red, I'll start by understanding the original cube and the painting process.\n\nThe original cube is 3 cm \u00d7 3 cm \u00d7 3 cm, and all six faces are painted red. After cutting it into 1 cm \u00d7 1 cm \u00d7 1 cm cubes, there are 27 small cubes in total.\n\nNext, I'll consider the positions of the small cubes within the larger cube:\n\n1. **Corner Cubes**: These have three faces painted. There are 8 corners in a cube, so 8 small cubes have three faces painted.\n\n2. **Edge Cubes (excluding corners)**: These have two faces painted. Each edge of the cube has small cubes that are not corners. With 12 edges on a cube, and each edge containing 1 small cube that is not a corner, there are 12 small cubes with two faces painted.\n\n3. **Face Cubes (excluding edges and corners)**: These have one face painted. Each face of the cube has small cubes that are not on the edges or corners. With 6 faces on a cube and each face containing 4 such small cubes, there are 24 small cubes with one face painted.\n\n4. **Internal Cubes**: These have no faces painted. There is 1 internal cube in the center of the larger cube.\n\nFinally, to find the number of small cubes with exactly two faces painted red, I'll add the edge cubes and the corner cubes:\n\n8 (corner cubes) + 12 (edge cubes) = 20 small cubes with exactly two faces painted red.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many of the small cubes have exactly two faces painted red, let's analyze the structure of the larger cube and how painting and cutting affect the small cubes.\n\n1. **Original Cube Dimensions**:\n   - **Length, Width, Height**: 3 cm \u00d7 3 cm \u00d7 3 cm\n   - **Total Small Cubes**: \\(3 \\times 3 \\times 3 = 27\\) small cubes.\n\n2. **Painting Process**:\n   - **All Faces Painted Red**: Each of the 6 faces of the cube is painted entirely red.\n\n3. **Position Analysis**:\n   - **Corner Cubes**:\n     - **Number of Corners**: 8 (each corner of the cube).\n     - **Painted Faces**: 3 faces per corner cube.\n     - **Total Corner Cubes with 3 Red Faces**: 8.\n\n   - **Edge Cubes (excluding corners)**:\n     - **Number of Edges**: 12 (each edge of a cube).\n     - **Cubes per Edge**: 3 cm, but excluding the corners, each edge has \\(3 - 2 = 1\\) cube.\n     - **Total Edge Cubes with 2 Red Faces**: \\(12 \\times 1 = 12\\).\n\n   - **Face Cubes (excluding edges and corners)**:\n     - **Number of Faces**: 6.\n     - **Cubes per Face**: Each face has \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\) cubes, but excluding the edges and corners, there are \\(9 - 4 = 5\\) cubes per face. However, since each edge has 1 cube (excluding corners), we need to adjust:\n     - **Correct Calculation**: Each face has \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\) cubes, with the edges and corners already accounted for. Therefore, the number of face cubes with 1 red face is \\(9 - 4 = 5\\). But since each face is shared by multiple cubes, the total number is actually \\(6 \\times 5 = 30\\). However, this counts each internal face cube only once.\n     - **Total Face Cubes with 1 Red Face**: 24.\n\n   - **Internal Cube**:\n     - **Position**: Center of the cube.\n     - **Painted Faces**: 0.\n     - **Total Internal Cube**: 1.\n\n4. **Calculating Cubes with Exactly Two Red Faces**:\n   - **Edge Cubes (excluding corners)**: 12 cubes have exactly two red faces.\n\n5. **Final Answer**:\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{12}\n   \\]\n\nDONE."

It is then cut into 27 identical 1\u00d71\u00d71 centimeter cubes. How many of these small cubes have exactly two faces painted red? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this problem about a wooden cube. It's 3\u00d73\u00d73 centimeters, and all six faces are painted red. Then it's cut into 27 smaller cubes, each 1\u00d71\u00d71 centimeters. The question is asking how many of these small cubes have exactly two faces painted red.\n\nHmm, okay. Let me try to visualize this. A 3\u00d73\u00d73 cube is like a Rubik's cube, right? It has three layers in each direction: length, width, and height. So, when it's painted on all faces and then cut up, each small cube can have 0, 1, 2, or 3 painted faces depending on where they were in the original cube.\n\nThe problem specifically wants the number of small cubes with exactly two painted faces. So, I need to figure out how many of these 27 small cubes have two red faces.\n\nFirst, let me think about where on the original cube the small cubes with two painted faces would be. In a cube, the small cubes that have two painted faces must be on an edge but not on a corner because corners have three painted faces. So, each edge of the cube will have some small cubes with exactly two painted faces.\n\nBut how many edges does a cube have? A cube has 12 edges: 4 on the top square, 4 on the bottom square, and 4 connecting the top and bottom. Each edge is 3 centimeters long, so when it's cut into 1\u00d71\u00d71 cubes, each edge will have 3 small cubes.\n\nHowever, the two end cubes on each edge are the corners, which have three painted faces. So, if each edge has 3 small cubes, and two of them are corners, that leaves only the middle cube on each edge with exactly two painted faces.\n\nSo, for each edge, there's exactly one small cube with two painted faces. Now, since there are 12 edges on the cube, and each contributes one such small cube, that would suggest there are 12 small cubes with exactly two painted faces.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. If each edge has 3 small cubes, and two are corners, then yes, the middle one is the only one with two painted faces. So, 12 edges times 1 cube each gives 12 small cubes with two painted faces.\n\nBut let me think about the cube structure again. Each face of the cube is a 3\u00d73 grid of small cubes. The cubes on the edges of each face are the ones that might have two painted faces.\n\nBut actually, the two painted faces are on adjacent faces, so they have to be on an edge where two faces meet. That's why they're on the edges of the cube, not just on the edges of a single face.\n\nSo, each edge is shared by two faces, and the small cubes on those edges can have two painted faces. Since each edge has one such cube, and there are 12 edges, it seems consistent that there are 12 small cubes with exactly two painted faces.\n\nBut let me consider another approach to make sure. Let's think about the entire cube and categorize the small cubes based on their positions.\n\n1. **Corner Cubes**: These are the cubes at the corners of the original cube. Each corner cube has three painted faces. There are 8 corners in a cube, so 8 small cubes with three painted faces.\n\n2. **Edge Cubes (excluding corners)**: These are the cubes along the edges but not at the corners. Each edge has 3 small cubes, and two of them are corners, so each edge has 1 small cube with exactly two painted faces. As there are 12 edges, this gives 12 small cubes with two painted faces.\n\n3. **Face Cubes (excluding edges)**: These are the cubes in the center of each face. Each face has a 3\u00d73 grid, so the center cube is the only one on the face that isn't on an edge. Each face has 1 such cube, and there are 6 faces, so 6 small cubes with one painted face.\n\n4. **Internal Cube**: This is the cube that's completely inside the original cube, not touching any outer faces. It has no painted faces. There's only 1 such cube.\n\nAdding these up: 8 (corners) + 12 (edges) + 6 (face centers) + 1 (internal) = 27 small cubes, which matches the total number of small cubes. So, this categorization seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of small cubes with exactly two painted faces is 12.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a different way to compute this? Maybe by considering the positions on each face.\n\nEach face of the original cube has a 3\u00d73 grid. The small cubes on the edges of each face have two painted faces, but actually, those are the ones on the edges of the cube, not just on a single face. So, perhaps I should think in terms of the edges.\n\nEach edge has 3 small cubes, two of which are corners, and one is the middle. So, 12 edges \u00d7 1 cube = 12.\n\nYes, that aligns with what I thought earlier.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute it by considering that on each face, there are edges, but each edge is shared by two faces. So, each small cube with two painted faces is counted once for each face it's on. But since each such cube is on exactly two faces, the total count would still be 12.\n\nI think I'm confident now that the answer is 12.\n</think>\n\nThe small cubes with exactly two painted faces are located on the edges of the original cube, excluding the corners. Each edge of the cube has one such small cube, and there are 12 edges in total. Therefore, there are 12 small cubes with exactly two painted faces.\n\n**Answer:** 12 small cubes have exactly two faces painted red.\n\nDONE."
