  "question": "A researcher wants to test whether a new fertilizer increases tomato plant growth. She has 20 tomato seedlings of the same variety. Design an experiment using the scientific method to test this hypothesis, and explain what makes this a controlled experiment. What would be your independent and dependent variables? What control group would you use? What potential confounding variables should you control for?",
  "answer": "To design a proper experiment using the scientific method, I would follow these steps:\n\n1. State the hypothesis: \"The new fertilizer increases tomato plant growth compared to standard fertilizer.\"\n\n2. Design the experiment:\n   - Independent variable: Type of fertilizer (new fertilizer vs. standard fertilizer)\n   - Dependent variable: Tomato plant growth (measured by height in centimeters after 4 weeks)\n   - Control group: 10 tomato seedlings that receive the standard fertilizer\n   - Experimental group: 10 tomato seedlings that receive the new fertilizer\n\n3. Control for confounding variables:\n   - Use seedlings of identical age and the same variety\n   - Place all plants in the same environment (same temperature, light exposure, and humidity)\n   - Use containers of identical size with the same amount and type of soil\n   - Water all plants with the same amount of water on the same schedule\n   - Apply fertilizers at the same concentration and frequency, only varying the type\n   - Randomly assign plants to either the control or experimental group to avoid selection bias\n\n4. Collect data: Measure plant height in centimeters after 4 weeks\n\n5. Analyze results: Compare the average growth between control and experimental groups using statistical analysis to determine if any difference is significant\n\nThis is a controlled experiment because it isolates the effect of the independent variable (fertilizer type) by keeping all other variables constant between groups. The only difference between the control and experimental groups is the type of fertilizer used, allowing us to determine if any observed difference in growth can be attributed to the new fertilizer."
