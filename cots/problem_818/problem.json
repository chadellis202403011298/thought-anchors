  "question": "In a survey of 120 college students, the following information was collected:\n- 75 students enjoy reading fiction\n- 65 students enjoy reading non-fiction\n- 40 students enjoy reading both fiction and non-fiction\n\nBased on this information, answer the following questions:\n1. How many students enjoy reading fiction but not non-fiction?\n2. How many students enjoy reading non-fiction but not fiction?\n3. How many students do not enjoy reading either type of book?",
  "answer": "To solve this problem, I'll use a Venn diagram approach and follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Identify what we know.\n- Total number of students: 120\n- Students who enjoy fiction: 75\n- Students who enjoy non-fiction: 65\n- Students who enjoy both fiction and non-fiction: 40\n\nStep 2: Calculate how many students enjoy only fiction.\nStudents who enjoy only fiction = Students who enjoy fiction - Students who enjoy both\n= 75 - 40 = 35 students\n\nStep 3: Calculate how many students enjoy only non-fiction.\nStudents who enjoy only non-fiction = Students who enjoy non-fiction - Students who enjoy both\n= 65 - 40 = 25 students\n\nStep 4: Calculate how many students don't enjoy either type of reading.\nFirst, let's find how many students enjoy at least one type:\nStudents enjoying at least one type = (Students who enjoy only fiction) + (Students who enjoy only non-fiction) + (Students who enjoy both)\n= 35 + 25 + 40 = 100 students\n\nTherefore, students who don't enjoy either type = Total students - Students enjoying at least one type\n= 120 - 100 = 20 students\n\nAnswers:\n1. 35 students enjoy reading fiction but not non-fiction\n2. 25 students enjoy reading non-fiction but not fiction\n3. 20 students do not enjoy reading either type of book"
