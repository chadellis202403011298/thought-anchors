How many students enjoy reading fiction but not non-fiction?\n2. How many students enjoy reading non-fiction but not fiction?\n3. How many students do not enjoy reading either type of book? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I've got this survey data about college students and their reading habits. There are 120 students in total. The data shows that 75 enjoy reading fiction, 65 enjoy reading non-fiction, and 40 enjoy both. I need to figure out three things: how many enjoy only fiction, how many enjoy only non-fiction, and how many don't enjoy either.\n\nFirst, I think I should visualize this with a Venn diagram. There are two circles: one for fiction and one for non-fiction. The overlap between them is the 40 students who enjoy both. So, the total number of students is 120, which is the sum of those who enjoy only fiction, only non-fiction, both, and neither.\n\nLet me denote the number of students who enjoy only fiction as F, and those who enjoy only non-fiction as N. So, according to the problem:\n\nF + N + Both + Neither = Total\n\nI know Both is 40, and Total is 120. So,\n\nF + N + 40 + Neither = 120\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nF + N + Neither = 80\n\nNow, I need to find F and N separately. I have the total number of students who enjoy fiction, which is 75. That includes those who enjoy only fiction and those who enjoy both. So,\n\nF + Both = 75\n\nWe know Both is 40, so:\n\nF = 75 - 40 = 35\n\nSo, 35 students enjoy only fiction.\n\nSimilarly, for non-fiction, the total is 65, which includes those who enjoy only non-fiction and both. So,\n\nN + Both = 65\n\nAgain, Both is 40, so:\n\nN = 65 - 40 = 25\n\nSo, 25 students enjoy only non-fiction.\n\nNow, going back to the equation F + N + Neither = 80, we can plug in the values:\n\n35 + 25 + Neither = 80\n\nSo,\n\n60 + Neither = 80\n\nTherefore,\n\nNeither = 80 - 60 = 20\n\nSo, 20 students don't enjoy reading either type of book.\n</think>\n\nSolution:\n\n1. **Students who enjoy reading fiction but not non-fiction:**\n   - Total students who enjoy fiction = 75\n   - Students who enjoy both fiction and non-fiction = 40\n   - So, students who enjoy only fiction = 75 - 40 = 35\n\n2. **Students who enjoy reading non-fiction but not fiction:**\n   - Total students who enjoy non-fiction = 65\n   - Students who enjoy both fiction and non-fiction = 40\n   - So, students who enjoy only non-fiction = 65 - 40 = 25\n\n3. **Students who do not enjoy reading either type of book:**\n   - Total students = 120\n   - Students who enjoy only fiction = 35\n   - Students who enjoy only non-fiction = 25\n   - Students who enjoy both = 40\n   - So, students who do not enjoy either = 120 - (35 + 25 + 40) = 120 - 100 = 20\n\n**Final Answer:**\n1. 35 students enjoy reading fiction but not non-fiction.\n2. 25 students enjoy reading non-fiction but not fiction.\n3. 20 students do not enjoy reading either type of book.\n\nDONE."

How many students enjoy reading fiction but not non-fiction?\n2. How many students enjoy reading non-fiction but not fiction?\n3. How many students do not enjoy reading either type of book? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I've got this problem here about a survey of 120 college students and their reading habits. Let me try to figure it out step by step. First, let's list out what we know:\n\n- Total students surveyed: 120\n- Students who enjoy reading fiction: 75\n- Students who enjoy reading non-fiction: 65\n- Students who enjoy both fiction and non-fiction: 40\n\nAnd the questions are:\n\n1. How many students enjoy reading fiction but not non-fiction?\n2. How many students enjoy reading non-fiction but not fiction?\n3. How many students do not enjoy reading either type of book?\n\nOkay, starting with question 1: How many students enjoy reading fiction but not non-fiction? Hmm. So, this is about students who like fiction but don't like non-fiction at all. I remember something about sets and maybe using a Venn diagram for this kind of problem. So, if I imagine two overlapping circles, one for fiction and one for non-fiction, the overlapping part is the students who enjoy both.\n\nGiven that 75 students enjoy fiction and 65 enjoy non-fiction, and 40 enjoy both, I think I can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion here. The formula for the total number of students who enjoy either fiction or non-fiction or both would be:\n\nTotal = (Number who enjoy Fiction) + (Number who enjoy Non-Fiction) - (Number who enjoy Both)\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers: 75 + 65 - 40. Let me calculate that: 75 + 65 is 140, minus 40 is 100. So, 100 students enjoy either fiction or non-fiction or both.\n\nBut wait, the total number of students surveyed is 120. So, the number of students who don't enjoy either would be the total minus those who enjoy at least one. That is, 120 - 100 = 20. I'll get to that in question 3, but let's focus on question 1 first.\n\nTo find the number of students who enjoy only fiction and not non-fiction, I think I need to subtract those who enjoy both from the total number who enjoy fiction. So, that would be 75 - 40 = 35. So, 35 students enjoy fiction but not non-fiction.\n\nLet me double-check that. If 40 students enjoy both, then out of the 75 fiction lovers, 40 are also non-fiction readers. So, the remaining 75 - 40 = 35 must be fiction-only. That seems right.\n\nMoving on to question 2: How many students enjoy reading non-fiction but not fiction? This should be similar. So, using the same logic, the total number who enjoy non-fiction is 65, and out of these, 40 also enjoy fiction. So, the number who enjoy only non-fiction is 65 - 40 = 25.\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think again. If 65 enjoy non-fiction and 40 of them also enjoy fiction, then 65 - 40 = 25 enjoy only non-fiction. Yes, that makes sense.\n\nNow, question 3: How many students do not enjoy reading either type of book? As I calculated earlier, the total number who enjoy either is 100, so the remaining students would be those who don't enjoy either. So, 120 - 100 = 20.\n\nLet me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, total students surveyed: 120. Students who enjoy at least one type of book: 100. Therefore, those who don't enjoy either: 20. That seems consistent.\n\nJust to visualize, if I draw a Venn diagram with two circles overlapping, the total area covered by both circles is 100, so the area outside both circles is 20. That aligns with my calculation.\n\nI think I've got it. Let me recap:\n\n1. Fiction-only: 75 - 40 = 35\n2. Non-fiction-only: 65 - 40 = 25\n3. Neither: 120 - (75 + 65 - 40) = 120 - 100 = 20\n\nYes, that all adds up. I don't see any errors in my calculations.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we use the principle of inclusion-exclusion and subtract those who enjoy both from each category to find the numbers who enjoy only one type. Then, we find the total who enjoy either by adding these two results and subtracting the overlap, and finally determine those who don't enjoy either.\n\n1. **Students who enjoy reading fiction but not non-fiction**:\n   - Total fiction lovers = 75\n   - Both fiction and non-fiction = 40\n   - Only fiction = 75 - 40 = 35\n\n2. **Students who enjoy reading non-fiction but not fiction**:\n   - Total non-fiction lovers = 65\n   - Both fiction and non-fiction = 40\n   - Only non-fiction = 65 - 40 = 25\n\n3. **Students who do not enjoy reading either type of book**:\n   - Total students = 120\n   - Total who enjoy either = 75 + 65 - 40 = 100\n   - Neither = 120 - 100 = 20\n\nDONE."

How many students enjoy reading fiction but not non-fiction?\n2. How many students enjoy reading non-fiction but not fiction?\n3. How many students do not enjoy reading either type of book? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this problem about a survey of 120 college students and their reading habits. Let me try to figure it out step by step. First, I'll write down all the given information to make it clearer.\n\nOkay, the survey says:\n- 75 students enjoy reading fiction.\n- 65 students enjoy reading non-fiction.\n- 40 students enjoy reading both fiction and non-fiction.\n\nAnd the total number of students surveyed is 120. \n\nNow, the questions are:\n1. How many students enjoy reading fiction but not non-fiction?\n2. How many students enjoy reading non-fiction but not fiction?\n3. How many students do not enjoy reading either type of book?\n\nHmm, this seems like a problem involving sets and maybe using a Venn diagram to visualize it. Let me recall the principle of inclusion-exclusion for sets. I think it goes like this:\n\nThe total number in either set A or set B is equal to the number in set A plus the number in set B minus the number in both sets A and B.\n\nIn mathematical terms, that's:\n|A \u222a B| = |A| + |B| - |A \u2229 B|\n\nSo, applying that here, where set A is students who enjoy reading fiction and set B is students who enjoy reading non-fiction, the total number of students who enjoy reading either fiction or non-fiction or both would be:\n\n|A \u222a B| = 75 (fiction) + 65 (non-fiction) - 40 (both) = 75 + 65 = 140; 140 - 40 = 100.\n\nSo, 100 students enjoy reading either fiction, non-fiction, or both. But wait, the total number of students surveyed is 120. That means the remaining students didn't enjoy reading either type. Let me note that down for question 3.\n\nNow, moving on to question 1: How many students enjoy reading fiction but not non-fiction?\n\nHmm, that's the number of students who are only in set A, not in set B. In set notation, that would be |A - B|. To find this, I think we can subtract the number of students who enjoy both from the total number who enjoy fiction.\n\nSo, |A - B| = |A| - |A \u2229 B| = 75 - 40 = 35.\n\nSo, 35 students enjoy reading fiction but not non-fiction.\n\nFor question 2: How many students enjoy reading non-fiction but not fiction?\n\nSimilarly, this is the number of students who are only in set B, not in set A. So, |B - A| = |B| - |A \u2229 B| = 65 - 40 = 25.\n\nSo, 25 students enjoy reading non-fiction but not fiction.\n\nAnd for question 3: How many students do not enjoy reading either type of book?\n\nWell, earlier I calculated that 100 students enjoy reading either fiction or non-fiction or both. Since the total number of students is 120, the number who don't enjoy either is 120 - 100 = 20.\n\nLet me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with |A \u222a B| = 75 + 65 - 40 = 100. That seems right because adding 75 and 65 gives 140, and subtracting the overlap of 40 gives 100.\n\nThen, for those who enjoy only fiction, it's 75 total fiction lovers minus the 40 who also like non-fiction, so 35. Similarly, for non-fiction only, it's 65 total minus 40, which is 25. Adding those up: 35 (only fiction) + 25 (only non-fiction) + 40 (both) = 100, which matches the earlier total.\n\nSubtracting that from 120 gives 20 students who don't enjoy either. That all adds up correctly.\n\nSo, I think I've got the answers.\n</think>\n\n1. **Students who enjoy reading fiction but not non-fiction:**  \n   35 students.\n\n2. **Students who enjoy reading non-fiction but not fiction:**  \n   25 students.\n\n3. **Students who do not enjoy reading either type of book:**  \n   20 students.\n\nDONE."

How many students do not enjoy reading either type of book? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I've got this survey data about 120 college students and their reading habits. The question is asking me to find out three specific numbers based on the information provided. Let me break this down step by step because I'm still getting the hang of these kinds of problems.\n\nFirst, the data:\n- 75 students enjoy reading fiction.\n- 65 students enjoy reading non-fiction.\n- 40 students enjoy both fiction and non-fiction.\n\nAnd the total number of students surveyed is 120.\n\nOkay, the first question is: How many students enjoy reading fiction but not non-fiction?\n\nHmm, so this means I need to find out how many students are in the group that likes fiction but excludes those who also like non-fiction. I remember something about sets and Venn diagrams from math class. Maybe I can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion here.\n\nSo, the total number of students who enjoy either fiction or non-fiction or both is equal to the number who enjoy fiction plus the number who enjoy non-fiction minus those who enjoy both. That makes sense because if I just add them, I'm double-counting the ones who like both.\n\nMathematically, that would be:\nNumber who enjoy either = Number who enjoy fiction + Number who enjoy non-fiction - Number who enjoy both.\n\nLet me plug in the numbers:\nEither = 75 + 65 - 40 = 100.\n\nWait, so 100 students enjoy either fiction or non-fiction or both. But the total number of students surveyed is 120. So, how many don't enjoy either?\n\nThat would be the total minus those who enjoy either. So:\nDon't enjoy either = 120 - 100 = 20.\n\nBut hold on, the question is about students who enjoy fiction but not non-fiction. So, that's part of the fiction group minus those who like both.\n\nSo, Number who enjoy only fiction = Number who enjoy fiction - Number who enjoy both.\nThat is 75 - 40 = 35.\n\nSo, 35 students enjoy reading fiction but not non-fiction.\n\nMoving on to the second question: How many students enjoy reading non-fiction but not fiction?\n\nSimilarly, this would be the number who enjoy non-fiction minus those who like both.\n\nSo, Number who enjoy only non-fiction = 65 - 40 = 25.\n\nGot it, so 25 students enjoy non-fiction but not fiction.\n\nFinally, the third question: How many students do not enjoy reading either type of book?\n\nEarlier, I figured out that 20 students don't enjoy either. So, the answer is 20.\n\nLet me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFor the first part, 75 fiction + 65 non-fiction = 140, but since 40 like both, we subtract 40 to get 100 students who like at least one of the genres. So, 120 - 100 = 20 don't like either. That seems right.\n\nThen, for only fiction: 75 total fiction minus 40 who like both is 35. Only non-fiction: 65 total minus 40 is 25. Yes, that adds up.\n\nSo, everything checks out.\n</think>\n\n1. **Students who enjoy reading fiction but not non-fiction**:  \n   We subtract the number of students who enjoy both from those who enjoy fiction.  \n   75 (fiction) - 40 (both) = 35 students.\n\n2. **Students who enjoy reading non-fiction but not fiction**:  \n   Similarly, subtract those who enjoy both from those who enjoy non-fiction.  \n   65 (non-fiction) - 40 (both) = 25 students.\n\n3. **Students who do not enjoy reading either type of book**:  \n   Total students minus those who enjoy either fiction or non-fiction.  \n   120 - 100 = 20 students.\n\n**Answer:**\n1. 35 students  \n2. 25 students  \n3. 20 students  \n\nDONE."

It says 75 students enjoy reading fiction, 65 enjoy reading non-fiction, and 40 enjoy both. I need to find out three things: how many enjoy fiction but not non-fiction, how many enjoy non-fiction but not fiction, and how many don't enjoy either.\n\nFirst, I think I should visualize this with a Venn diagram. There are two circles: one for fiction and one for non-fiction. The overlapping part is where both are enjoyed. The total number of students is 120, so that's the whole set.\n\nThe formula that comes to mind is the principle of inclusion-exclusion. I remember it goes like this: the number of students who enjoy either fiction or non-fiction or both is equal to the number who enjoy fiction plus the number who enjoy non-fiction minus the number who enjoy both. So, in formula terms, that would be:\n\nTotal = Fiction + Non-Fiction - Both\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n120 = 75 + 65 - 40\n\nLet me do the math step by step. 75 plus 65 is 140. Then subtract 40, which gives me 100. So, 100 students enjoy either fiction, non-fiction, or both.\n\nBut wait, the question also asks how many enjoy both. They've already given that as 40. So, if 100 students enjoy at least one of the two, and 40 of those are in both, then how many are only in one category?\n\nFor the first question, how many enjoy fiction but not non-fiction, that would be the total fiction minus those who enjoy both. So, 75 minus 40 equals 35. That seems straightforward.\n\nSimilarly, for the second question, how many enjoy non-fiction but not fiction, it's the total non-fiction minus both, which is 65 minus 40, giving 25.\n\nNow, for the last part, how many don't enjoy either? Since 100 students enjoy at least one, and the total is 120, subtracting 100 from 120 leaves 20. So, 20 students don't enjoy reading either fiction or non-fiction.\n\nLet me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. \n\nFiction only: 75 - 40 = 35\n\nNon-Fiction only: 65 - 40 = 25\n\nBoth: 40\n\nNone: 120 - (35 + 25 + 40) = 120 - 100 = 20\n\nYes, that adds up correctly. So, the answers should be 35, 25, and 20 respectively.\n</think>\n\n1. **Students who enjoy reading fiction but not non-fiction:**  \n   To find students who enjoy only fiction, subtract those who enjoy both from the total number who enjoy fiction.  \n   \\( 75 - 40 = 35 \\)  \n   **Answer:** 35 students.\n\n2. **Students who enjoy reading non-fiction but not fiction:**  \n   Similarly, subtract those who enjoy both from the total number who enjoy non-fiction.  \n   \\( 65 - 40 = 25 \\)  \n   **Answer:** 25 students.\n\n3. **Students who do not enjoy reading either type of book:**  \n   Subtract the number of students who enjoy either fiction or non-fiction from the total number surveyed.  \n   First, find the total who enjoy at least one:  \n   \\( 75 + 65 - 40 = 100 \\)  \n   Then, subtract from 120:  \n   \\( 120 - 100 = 20 \\)  \n   **Answer:** 20 students.\n\n**DONE.**"

How many students enjoy reading fiction but not non-fiction?\n2. How many students enjoy reading non-fiction but not fiction?\n3. How many students do not enjoy reading either type of book? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this survey data about college students and their reading preferences. Let me see how to approach this. The total number of students surveyed is 120. The data given is:\n\n- 75 students enjoy reading fiction.\n- 65 students enjoy reading non-fiction.\n- 40 students enjoy both fiction and non-fiction.\n\nHmm, okay, so I think this is a problem about sets and their overlaps. Maybe I can use a Venn diagram to visualize it. There are two sets: one for fiction lovers and one for non-fiction lovers. The overlap between them is the 40 students who enjoy both.\n\nI remember something about the principle of inclusion-exclusion. It says that the total number in either set is equal to the sum of the numbers in each set minus the number in their intersection. So, in formula terms, that would be:\n\nTotal = Fiction + Non-Fiction - Both\n\nLet me plug in the numbers:\n\nTotal surveyed = 120\nFiction = 75\nNon-Fiction = 65\nBoth = 40\n\nSo,\n\n120 = 75 + 65 - Both\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because 75 plus 65 is 140, which is more than 120. So, if I plug in Both as 40,\n\n120 = 75 + 65 - 40\n\nYes, 75 + 65 is 140, minus 40 gives 100. But wait, that's not 120. Did I do something wrong?\n\nOh, I think I misapplied the formula. The formula should actually be:\n\nTotal = Fiction + Non-Fiction - Both\n\nSo,\n\n120 = 75 + 65 - Both\n\nWait, that's not right because 75 + 65 is 140, which is more than 120. So, the Both can't be 40 because that would give a total of 100. But the actual total surveyed is 120. Hmm, maybe I need to reconsider.\n\nWait, maybe I need to find the number of students who don't read either, which is part of the question. Let me think.\n\nThe question asks for three things:\n\n1. Students who enjoy fiction but not non-fiction.\n2. Students who enjoy non-fiction but not fiction.\n3. Students who don't enjoy either.\n\nSo, maybe I should calculate each part separately.\n\nFor the first part, students who enjoy fiction but not non-fiction. That would be the total fiction readers minus those who enjoy both.\n\nSo, 75 (fiction) - 40 (both) = 35 students enjoy only fiction.\n\nSimilarly, for the second part, students who enjoy non-fiction but not fiction: 65 (non-fiction) - 40 (both) = 25 students.\n\nNow, for the third part, students who don't enjoy either. To find this, I can subtract the number of students who enjoy either fiction or non-fiction from the total surveyed.\n\nBut how do I find the number who enjoy either? Well, the total surveyed is 120. The number who enjoy only fiction is 35, only non-fiction is 25, and both is 40. So, total who enjoy at least one is 35 + 25 + 40 = 100.\n\nTherefore, students who don't enjoy either are 120 - 100 = 20.\n\nLet me check if that makes sense. So, 35 only fiction, 25 only non-fiction, 40 both, and 20 neither. Adding those up: 35 + 25 + 40 + 20 = 120. That matches the total, so it seems correct.\n\nWait, but earlier when I tried using inclusion-exclusion, I got confused. Let me try that again.\n\nInclusion-exclusion principle: Total who enjoy fiction or non-fiction = Fiction + Non-Fiction - Both.\n\nSo,\n\nTotal enjoying at least one = 75 + 65 - 40 = 100.\n\nThus, those who don't enjoy either = 120 - 100 = 20. Yep, that matches.\n\nSo, to answer the questions:\n\n1. Only fiction: 75 - 40 = 35\n2. Only non-fiction: 65 - 40 = 25\n3. Neither: 120 - 100 = 20\n\nI think that's all. Let me just write it down clearly.\n</think>\n\n1. **Students who enjoy reading fiction but not non-fiction:**  \n   To find this, subtract those who enjoy both from the total number of fiction lovers.  \n   \\( 75 - 40 = 35 \\)  \n   So, **35 students** enjoy reading fiction but not non-fiction.\n\n2. **Students who enjoy reading non-fiction but not fiction:**  \n   Subtract those who enjoy both from the total number of non-fiction lovers.  \n   \\( 65 - 40 = 25 \\)  \n   So, **25 students** enjoy reading non-fiction but not fiction.\n\n3. **Students who do not enjoy reading either type of book:**  \n   Subtract the number of students who enjoy at least one type of book from the total surveyed.  \n   First, calculate the total who enjoy at least one:  \n   \\( 75 + 65 - 40 = 100 \\)  \n   Then, subtract from the total surveyed:  \n   \\( 120 - 100 = 20 \\)  \n   So, **20 students** do not enjoy reading either type of book.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n1. 35 students  \n2. 25 students  \n3. 20 students  \nDONE."

How many students enjoy reading fiction but not non-fiction?\n2. How many students enjoy reading non-fiction but not fiction?\n3. How many students do not enjoy reading either type of book? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I've got this problem about a survey of 120 college students and their reading habits. It says that 75 students enjoy reading fiction, 65 enjoy reading non-fiction, and 40 enjoy both. I need to figure out three things: how many students enjoy only fiction, only non-fiction, and how many don't enjoy either. Okay, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I remember something about sets and Venn diagrams from math class. This seems like a problem where two sets overlap, right? So, the total number of students is 120. The two sets are students who enjoy fiction (let's call this set F) and those who enjoy non-fiction (set N). The overlap between these two sets is the 40 students who enjoy both.\n\nI think I can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion here. The formula for the total number in either set is:\n\nTotal = |F| + |N| - |F \u2229 N|\n\nWhere |F| is the number of students who enjoy fiction, |N| is the number who enjoy non-fiction, and |F \u2229 N| is the overlap. So plugging in the numbers:\n\n120 = 75 + 65 - 40\n\nLet me calculate that. 75 plus 65 is 140. Then subtract 40, which gives me 100. Hmm, wait, that doesn't seem right because 100 is less than 120. But actually, that's okay because the 40 students who enjoy both are counted twice when we add 75 and 65. So the total unique students are 100. But the total number of students surveyed is 120, so there must be 120 minus 100, which is 20, who don't enjoy either.\n\nOkay, so part three is 20 students who don't enjoy reading either type of book. That makes sense.\n\nNow, for part one: How many students enjoy reading fiction but not non-fiction? Well, that's the number of students in set F minus those who are in both sets. So that's 75 minus 40, which is 35. So 35 students enjoy only fiction.\n\nSimilarly, for part two: How many enjoy non-fiction but not fiction? That's 65 minus 40, which is 25. So 25 students enjoy only non-fiction.\n\nLet me double-check these numbers to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 35 enjoy only fiction, 25 only non-fiction, 40 enjoy both, and 20 enjoy neither. Adding those up: 35 + 25 is 60, plus 40 is 100, plus 20 is 120. Yep, that matches the total number of students surveyed. So the numbers add up correctly.\n\nI think that's it. So the answers are 35, 25, and 20 for the respective questions.\n</think>\n\n1. **Students who enjoy reading fiction but not non-fiction**:  \n   \\(75\\) (total fiction) - \\(40\\) (both) = \\(35\\).  \n   **Answer**: 35 students.\n\n2. **Students who enjoy reading non-fiction but not fiction**:  \n   \\(65\\) (total non-fiction) - \\(40\\) (both) = \\(25\\).  \n   **Answer**: 25 students.\n\n3. **Students who do not enjoy reading either type of book**:  \n   Total students - (students who enjoy fiction + students who enjoy non-fiction - students who enjoy both)  \n   \\(120\\) - (\\(75 + 65 - 40\\)) = \\(120 - 100 = 20\\).  \n   **Answer**: 20 students.\n\nDONE."

How many students enjoy reading fiction but not non-fiction?\n2. How many students enjoy reading non-fiction but not fiction?\n3. How many students do not enjoy reading either type of book? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this survey data about college students and their reading habits. Let me try to make sense of it step by step. \n\nFirst, the total number of students surveyed is 120. Out of these, 75 enjoy reading fiction. Then, 65 students enjoy reading non-fiction. Also, 40 students like both fiction and non-fiction. Hmm, okay. \n\nI think I need to find out how many students enjoy only fiction, how many enjoy only non-fiction, and how many don't enjoy either. This seems like a problem involving sets and maybe using a Venn diagram would help visualize it. \n\nLet me recall the principle of inclusion-exclusion for sets. The formula for two sets is: \n\nTotal = Number in Fiction (F) + Number in Non-Fiction (N) - Number in Both (F \u2229 N) \n\nSo plugging in the numbers: \n\n120 = 75 + 65 - 40 \n\nLet me compute that. 75 plus 65 is 140, and then subtract 40 gives me 100. Wait, that doesn't make sense because 100 plus the 40 who like both would give me 140, which is more than 120. Hmm, maybe I did something wrong. \n\nOh, no, actually, the total number of students is 120, so the formula should be: \n\nNumber who like only Fiction + Number who like only Non-Fiction + Number who like both = Total \n\nSo, 75 (F) includes those who like both, and 65 (N) also includes those who like both. So to find the unique groups, I need to subtract the overlap. \n\nLet me define:\n\n- Only Fiction = F - Both = 75 - 40 = 35\n- Only Non-Fiction = N - Both = 65 - 40 = 25\n- Both = 40\n\nNow, adding them up: 35 + 25 + 40 = 100. Wait, that's still 100, but the total is 120. So there's a discrepancy here. \n\nAh, I see. The remaining students, 120 - 100 = 20, must be the ones who don't enjoy either fiction or non-fiction. \n\nSo, summarizing:\n\n1. Students who enjoy only Fiction = 35\n2. Students who enjoy only Non-Fiction = 25\n3. Students who enjoy both = 40\n4. Students who enjoy neither = 20\n\nLet me double-check the math to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nTotal students = Only Fiction + Only Non-Fiction + Both + Neither \n\nWhich is 35 + 25 + 40 + 20 = 120. Yep, that adds up correctly.\n\nSo, the answers should be:\n\n1. Only Fiction = 35\n2. Only Non-Fiction = 25\n3. Neither = 20\n</think>\n\n1. **Students who enjoy reading fiction but not non-fiction:** 35  \n2. **Students who enjoy reading non-fiction but not fiction:** 25  \n3. **Students who do not enjoy reading either type of book:** 20  \n\nDONE."

How many students enjoy reading fiction but not non-fiction?\n2. How many students enjoy reading non-fiction but not fiction?\n3. How many students do not enjoy reading either type of book? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I've got this survey data about college students and their reading habits. Let me try to figure out the answers step by step. \n\nFirst, the total number of students surveyed is 120. That's good to know because it will help me check my work later. Now, the data provided is:\n\n- 75 students enjoy reading fiction.\n- 65 students enjoy reading non-fiction.\n- 40 students enjoy both fiction and non-fiction.\n\nOkay, so the first question is: How many students enjoy reading fiction but not non-fiction? Hmm, that means I need to find out how many students are in the fiction group who don't also read non-fiction. \n\nI remember something about sets and Venn diagrams from math class. The total number who enjoy fiction includes those who also enjoy non-fiction. So, if 40 students enjoy both, then the number who enjoy only fiction should be the total fiction minus those who enjoy both. \n\nSo, that would be 75 (fiction) minus 40 (both) = 35 students who enjoy only fiction. That seems right. \n\nMoving on to the second question: How many students enjoy reading non-fiction but not fiction? This is similar to the first one but flipped. The total non-fiction is 65, and out of those, 40 also enjoy fiction. So, to find those who only enjoy non-fiction, I subtract the overlap. \n\nSo, 65 (non-fiction) minus 40 (both) = 25 students who enjoy only non-fiction. \n\nNow, the third question is trickier: How many students do not enjoy reading either type of book? This means I need to find out how many students are outside both the fiction and non-fiction groups. \n\nI think I can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion here. The formula is:\n\nTotal = Fiction + Non-Fiction - Both + Neither\n\nWe know the total is 120, and we have the numbers for Fiction, Non-Fiction, and Both. So, plugging in the numbers:\n\n120 = 75 + 65 - 40 + Neither\n\nLet me calculate that:\n\n75 + 65 is 140. Then, 140 - 40 is 100. So, 120 = 100 + Neither\n\nThat means Neither = 120 - 100 = 20 students.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. If 75 enjoy fiction, 65 enjoy non-fiction, and 40 enjoy both, then the number who enjoy either is 75 + 65 - 40 = 100. So, 100 students enjoy at least one type, which means 120 - 100 = 20 don't enjoy either. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\n1. Only Fiction: 35\n2. Only Non-Fiction: 25\n3. Neither: 20\n\nI think that's all. Let me make sure I didn't mix up any numbers. Fiction is 75, subtract the overlap 40, gives 35. Non-Fiction is 65, subtract 40 gives 25. Then, using inclusion-exclusion, 75 + 65 - 40 = 100 enjoy at least one, so 20 don't. Yep, that checks out.\n</think>\n\n1. **Students who enjoy reading fiction but not non-fiction**:  \n   To find this, subtract the number of students who enjoy both from the total number of students who enjoy fiction.  \n   \\( 75 \\text{ (fiction)} - 40 \\text{ (both)} = 35 \\)  \n   So, **35 students** enjoy reading fiction but not non-fiction.\n\n2. **Students who enjoy reading non-fiction but not fiction**:  \n   Similarly, subtract the number of students who enjoy both from the total number of students who enjoy non-fiction.  \n   \\( 65 \\text{ (non-fiction)} - 40 \\text{ (both)} = 25 \\)  \n   So, **25 students** enjoy reading non-fiction but not fiction.\n\n3. **Students who do not enjoy reading either type of book**:  \n   Use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the number of students who enjoy at least one type of book, then subtract this from the total number of students.  \n   Total who enjoy at least one type: \\( 75 + 65 - 40 = 100 \\)  \n   Therefore, students who do not enjoy either: \\( 120 - 100 = 20 \\)  \n   So, **20 students** do not enjoy reading either type of book.\n\nDONE."

Let me try to figure out the answers step by step. \n\nFirst, the total number of students surveyed is 120. Out of these, 75 enjoy reading fiction, 65 enjoy reading non-fiction, and 40 enjoy both. Hmm, okay. I think I need to use some set theory or Venn diagram principles here. \n\nI remember something about the principle of inclusion-exclusion. It goes like this: the total number of students who enjoy either fiction or non-fiction or both is equal to the number who enjoy fiction plus the number who enjoy non-fiction minus the number who enjoy both. So, in formula terms, that would be:\n\nTotal = Fiction + Non-Fiction - Both\n\nLet me plug in the numbers:\n\nTotal surveyed = 120  \nFiction = 75  \nNon-Fiction = 65  \nBoth = 40\n\nSo,\n\n120 = 75 + 65 - 40\n\nLet me do the math: 75 + 65 is 140, and 140 - 40 is 100. Wait, that doesn't make sense because 100 is less than 120. Hmm, maybe I got the formula wrong. Oh, right! The formula should actually be:\n\nNumber who enjoy either = Fiction + Non-Fiction - Both  \nBut since the total surveyed is 120, that would mean that 120 = 75 + 65 - Both. So Both = 75 + 65 - 120. Let me calculate that:\n\n75 + 65 is 140. 140 - 120 is 20. Wait, that can't be right because the problem says 40 students enjoy both. Did I do something wrong?\n\nOh, I think I misunderstood the formula. Maybe I should consider that the total number of students is the number who enjoy only fiction plus only non-fiction plus both. So:\n\nTotal = Only Fiction + Only Non-Fiction + Both  \n120 = Only Fiction + Only Non-Fiction + 40\n\nSo, Only Fiction + Only Non-Fiction = 120 - 40 = 80\n\nNow, how do I find Only Fiction and Only Non-Fiction separately? I think I need to subtract the overlap from each category.\n\nOnly Fiction = Fiction - Both  \nOnly Non-Fiction = Non-Fiction - Both\n\nSo,\n\nOnly Fiction = 75 - 40 = 35  \nOnly Non-Fiction = 65 - 40 = 25\n\nThen, adding those up: 35 + 25 + 40 = 100. Wait, that's only 100, but the total is 120. So, 120 - 100 = 20 students don't enjoy either. That must be the answer to the third question.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\n1. Only Fiction = 35  \n2. Only Non-Fiction = 25  \n3. Neither = 20\n\nI think that makes sense because when I add Only Fiction, Only Non-Fiction, and Both, I get 35 + 25 + 40 = 100, and adding the 20 who don't enjoy either gives me 120, which matches the total surveyed.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we use the principle of inclusion-exclusion and set theory.\n\n1. **Only Fiction**:  \n   Subtract the number of students who enjoy both from those who enjoy fiction.  \n   Only Fiction = 75 - 40 = 35.\n\n2. **Only Non-Fiction**:  \n   Subtract the number of students who enjoy both from those who enjoy non-fiction.  \n   Only Non-Fiction = 65 - 40 = 25.\n\n3. **Neither Fiction nor Non-Fiction**:  \n   Subtract the total number of students who enjoy either from the total surveyed.  \n   Neither = 120 - (35 + 25 + 40) = 120 - 100 = 20.\n\n**Answer:**\n\n1. 35 students enjoy reading fiction but not non-fiction.  \n2. 25 students enjoy reading non-fiction but not fiction.  \n3. 20 students do not enjoy reading either type of book.  \nDONE."
