  "question": "Consider the following statement: 'All successful entrepreneurs take risks, but not all risk-takers are successful entrepreneurs.' Based on this statement, which of the following conclusions must be true?\n\nA. Some risk-takers are not successful entrepreneurs.\nB. All entrepreneurs are risk-takers.\nC. Some successful people are not entrepreneurs.\nD. No successful entrepreneurs avoid taking risks.",
  "answer": "The correct answer is A: Some risk-takers are not successful entrepreneurs.\n\nLet's analyze the original statement step by step:\n\n1. 'All successful entrepreneurs take risks' means that every single person who is a successful entrepreneur also has the quality of being a risk-taker. This establishes that the set of successful entrepreneurs is completely contained within the set of risk-takers.\n\n2. 'Not all risk-takers are successful entrepreneurs' means that there exist some risk-takers who are not successful entrepreneurs. In other words, the set of risk-takers is larger than and contains the set of successful entrepreneurs.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. 'Some risk-takers are not successful entrepreneurs.' This directly restates the second part of our original statement, just phrased differently. Since we know that 'not all risk-takers are successful entrepreneurs,' it logically follows that 'some risk-takers are not successful entrepreneurs.' This must be true.\n\nB. 'All entrepreneurs are risk-takers.' The original statement only talks about 'successful entrepreneurs,' not all entrepreneurs in general. We can't conclude anything about entrepreneurs who aren't successful, so this doesn't necessarily follow.\n\nC. 'Some successful people are not entrepreneurs.' The original statement doesn't discuss successful people in general, only successful entrepreneurs. We can't draw any conclusions about other types of successful people.\n\nD. 'No successful entrepreneurs avoid taking risks.' This is just a restatement of 'All successful entrepreneurs take risks' using double negation. While this is true based on the original statement, it's not a new conclusion - it's just repeating the first part of the given information.\n\nTherefore, the only conclusion that must be true based solely on the given statement is option A."
