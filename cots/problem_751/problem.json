  "question": "Consider the following sequence where each new term is formed by adding the two previous terms: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...\n\nIf we define a new sequence where each term is the remainder when a term in the original sequence is divided by 3, what is the length of the repeating pattern in this new sequence? In other words, after how many terms does the pattern of remainders start to repeat?",
  "answer": "Step 1: Let's find the remainder when each term in the original sequence is divided by 3.\n\nOriginal sequence: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...\n\nRemainders when divided by 3:\n- 1 \u00f7 3 = 0 remainder 1\n- 1 \u00f7 3 = 0 remainder 1\n- 2 \u00f7 3 = 0 remainder 2\n- 3 \u00f7 3 = 1 remainder 0\n- 5 \u00f7 3 = 1 remainder 2\n- 8 \u00f7 3 = 2 remainder 2\n- 13 \u00f7 3 = 4 remainder 1\n- 21 \u00f7 3 = 7 remainder 0\n- 34 \u00f7 3 = 11 remainder 1\n- 55 \u00f7 3 = 18 remainder 1\n- 89 \u00f7 3 = 29 remainder 2\n\nSo our sequence of remainders is: 1, 1, 2, 0, 2, 2, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 0, ...\n\nStep 2: Look for a repeating pattern in the remainders.\nI notice that the 8th term (remainder 0) matches the 4th term, and the 9th term (remainder 1) matches the 5th term, and so on.\n\nLet's compare more carefully:\n- Terms 1-8: 1, 1, 2, 0, 2, 2, 1, 0\n- Terms 9-16: 1, 1, 2, 0, 2, 2, 1, 0\n\nStep 3: Verify that this is indeed the repeating pattern.\nSince each new term in the original sequence is formed by adding the two previous terms, the remainders when divided by 3 must also follow a pattern determined by the remainders of the two previous terms. When we add two numbers and take the remainder of the sum when divided by 3, it's equivalent to adding the remainders of the two numbers (mod 3). Since there are only finitely many possible pairs of remainders mod 3 (specifically, 9 possible pairs), the pattern must eventually repeat.\n\nStep 4: Determine the length of the repeating pattern.\nFrom our observation in step 2, we see that the pattern repeats every 8 terms. Therefore, the length of the repeating pattern in the sequence of remainders is 8."
