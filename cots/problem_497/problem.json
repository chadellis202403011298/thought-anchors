  "answer": "Step 1: Let's break down the sentence structure to identify the main subject and verb.\n\nStep 2: The main clause of the sentence has the structure 'X was praised' where X is the subject receiving praise.\n\nStep 3: 'The chef who prepared the meal that was served at the restaurant owned by the businessman' is a noun phrase that serves as the subject of the main clause.\n\nStep 4: Within this noun phrase, 'who prepared the meal that was served at the restaurant owned by the businessman' is a relative clause that modifies 'The chef'.\n\nStep 5: The core subject-verb relationship is 'The chef was praised'.\n\nStep 6: The meal, restaurant, and businessman are all part of descriptive clauses that provide additional information about the chef, but they are not the subject of the main verb 'was praised'.\n\nStep 7: Therefore, the answer is (A) The chef."
