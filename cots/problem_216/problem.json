  "question": "A team of researchers is conducting a meta-analysis to determine whether a new teaching method improves student test scores compared to traditional methods. They gather the following studies:\n\nStudy 1: Sample size 50 students, mean improvement of 8 points, p-value 0.04\nStudy 2: Sample size 120 students, mean improvement of 6 points, p-value 0.03\nStudy 3: Sample size 30 students, mean improvement of 12 points, p-value 0.08\nStudy 4: Sample size 200 students, mean improvement of 4 points, p-value 0.02\n\nIf the researchers use a significance threshold of p < 0.05 for including studies in their meta-analysis, and want to weight the studies by sample size, which of the following conclusions is most appropriate based on the available information?",
  "answer": "Step 1: Identify which studies meet the significance threshold of p < 0.05.\n- Study 1: p = 0.04, which is < 0.05, so this study is included.\n- Study 2: p = 0.03, which is < 0.05, so this study is included.\n- Study 3: p = 0.08, which is > 0.05, so this study is excluded.\n- Study 4: p = 0.02, which is < 0.05, so this study is included.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the weighted mean improvement for the included studies, using sample size as the weight.\n- Total sample size of included studies = 50 + 120 + 200 = 370 students\n- Study 1 contribution: (50/370) \u00d7 8 = 1.08 points\n- Study 2 contribution: (120/370) \u00d7 6 = 1.95 points\n- Study 4 contribution: (200/370) \u00d7 4 = 2.16 points\n- Weighted mean improvement = 1.08 + 1.95 + 2.16 = 5.19 points\n\nStep 3: Formulate the conclusion.\nThe appropriate conclusion is that, based on the statistically significant studies weighted by sample size, the new teaching method appears to improve student test scores by approximately 5.2 points on average compared to traditional methods. This conclusion appropriately:  \n1. Only includes studies meeting the significance threshold\n2. Weights studies by their sample size, giving more influence to larger studies\n3. Provides a quantitative estimate of the effect size\n4. Acknowledges that the conclusion is based on the available information"
