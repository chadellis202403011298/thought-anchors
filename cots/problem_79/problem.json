  "question": "Consider the following statement: 'If it rains, then the picnic will be cancelled.' Based on this statement, which of the following must be true?\n\nA) If the picnic is not cancelled, then it did not rain.\nB) If the picnic is cancelled, then it rained.\nC) If it does not rain, then the picnic will not be cancelled.\nD) The picnic will be cancelled only if it rains.",
  "answer": "The original statement is an 'if-then' statement (a conditional) that can be represented as: 'If P, then Q' where P = 'it rains' and Q = 'the picnic will be cancelled'.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA) 'If the picnic is not cancelled, then it did not rain.'\nThis is the contrapositive of the original statement. In symbolic form, it's 'If not Q, then not P.' The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, so A must be true.\n\nB) 'If the picnic is cancelled, then it rained.'\nThis is the converse of the original statement ('If Q, then P'). The converse is not logically equivalent to the original statement. Just because the picnic is cancelled doesn't necessarily mean it rained - there could be other reasons for cancellation. So B is not necessarily true.\n\nC) 'If it does not rain, then the picnic will not be cancelled.'\nThis is the inverse of the original statement ('If not P, then not Q'). The inverse is not logically equivalent to the original statement. The original statement doesn't tell us what happens if it doesn't rain. So C is not necessarily true.\n\nD) 'The picnic will be cancelled only if it rains.'\nThis statement means rain is the only condition that leads to cancellation, which is stronger than the original statement. The original only says rain leads to cancellation, but doesn't exclude other potential causes for cancellation. So D is not necessarily true.\n\nThe correct answer is A."
