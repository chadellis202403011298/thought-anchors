The first five terms of the sequence are:\n\n3, 6, 12, 24, 48, ...\n\nHowever, starting from the 6th term, each new term is determined by adding the two previous terms and then subtracting the term that appeared three positions earlier. What is the 8th term of this sequence? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I've got this sequence problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The first five terms are given: 3, 6, 12, 24, 48. Hmm, okay, so let me write those down to visualize them better.\n\nTerm 1: 3  \nTerm 2: 6  \nTerm 3: 12  \nTerm 4: 24  \nTerm 5: 48  \n\nNow, the problem says that starting from the 6th term, each new term is generated by adding the two previous terms and then subtracting the term that appeared three positions earlier. Okay, that sounds a bit complicated, but let me break it down.\n\nSo, for term 6, it should be equal to (term 5 + term 4) minus term (3). Let me write that out:\n\nTerm 6 = Term 5 + Term 4 - Term (3)  \nTerm 6 = 48 + 24 - 12  \nWait, 48 plus 24 is 72, minus 12 is 60. So term 6 is 60.\n\nLet me add that to my list:\n\nTerm 6: 60  \n\nOkay, moving on to term 7. According to the same rule, term 7 should be equal to term 6 + term 5 minus term 4. Let me compute that:\n\nTerm 7 = Term 6 + Term 5 - Term 4  \nTerm 7 = 60 + 48 - 24  \n60 plus 48 is 108, minus 24 is 84. So term 7 is 84.\n\nUpdating the list:\n\nTerm 7: 84  \n\nNow, term 8 is the one we're supposed to find. Using the same formula, term 8 equals term 7 + term 6 minus term 5. Let me calculate that:\n\nTerm 8 = Term 7 + Term 6 - Term 5  \nTerm 8 = 84 + 60 - 48  \n84 plus 60 is 144, minus 48 is 96. So term 8 is 96.\n\nWait a second, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from term 6:\n\nTerm 6: 48 + 24 = 72; 72 - 12 = 60. That seems right.\n\nTerm 7: 60 + 48 = 108; 108 - 24 = 84. That also checks out.\n\nTerm 8: 84 + 60 = 144; 144 - 48 = 96. Yep, that looks correct.\n\nI wonder if there's a pattern here or if it's following a specific sequence. Looking at the terms:\n\n3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 60, 84, 96,...\n\nHmm, the first five terms are doubling each time: 3, 6, 12, 24, 48. Then it starts adding the two previous terms but subtracting a term from three positions back.\n\nWait, let me see if there's another way to look at it. Maybe it's related to Fibonacci, but with a twist because of the subtraction.\n\nIn the Fibonacci sequence, each term is the sum of the two previous terms, but here we're adding two terms and subtracting a third. So it's like a modified Fibonacci sequence.\n\nBut regardless of the pattern, the rule is clear for generating the terms beyond the fifth. So I think my calculations are correct.\n\nJust to be thorough, let me write out the next few terms using the same rule and see if I notice any interesting behavior or if I spot an error.\n\nTerm 9 would be Term 8 + Term 7 - Term 6:  \n96 + 84 = 180; 180 - 60 = 120.\n\nTerm 9: 120  \n\nTerm 10: Term 9 + Term 8 - Term 7:  \n120 + 96 = 216; 216 - 84 = 132.\n\nTerm 10: 132  \n\nTerm 11: Term 10 + Term 9 - Term 8:  \n132 + 120 = 252; 252 - 96 = 156.\n\nTerm 11: 156  \n\nTerm 12: Term 11 + Term 10 - Term 9:  \n156 + 132 = 288; 288 - 120 = 168.\n\nTerm 12: 168  \n\nHmm, I see that the terms are still increasing but not as rapidly as the initial doubling. It seems like the subtraction is slowing down the growth a bit. But I'm not sure if there's a specific reason or pattern here, it might just be the way the rule is defined.\n\nBut since the problem only asks for the 8th term, which I calculated as 96, I think that's the answer. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I feel confident about it.\n</think>\n\nThe 8th term of the sequence is found by applying the given rule to the previous terms. \n\nStarting from the 6th term, each term is calculated as the sum of the two preceding terms minus the term three positions earlier.\n\nTerm 6 = 48 + 24 - 12 = 60  \nTerm 7 = 60 + 48 - 24 = 84  \nTerm 8 = 84 + 60 - 48 = 96  \n\nDONE."

What is the 8th term of this sequence? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this sequence here, and the first five terms are 3, 6, 12, 24, 48. Hmm, let me see if I can figure out the pattern or the rule that generates each term. The problem says that starting from the 6th term, each new term is determined by adding the two previous terms and then subtracting the term that appeared three positions earlier. I need to find the 8th term.\n\nFirst, let me write down the terms I have:\n\n1st term: 3\n\n2nd term: 6\n\n3rd term: 12\n\n4th term: 24\n\n5th term: 48\n\nSo, the 6th term is the first one that's generated by the new rule. Let's break down the rule step by step.\n\nThe rule says: new term = (previous term + the term before that) - (term that appeared three positions earlier).\n\nIn mathematical terms, that would be:\n\na\u2099 = a\u2099\u208b\u2081 + a\u2099\u208b\u2082 - a\u2099\u208b\u2083\n\nOkay, so for the 6th term (n=6), it would be:\n\na\u2086 = a\u2085 + a\u2084 - a\u2083\n\nLet's plug in the values we have:\n\na\u2085 is 48, a\u2084 is 24, and a\u2083 is 12.\n\nSo, a\u2086 = 48 + 24 - 12 = 60.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. So the 6th term is 60.\n\nNow, moving on to the 7th term. Using the same rule:\n\na\u2087 = a\u2086 + a\u2085 - a\u2084\n\nWe already have a\u2086 = 60, a\u2085 = 48, and a\u2084 = 24.\n\nSo, a\u2087 = 60 + 48 - 24 = 84.\n\nOkay, so the 7th term is 84.\n\nNow, for the 8th term:\n\na\u2088 = a\u2087 + a\u2086 - a\u2085\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\na\u2088 = 84 + 60 - 48 = 96.\n\nHmm, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFor a\u2086: 48 + 24 = 72; 72 - 12 = 60. Correct.\n\nFor a\u2087: 60 + 48 = 108; 108 - 24 = 84. Correct.\n\nFor a\u2088: 84 + 60 = 144; 144 - 48 = 96. Correct.\n\nSo, the 8th term should be 96.\n\nI wonder if there's another way to look at this sequence to confirm. The first five terms seem to be doubling each time: 3, 6, 12, 24, 48. So, each term is double the previous one. But starting from the 6th term, the rule changes.\n\nIf I continue the sequence, the 6th term is 60, which is 48 + 24 - 12 = 60. Then 7th is 84, and 8th is 96. Let me see if this pattern makes sense or if there's a different underlying rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a recursive formula or a characteristic equation, but given the problem states the rule, I think following it step by step is sufficient.\n\nYes, I think I've got it right. The 8th term is 96.\n</think>\n\nThe 8th term of the sequence is calculated by applying the given rule step by step. \n\nStarting from the 6th term, each term is the sum of the two preceding terms minus the term three positions earlier. \n\n- 6th term: 48 + 24 - 12 = 60\n- 7th term: 60 + 48 - 24 = 84\n- 8th term: 84 + 60 - 48 = 96\n\nDONE."

What is the 8th term of this sequence? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this sequence here: 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, ... and I need to find the 8th term. The problem says that starting from the 6th term, each new term is generated by adding the two previous terms and then subtracting the term that appeared three positions earlier. Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated, but let me break it down.\n\nFirst, let's make sure I understand the rule correctly. The first five terms are given: 3, 6, 12, 24, 48. So, starting from the 6th term, each term is the sum of the two immediately preceding terms minus the term that's three places before the current one. Let me write that down as a formula.\n\nIf I denote the nth term as a_n, then for n \u2265 6, the rule would be:\n\na_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2} - a_{n-4}\n\nWait, is that right? Let me see. The two previous terms would be a_{n-1} and a_{n-2}, and the term three positions earlier would be a_{n-4}, because three positions before the current term (which is n) would be n - 3, but since we're counting from the previous terms, it's n - 4. Hmm, no, actually, if the current term is n, then three positions earlier would be n - 3. So maybe it's a_{n-3}. Wait, I'm getting confused here.\n\nLet me clarify. Let's say I'm at term n. The two previous terms are a_{n-1} and a_{n-2}. The term that appeared three positions earlier than n would be a_{n-3}, because three positions before n is n - 3. So, the formula should be:\n\na_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2} - a_{n-3}\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it says \"subtracting the term that appeared three positions earlier.\" So, if I'm generating term n, I look three positions back from n, which is term n - 3. So, yes, a_{n-3}.\n\nBut let me check with the given terms to make sure. Let's compute the 6th term using both possibilities.\n\nGiven:\na1 = 3\na2 = 6\na3 = 12\na4 = 24\na5 = 48\n\nIf n = 6:\nCase 1: a6 = a5 + a4 - a3 = 48 + 24 - 12 = 60\nCase 2: a6 = a5 + a4 - a2 = 48 + 24 - 6 = 66\n\nWait, but the problem says starting from the 6th term, each new term is determined by adding the two previous terms and then subtracting the term that appeared three positions earlier. So, it's a_{n-1} + a_{n-2} - a_{n-3}.\n\nTherefore, a6 = a5 + a4 - a3 = 48 + 24 - 12 = 60\n\nSo, a6 = 60.\n\nNow, let's proceed to find a7 using the same rule:\n\na7 = a6 + a5 - a4 = 60 + 48 - 24 = 84\n\nSimilarly, a8 = a7 + a6 - a5 = 84 + 60 - 48 = 96\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I'm applying the rule correctly. Let me write down the terms:\n\na1: 3\na2: 6\na3: 12\na4: 24\na5: 48\na6: 60\na7: 84\na8: 96\n\nLet me verify the rule for each term starting from a6.\n\nFor a6:\na6 = a5 + a4 - a3 = 48 + 24 - 12 = 60 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor a7:\na7 = a6 + a5 - a4 = 60 + 48 - 24 = 84 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nFor a8:\na8 = a7 + a6 - a5 = 84 + 60 - 48 = 96 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nWait, but let me check if this pattern makes sense. Let me see the sequence so far:\n\n3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 60, 84, 96\n\nLooking at the pattern, up to a5, each term is doubling: 3, 6, 12, 24, 48. Then a6 is 60, which is 48 + 24 - 12 = 60. Then a7 is 60 + 48 - 24 = 84. a8 is 84 + 60 - 48 = 96.\n\nIs there a pattern here? Let me see:\n\nFrom a1 to a5: each term is double the previous one.\n\na6 = 60, which is 48 + 24 -12.\n\na7 = 84, which is 60 +48 -24.\n\na8 = 96, which is 84 +60 -48.\n\nWait, if I continue, what would a9 be?\n\na9 = a8 + a7 - a6 = 96 + 84 -60 = 120\n\na10 = a9 + a8 - a7 = 120 + 96 -84 = 132\n\nHmm, this seems like the sequence is increasing, but let me see if I can find a pattern or perhaps a recurrence relation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write the terms as follows:\n\na1 = 3\n\na2 = 6\n\na3 = 12\n\na4 = 24\n\na5 = 48\n\na6 = 60\n\na7 = 84\n\na8 = 96\n\na9 = 120\n\na10 = 132\n\nWait, from a6 onwards, the terms are 60, 84, 96, 120, 132,...\n\nLet me see the differences between consecutive terms:\n\na6 - a5 = 60 -48 =12\n\na7 - a6=84-60=24\n\na8 -a7=96-84=12\n\na9 -a8=120-96=24\n\na10 -a9=132-120=12\n\nSo, the differences are alternating between 12 and 24. That's interesting.\n\nSo, starting from a6, the difference alternates between +12 and +24.\n\nSo, from a6 to a7: +24\n\na7 to a8: +12\n\na8 to a9: +24\n\na9 to a10: +12\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, the sequence from a6 onwards is 60, 84, 96, 120, 132, 144, 168, 180,...\n\nWait, but let's confirm:\n\na6 =60\n\na7=84 (60+24)\n\na8=96 (84+12)\n\na9=120 (96+24)\n\na10=132 (120+12)\n\na11=144 (132+12?) Wait, no, the difference should alternate. Wait, from a10, the next difference should be +24.\n\nWait, a10=132, so a11=132 +24=156\n\na12=156 +12=168\n\na13=168 +24=192\n\na14=192 +12=204\n\nWait, but earlier I thought a10=132, so a11=132+24=156, a12=156+12=168, etc.\n\nBut let me get back to the original question. It asks for the 8th term, which is a8=96.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating a8.\n\nGiven:\n\na6=60\n\na7=84\n\na8= a7 + a6 -a5=84 +60 -48=96\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, let me think if there's a different way to approach this. Maybe the recurrence relation is linear, and we can solve it using characteristic equations.\n\nBut considering that the problem only asks for the 8th term, and I've already calculated up to a8=96, perhaps that's sufficient.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me write down all the terms up to a8:\n\na1=3\n\na2=6\n\na3=12\n\na4=24\n\na5=48\n\na6=60\n\na7=84\n\na8=96\n\nSo, the 8th term is 96.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\nThe 8th term of the sequence is calculated by applying the given rule to each subsequent term starting from the 6th term. Using the formula a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2} - a_{n-3}, we find:\n\na6 = 60, a7 = 84, and a8 = 96.\n\n**Answer:** 96\n\nDONE."

The first five terms of the sequence are:\n\n3, 6, 12, 24, 48, ...\n\nHowever, starting from the 6th term, each new term is determined by adding the two previous terms and then subtracting the term that appeared three positions earlier. What is the 8th term of this sequence? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this sequence here, and I need to figure out what the 8th term is. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step. \n\nFirst, the sequence starts with 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, and so on. The first five terms are given, which are 3, 6, 12, 24, 48. Hmm, I notice that each term seems to be doubling the previous term. Let me check:\n\n- Term 1: 3\n- Term 2: 6 (which is 3 * 2)\n- Term 3: 12 (which is 6 * 2)\n- Term 4: 24 (which is 12 * 2)\n- Term 5: 48 (which is 24 * 2)\n\nSo, up to the 5th term, it's clear that each term is twice the previous one. That makes sense. But starting from the 6th term, the rule changes. The problem says that each new term is determined by adding the two previous terms and then subtracting the term that appeared three positions earlier. \n\nWait, let me make sure I understand that correctly. So, starting from term 6, each term is equal to (term n-1 + term n-2) minus term (n-4). Is that right? Let me write that down.\n\nThe rule for n \u2265 6 is:\nTerm(n) = Term(n-1) + Term(n-2) - Term(n-4)\n\nAlright, so let's verify this with the given terms to make sure I got the rule right. \n\nGiven:\nTerm 1: 3\nTerm 2: 6\nTerm 3: 12\nTerm 4: 24\nTerm 5: 48\n\nLet's compute term 6 using the new rule:\nTerm(6) = Term(5) + Term(4) - Term(2)\nTerm(6) = 48 + 24 - 6 = 66\n\nWait, that seems a bit off because if I look at the pattern, the terms are 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, which are all powers of 2 times 3. So, 3, 6=3*2, 12=6*2, 24=12*2, 48=24*2. So, term 5 is 48, term 6 is 66? That breaks the doubling pattern. Maybe I made a mistake in applying the rule.\n\nLet me double-check the rule. The problem says: \"each new term is determined by adding the two previous terms and then subtracting the term that appeared three positions earlier.\" So, for term 6, three positions earlier would be term 3. So, term 6 = term5 + term4 - term3.\n\nYes, that's correct. So term6 = 48 + 24 - 12 = 60.\n\nWait, that's different from what I thought earlier. Let me recalculate:\n\n48 + 24 = 72\n72 - 12 = 60\n\nSo term6 is 60.\n\nBut wait, in the initial thought, I thought term6 would be 66 because I subtracted term2, which is 6. But according to the rule, it's term3 that gets subtracted because it's three positions earlier. So, term3 is 12, so 48 +24=72, minus 12 is 60.\n\nOkay, so term6 is 60.\n\nLet me proceed to term7.\n\nTerm7 = term6 + term5 - term4\nTerm7 = 60 + 48 - 24\n60 +48 is 108, minus24 is 84.\n\nSo term7 is 84.\n\nNow, term8:\n\nTerm8 = term7 + term6 - term5\nTerm8 = 84 + 60 - 48\n84 +60 is 144, minus48 is 96.\n\nSo term8 is 96.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not making any mistakes here. Let me write out all the terms with their indices:\n\nTerm1:3\n\nTerm2:6\n\nTerm3:12\n\nTerm4:24\n\nTerm5:48\n\nTerm6:60 (48+24-12=60)\n\nTerm7:84 (60+48-24=84)\n\nTerm8:96 (84+60-48=96)\n\nHmm, let me check if this makes sense. The terms are increasing, which is good. But let's see if there's a pattern or a recurrence relation that can help us.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write out the terms step by step again to confirm.\n\nStarting from term6:\n\nTerm6 = term5 + term4 - term3 = 48 +24 -12=60\n\nTerm7 = term6 + term5 - term4=60 +48 -24=84\n\nTerm8=term7 + term6 - term5=84 +60 -48=96\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check if the recurrence relation is correct by seeing if the initial terms fit.\n\nWait, let me think about the initial terms. Up to term5, each term is double the previous. So term5 is 48, which is term4*2.\n\nBut term6 is 60, which is not double term5. So the rule changes starting from term6.\n\nI think my calculations are correct. So term8 is 96.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me compute term9 as well to see if the pattern continues.\n\nTerm9=term8 + term7 - term6=96 +84 -60=120\n\nTerm10=term9 + term8 - term7=120 +96 -84=132\n\nTerm11=term10 + term9 - term8=132 +120 -96=156\n\nTerm12=term11 + term10 - term9=156 +132 -120=168\n\nHmm, interesting. The terms are increasing, but not doubling anymore. Instead, each term is the sum of the two previous terms minus the one three terms back.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\nTerm1:3\n\nTerm2:6\n\nTerm3:12\n\nTerm4:24\n\nTerm5:48\n\nTerm6:60\n\nTerm7:84\n\nTerm8:96\n\nTerm9:120\n\nTerm10:132\n\nTerm11:156\n\nTerm12:168\n\nI think I'm confident with this. So the 8th term is 96.\n</think>\n\nThe 8th term of the sequence is calculated by applying the given rule step by step. Starting from term 6, each term is the sum of the two preceding terms minus the term three positions earlier. Following this rule, the 8th term is determined to be 96.\n\n**Answer:** The 8th term is 96.\n\nDONE."

What is the 8th term of this sequence? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out this sequence problem. So, the first five terms are given as 3, 6, 12, 24, 48. And starting from the 6th term, each new term is generated by adding the two previous terms and then subtracting the term that appeared three positions earlier. We need to find the 8th term.\n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand the rule correctly. Starting from the 6th term, each term is calculated as:\n\nTerm\u2099 = Term\u2099\u208b\u2081 + Term\u2099\u208b\u2082 - Term\u2099\u208b\u2083\u208a\u2083\n\nWait, that might not be right. Let me parse the problem again. It says, \"each new term is determined by adding the two previous terms and then subtracting the term that appeared three positions earlier.\"\n\nSo, Term\u2099 = Term\u2099\u208b\u2081 + Term\u2099\u208b\u2082 - Term\u2099\u208b\u2084\n\nWait, no. If it's three positions earlier, that would be Term\u2099\u208b\u2083, right? Because three positions before the current term is Term\u2099\u208b\u2083. Let me check:\n\nIf I'm at Term\u2086, the two previous terms are Term\u2085 and Term\u2084, and the term three positions earlier would be Term\u2083. So, Term\u2086 = Term\u2085 + Term\u2084 - Term\u2083.\n\nSimilarly, Term\u2087 = Term\u2086 + Term\u2085 - Term\u2084, and so on.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the general formula is:\n\nTerm\u2099 = Term\u2099\u208b\u2081 + Term\u2099\u208b\u2082 - Term\u2099\u208b\u2083\n\nWait, hold on. Let me double-check. If the term three positions earlier is Term\u2099\u208b\u2083, then yes, it's subtracted. So the formula is Term\u2099 = Term\u2099\u208b\u2081 + Term\u2099\u208b\u2082 - Term\u2099\u208b\u2083.\n\nBut let me verify with the given terms to make sure.\n\nGiven:\n\nTerm\u2081 = 3\n\nTerm\u2082 = 6\n\nTerm\u2083 = 12\n\nTerm\u2084 = 24\n\nTerm\u2085 = 48\n\nNow, let's compute Term\u2086 using the rule:\n\nTerm\u2086 = Term\u2085 + Term\u2084 - Term\u2083 = 48 + 24 - 12 = 60\n\nWait, but the initial sequence given is up to Term\u2085, which is 48. So Term\u2086 would be 60.\n\nThen, Term\u2087 = Term\u2086 + Term\u2085 - Term\u2084 = 60 + 48 - 24 = 84\n\nTerm\u2088 = Term\u2087 + Term\u2086 - Term\u2085 = 84 + 60 - 48 = 96\n\nSo the 8th term would be 96.\n\nBut let me double-check the calculations step by step to ensure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with Term\u2081 to Term\u2085:\n\n1: 3\n\n2: 6\n\n3: 12\n\n4: 24\n\n5: 48\n\nNow, Term\u2086:\n\nTerm\u2086 = Term\u2085 + Term\u2084 - Term\u2083 = 48 + 24 - 12 = 60\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTerm\u2087:\n\nTerm\u2087 = Term\u2086 + Term\u2085 - Term\u2084 = 60 + 48 - 24 = 84\n\nYes, 60 + 48 is 108, minus 24 is 84.\n\nTerm\u2088:\n\nTerm\u2088 = Term\u2087 + Term\u2086 - Term\u2085 = 84 + 60 - 48 = 96\n\n84 + 60 is 144, minus 48 is 96.\n\nSo, yes, the 8th term is 96.\n\nI think that's correct. Let me just make sure I didn't misinterpret the rule. The problem says \"subtracting the term that appeared three positions earlier.\" So for Term\u2086, the term three positions earlier is Term\u2083, which is 12. So yes, that's subtracted.\n\nSimilarly, for Term\u2087, it's Term\u2084, which is 24, subtracted.\n\nAnd for Term\u2088, it's Term\u2085, which is 48, subtracted.\n\nSo the calculations seem consistent.\n</think>\n\nThe 8th term is calculated by applying the given rule step by step. Starting from Term\u2086, each subsequent term is the sum of the two preceding terms minus the term three positions earlier.\n\nTerm\u2086 = Term\u2085 + Term\u2084 - Term\u2083 = 48 + 24 - 12 = 60  \nTerm\u2087 = Term\u2086 + Term\u2085 - Term\u2084 = 60 + 48 - 24 = 84  \nTerm\u2088 = Term\u2087 + Term\u2086 - Term\u2085 = 84 + 60 - 48 = 96\n\nDONE."

The first five terms of the sequence are:\n\n3, 6, 12, 24, 48, ...\n\nHowever, starting from the 6th term, each new term is determined by adding the two previous terms and then subtracting the term that appeared three positions earlier. What is the 8th term of this sequence? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this sequence here, and I need to find the 8th term. The first five terms are given as 3, 6, 12, 24, 48. Hmm, okay. Let me try to figure out the pattern here.\n\nFirst, I notice that the sequence starts with 3, then doubles each time: 3, 6, 12, 24, 48. That seems like a geometric sequence where each term is multiplied by 2. So, the first five terms are 3, 6, 12, 24, 48. Now, starting from the 6th term, the rule changes. The new term is determined by adding the two previous terms and then subtracting the term that appeared three positions earlier.\n\nLet me write that down to make it clearer. The rule for terms after the 5th is: \n\na\u2099 = a\u2099\u208b\u2081 + a\u2099\u208b\u2082 - a\u2099\u208b\u2084\n\nWait, is that right? Let me check. It says starting from the 6th term, each new term is determined by adding the two previous terms and subtracting the term three positions earlier. So, for term 6, it's a\u2085 + a\u2084 - a\u2082. Let me confirm that with the given terms.\n\nGiven terms:\na\u2081 = 3\na\u2082 = 6\na\u2083 = 12\na\u2084 = 24\na\u2085 = 48\n\nSo, a\u2086 should be a\u2085 + a\u2084 - a\u2082. Let's calculate that:\n\na\u2086 = 48 + 24 - 6 = 66\n\nWait, is that right? 48 + 24 is 72, minus 6 is 66. Okay, so a\u2086 is 66. Then, to find a\u2087, I need a\u2086 + a\u2085 - a\u2083.\n\na\u2087 = 66 + 48 - 12 = 102\n\nSimilarly, a\u2088 would be a\u2087 + a\u2086 - a\u2084.\n\na\u2088 = 102 + 66 - 24 = 144\n\nWait, let me double-check these calculations step by step to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nStarting with a\u2086:\na\u2085 = 48\na\u2084 = 24\na\u2082 = 6\nSo, 48 + 24 = 72; 72 - 6 = 66. That seems correct.\n\nThen a\u2087:\na\u2086 = 66\na\u2085 = 48\na\u2083 = 12\nSo, 66 + 48 = 114; 114 - 12 = 102. That adds up.\n\nFinally, a\u2088:\na\u2087 = 102\na\u2086 = 66\na\u2084 = 24\nSo, 102 + 66 = 168; 168 - 24 = 144. Yep, that checks out.\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I'm applying the rule correctly. The problem says \"subtracting the term that appeared three positions earlier.\" So for a\u2086, it's three positions before a\u2086, which is a\u2083. For a\u2087, it's a\u2084, and for a\u2088, it's a\u2085. Wait, hold on, is that correct?\n\nWait, maybe I miscounted the positions. Let me think about the indexing. If a\u2086 is the 6th term, then three positions earlier would be a\u2083. Similarly, a\u2087 would subtract a\u2084, and a\u2088 would subtract a\u2085. Yeah, that's what I did earlier. So, the calculation seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to write out the sequence with the new terms:\n\na\u2081 = 3\na\u2082 = 6\na\u2083 = 12\na\u2084 = 24\na\u2085 = 48\na\u2086 = 48 + 24 - 6 = 66\na\u2087 = 66 + 48 - 12 = 102\na\u2088 = 102 + 66 - 24 = 144\n\nSo, the 8th term is 144. That seems straightforward, but let me see if there's a pattern or if I can find a recurrence relation.\n\nLooking back, the initial terms are doubling each time, but starting from a\u2086, the rule changes. It's a combination of the two previous terms and subtracting a term from three positions back. This might create a different pattern, but in this case, the numbers are increasing rapidly.\n\nLet me see if this rule continues beyond the 8th term to spot any patterns or errors. For example, a\u2089 would be a\u2088 + a\u2087 - a\u2085.\n\na\u2089 = 144 + 102 - 48 = 198\n\na\u2081\u2080 = a\u2089 + a\u2088 - a\u2086 = 198 + 144 - 66 = 276\n\nHmm, okay, so the sequence is continuing to grow. But since the question only asks for the 8th term, I think I've got the answer.\n\nJust to recap, the steps were:\n\n1. Recognize the initial geometric sequence with a common ratio of 2.\n2. Apply the new rule for terms starting from a\u2086: a\u2099 = a\u2099\u208b\u2081 + a\u2099\u208b\u2082 - a\u2099\u208b\u2084\n3. Calculate each subsequent term step by step.\n4. Verify each calculation to ensure accuracy.\n\nI don't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I feel confident that the 8th term is 144.\n</think>\n\nThe 8th term of the sequence is found by applying the given rule to each term starting from the 6th. Calculating step by step:\n\na\u2086 = a\u2085 + a\u2084 - a\u2082 = 48 + 24 - 6 = 66  \na\u2087 = a\u2086 + a\u2085 - a\u2083 = 66 + 48 - 12 = 102  \na\u2088 = a\u2087 + a\u2086 - a\u2084 = 102 + 66 - 24 = 144  \n\n**Answer:** 144  \nDONE."
