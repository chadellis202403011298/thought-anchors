  "question": "Consider a sequence where each term is generated by a specific rule. The first five terms of the sequence are:\n\n3, 6, 12, 24, 48, ...\n\nHowever, starting from the 6th term, each new term is determined by adding the two previous terms and then subtracting the term that appeared three positions earlier. What is the 8th term of this sequence?",
  "answer": "To solve this problem, I need to understand the recursive pattern and apply it step by step.\n\nGiven sequence: 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, ...\n\nThe rule starting from the 6th term is:\nTerm_n = Term_(n-1) + Term_(n-2) - Term_(n-3)\n\nFirst, I'll identify the terms we know:\nTerm_1 = 3\nTerm_2 = 6\nTerm_3 = 12\nTerm_4 = 24\nTerm_5 = 48\n\nNow I'll calculate the 6th term using the recursive rule:\nTerm_6 = Term_5 + Term_4 - Term_3\nTerm_6 = 48 + 24 - 12 = 60\n\nNext, the 7th term:\nTerm_7 = Term_6 + Term_5 - Term_4\nTerm_7 = 60 + 48 - 24 = 84\n\nFinally, the 8th term:\nTerm_8 = Term_7 + Term_6 - Term_5\nTerm_8 = 84 + 60 - 48 = 96\n\nTherefore, the 8th term of the sequence is 96."
