  "question": "A local library wants to increase engagement among teenagers, as statistics show this demographic rarely visits the library. The library director has hired you as a design thinking consultant to address this challenge. Given the following research insights from initial interviews, identify which approach would be most aligned with design thinking principles and why:\n\n1. Several teens mentioned they find the library 'boring' and 'outdated'\n2. Many teens said they prefer digital content to physical books\n3. Teens reported having limited free time due to school and extracurricular activities\n4. Several mentioned they would visit if their friends were there\n\nOptions:\nA. Create a marketing campaign highlighting the library's extensive book collection\nB. Install new computers with faster internet access\nC. Prototype a dedicated teen space with flexible furniture, digital resources, and a cafe area where socializing is encouraged\nD. Extend library hours to be open later in the evenings",
  "answer": "The correct answer is C: Prototype a dedicated teen space with flexible furniture, digital resources, and a cafe area where socializing is encouraged.\n\nReasoning through design thinking principles:\n\n1. Empathize: The research insights show teens find the library boring and outdated, prefer digital content, have limited time, and are motivated by social opportunities. Option C directly addresses these pain points and user needs identified in the empathy phase.\n\n2. Define: The problem isn't just about getting teens into the library building; it's about creating an experience that appeals to them. Option C correctly reframes the problem as creating a relevant space rather than just marketing existing resources or making minor adjustments.\n\n3. Ideate: Option C represents a holistic solution that combines multiple insights rather than focusing on just one aspect of the problem.\n\n4. Prototype: This option explicitly mentions creating a prototype, which is a core design thinking principle - testing ideas before full implementation.\n\n5. Test: A dedicated space can be modified based on ongoing feedback, allowing for iteration.\n\nThe other options are less aligned with design thinking principles:\n- Option A ignores the insight that teens prefer digital content and find the library outdated\n- Option B addresses only the digital preference without considering the social aspect\n- Option D addresses time constraints but ignores the other key insights about why teens don't find the library appealing\n\nOption C is superior because it holistically addresses multiple user needs identified in the research and follows the design thinking process of creating innovative solutions based on user insights."
