  "question": "Four friends live in a small town where all streets form a grid pattern with coordinates measured in blocks. Alex lives at coordinates (3, 5), Blake lives at (8, 5), Carmen lives at (8, 2), and Dana lives at (3, 2). They want to meet at a location that minimizes the total distance all four friends need to walk, assuming they can only walk along the streets (i.e., using Manhattan distance). At which coordinates should they meet, and what will be the total distance walked by all four friends combined?",
  "answer": "To solve this problem, we need to find the point that minimizes the sum of Manhattan distances from all four points.\n\nThe Manhattan distance between two points (x\u2081, y\u2081) and (x\u2082, y\u2082) is |x\u2082 - x\u2081| + |y\u2082 - y\u2081|.\n\nFirst, let's identify the coordinates of each person:\n- Alex: (3, 5)\n- Blake: (8, 5)\n- Carmen: (8, 2)\n- Dana: (3, 2)\n\nFor Manhattan distance in a grid, we can actually consider the x-coordinates and y-coordinates separately.\n\nFor the x-coordinate, we want to minimize the sum:\n|x - 3| + |x - 8| + |x - 8| + |x - 3|\n\nA key insight in Manhattan distance problems is that the optimal meeting point is at the median of the coordinates. When we list the x-coordinates in order, we get:\n3, 3, 8, 8\n\nThe median could be any point between 3 and 8 (inclusive). Let's choose x = 5.5 for now.\n\nSimilarly, for the y-coordinate, we want to minimize:\n|y - 5| + |y - 5| + |y - 2| + |y - 2|\n\nThe y-coordinates in order are:\n2, 2, 5, 5\n\nThe median could be any point between 2 and 5 (inclusive). Let's choose y = 3.5 for now.\n\nHowever, since we're working on a grid where coordinates are whole numbers, we should pick integer coordinates. Any point with x-coordinate between 3 and 8 (inclusive) and y-coordinate between 2 and 5 (inclusive) will minimize the total distance.\n\nLet's choose the point (5, 3) as our meeting location.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total Manhattan distance:\n\nFor Alex at (3, 5):\n|5 - 3| + |3 - 5| = 2 + 2 = 4 blocks\n\nFor Blake at (8, 5):\n|5 - 8| + |3 - 5| = 3 + 2 = 5 blocks\n\nFor Carmen at (8, 2):\n|5 - 8| + |3 - 2| = 3 + 1 = 4 blocks\n\nFor Dana at (3, 2):\n|5 - 3| + |3 - 2| = 2 + 1 = 3 blocks\n\nTotal distance = 4 + 5 + 4 + 3 = 16 blocks\n\nTherefore, they should meet at coordinates (5, 3), and the total distance walked by all four friends will be 16 blocks.\n\nNote: Any point with integer coordinates in the rectangle bounded by (3,2), (3,5), (8,5), and (8,2) would give the same total distance of 16 blocks."
