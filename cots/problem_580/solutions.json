(A \u2229 B) \u222a C\n2. A \u2229 (B \u222a C)\n3. Are the results from parts 1 and 2 equal? If so, does this demonstrate a general property of sets, or is it just a coincidence for these particular sets? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I've got this problem here with three sets A, B, and C, and I need to figure out two different operations involving their intersections and unions, and then compare the results. Let's take it step by step.\n\nFirst, let me write down the sets to make sure I have them clear:\n\n- Set A = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}\n- Set B = {2, 3, 5, 7}\n- Set C = {1, 2, 4, 7, 9}\n\nOkay, so part 1 asks for (A \u2229 B) \u222a C. Let me break that down. I need to first find the intersection of A and B, which means elements common to both A and B. Then, I'll take that result and union it with set C.\n\nStarting with A \u2229 B. Let's see, A has 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 and B has 2, 3, 5, 7. So the common elements are 3, 5, and 7. Therefore, A \u2229 B = {3, 5, 7}.\n\nNow, I need to take this set and union it with C. Set C is {1, 2, 4, 7, 9}. So, combining {3, 5, 7} with {1, 2, 4, 7, 9}, I should include all elements from both sets. Let's list them out:\n\nFrom {3, 5, 7}: 3, 5, 7\n\nFrom C: 1, 2, 4, 7, 9\n\nCombining these, I get {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}. Wait, is 7 included twice? No, in sets, duplicates are ignored, so it's just {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}.\n\nOkay, so (A \u2229 B) \u222a C = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}.\n\nMoving on to part 2, which is A \u2229 (B \u222a C). This means I first need to find the union of B and C, and then intersect that result with A.\n\nLet's start with B \u222a C. Set B is {2, 3, 5, 7} and C is {1, 2, 4, 7, 9}. So, combining these, the union includes all elements from both sets. Let's list them out:\n\nFrom B: 2, 3, 5, 7\n\nFrom C: 1, 2, 4, 7, 9\n\nPutting them together, we get {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}. Hmm, that's the same as the previous result.\n\nNow, intersecting this with A. Set A is {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}. So, the intersection would be the elements common to both A and {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}. Let's see:\n\nLooking at each element:\n\n1: Yes, in both\n2: Not in A\n3: Yes\n4: Not in A\n5: Yes\n7: Yes\n9: Yes\n\nSo, the intersection A \u2229 (B \u222a C) is {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}, which is exactly set A itself.\n\nWait a minute, that's interesting. So, (A \u2229 B) \u222a C is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}, and A \u2229 (B \u222a C) is {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}.\n\nNow, part 3 asks if these results are equal. Looking at them:\n\n- First result: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}\n- Second result: {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}\n\nThey are not equal because the first one has elements 2 and 4 that the second one doesn't. So, no, the results are not equal.\n\nBut why is that? Is there a general property here or is it just a coincidence? Let me think about the distributive laws of sets. I remember that in general, distribution doesn't always hold, meaning that (A \u2229 B) \u222a C is not necessarily equal to A \u2229 (B \u222a C). However, in some cases, especially when the operations are distributive over each other, they might coincide.\n\nIn this specific case, it seems that the order in which we perform the operations affects the outcome because when we first took the intersection and then the union, we included elements from C that weren't in A, whereas when we took the union first, some elements from B that weren't in A were excluded in the intersection.\n\nSo, it's not a general property that these two expressions are equal; it's just a coincidence here because of the specific elements in the sets. Therefore, the equality of these two operations isn't guaranteed but happened to occur in this particular case.\n</think>\n\n1. (A \u2229 B) \u222a C = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}\n2. A \u2229 (B \u222a C) = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}\n3. No, the results are not equal. This demonstrates that the distributive law for sets does not always hold, making it a coincidence for these specific sets.\n\nDONE."

End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: Consider three sets A, B, and C defined as follows:\nA = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}\nB = {2, 3, 5, 7}\nC = {1, 2, 4, 7, 9}\n\nDetermine the following:\n1. (A \u2229 B) \u222a C\n2. A \u2229 (B \u222a C)\n3. Are the results from parts 1 and 2 equal? If so, does this demonstrate a general property of sets, or is it just a coincidence for these particular sets? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I've got this problem here about three sets A, B, and C. Let me write them down first so I can see what I'm dealing with.\n\nSet A is {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}. Okay, that's straightforward. Set B is {2, 3, 5, 7}. And set C is {1, 2, 4, 7, 9}. Got that.\n\nNow, the problem has three parts. Let me take them one at a time.\n\n**1. (A \u2229 B) \u222a C**\n\nHmm, okay. So first, I need to find the intersection of A and B, which is A \u2229 B. Intersection means the elements that are in both A and B. Let me look at A and B.\n\nSet A: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9\nSet B: 2, 3, 5, 7\n\nSo, the common elements are 3, 5, and 7. That means A \u2229 B = {3, 5, 7}.\n\nNow, I need to take that result and union it with set C. Union means combining all the elements from both sets, without duplicates. So, let's see:\n\nA \u2229 B = {3, 5, 7}\nSet C = {1, 2, 4, 7, 9}\n\nSo, {3, 5, 7} \u222a {1, 2, 4, 7, 9}. Let me list them out:\n\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9.\n\nWait, is that all? Let me double-check. From A \u2229 B: 3,5,7. From C: 1,2,4,7,9. So combining them: 1,2,3,4,5,7,9. Yep, that's seven elements.\n\nSo, (A \u2229 B) \u222a C = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}.\n\n**2. A \u2229 (B \u222a C)**\n\nAlright, now the second part is A intersected with the union of B and C. So first, I need to find B \u222a C.\n\nSet B = {2, 3, 5, 7}\nSet C = {1, 2, 4, 7, 9}\n\nSo, union of B and C would include all elements from both sets. Let's list them:\n\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9.\n\nWait, that's the same as the first part. Interesting. So B \u222a C = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}.\n\nNow, intersect this with A. So A is {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}. The intersection would be the elements common to both A and B \u222a C.\n\nLooking at A: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9.\n\nAnd B \u222a C is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}.\n\nSo, the common elements are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9.\n\nTherefore, A \u2229 (B \u222a C) = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}.\n\n**3. Are the results from parts 1 and 2 equal?**\n\nLooking back:\n\nPart 1: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}\n\nPart 2: {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}\n\nSo, no, they are not equal. Part 1 has more elements, specifically 2 and 4, whereas Part 2 has fewer elements because it's the intersection.\n\nWait, but hold on. Did I do that right? Because in Part 1, it's (A \u2229 B) \u222a C, which is {3,5,7} \u222a C, and in Part 2, it's A \u2229 (B \u222a C). It's interesting that both of these unions resulted in the same set as B \u222a C, but their intersections with A are different.\n\nBut in any case, the results are not equal. So, the answer to the third question is no, they are not equal. But wait, the problem says \"Are the results from parts 1 and 2 equal?\" So, no, they are not equal.\n\nBut then it also asks, \"If so, does this demonstrate a general property of sets, or is it just a coincidence for these particular sets?\"\n\nHmm, so since they are not equal, it's not demonstrating a general property. But wait, in general, is there a property where (A \u2229 B) \u222a C might equal A \u2229 (B \u222a C)? Or is this just a coincidence here?\n\nLet me think. In general, set operations can have different results based on the order of operations. The distributive law says that A \u2229 (B \u222a C) = (A \u2229 B) \u222a (A \u2229 C). So, in this case, (A \u2229 B) \u222a (A \u2229 C) vs (A \u2229 B) \u222a C.\n\nWait, so (A \u2229 B) \u222a C is not necessarily equal to (A \u2229 B) \u222a (A \u2229 C). Because in the second case, you're only adding A \u2229 B, not A \u2229 C.\n\nSo, in our case, let's see:\n\n(A \u2229 B) \u222a C is {3,5,7} \u222a {1,2,4,7,9} = {1,2,3,4,5,7,9}\n\nA \u2229 (B \u222a C) is {1,3,5,7,9}\n\nBut if we compute (A \u2229 B) \u222a (A \u2229 C), that would be {3,5,7} \u222a {1,5,9} = {1,3,5,7,9}, which is the same as A \u2229 (B \u222a C).\n\nSo, in this case, (A \u2229 B) \u222a (A \u2229 C) equals A \u2229 (B \u222a C). But (A \u2229 B) \u222a C is different because it's adding C without intersecting with A.\n\nSo, in general, (A \u2229 B) \u222a C is not equal to A \u2229 (B \u222a C) unless C is a subset of A. Because if C is a subset of A, then (A \u2229 B) \u222a C would still be A \u2229 (B \u222a C). Let's see:\n\nIf C is a subset of A, then C \u2229 A = C. So, (A \u2229 B) \u222a C would be (A \u2229 B) \u222a (A \u2229 C) because C is already in A.\n\nWait, but in our case, C is not a subset of A. C has elements 2 and 4, which are not in A. So, (A \u2229 B) \u222a C includes those extra elements from C not in A \u2229 B.\n\nBut A \u2229 (B \u222a C) only includes elements common to A and either B or C. So, since C has elements not in A, those don't get included in A \u2229 (B \u222a C).\n\nSo, in general, unless C is a subset of A, these two operations will not be equal.\n\nTherefore, the fact that in this case, (A \u2229 B) \u222a C and A \u2229 (B \u222a C) are not equal is not a coincidence. It's because C is not entirely contained within A.\n\nIf C were a subset of A, then (A \u2229 B) \u222a C would equal A \u2229 (B \u222a C). Because adding C to A \u2229 B would be the same as intersecting A with the union of B and C.\n\nBut since C has elements not in A, those extra elements get included in the first operation but not the second.\n\nSo, it's not a coincidence; it demonstrates the general property that when you have (A \u2229 B) \u222a C, if C is not a subset of A, it will include elements not present in A \u2229 (B \u222a C).\n\nAlternatively, if C is a subset of A, then (A \u2229 B) \u222a C equals A \u2229 (B \u222a C). So, it depends on the relationship between C and A.\n\nIn summary:\n\n1. (A \u2229 B) \u222a C = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}\n\n2. A \u2229 (B \u222a C) = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}\n\n3. They are not equal, and this is not a coincidence but demonstrates the general property that (A \u2229 B) \u222a C and A \u2229 (B \u222a C) are equal only if C is a subset of A.\n</think>\n\n1. (A \u2229 B) \u222a C = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}\n2. A \u2229 (B \u222a C) = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}\n3. They are not equal, and this illustrates the general property that (A \u2229 B) \u222a C and A \u2229 (B \u222a C) are only equal when C is a subset of A.\n\nDONE."

If so, does this demonstrate a general property of sets, or is it just a coincidence for these particular sets? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this problem with three sets: A, B, and C. Let me write them down first to make sure I have them right.\n\nSet A is {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}. Okay, that's straightforward. Set B is {2, 3, 5, 7}, and set C is {1, 2, 4, 7, 9}. Got that.\n\nNow, the first part is to find (A \u2229 B) \u222a C. Hmm, okay. Let me remember the order of operations here. Intersection comes before union, and parentheses matter. So first, I need to find A \u2229 B, which is the set of elements that are in both A and B. Let me list out the elements of A and B to see where they overlap.\n\nA has 1, 3, 5, 7, 9. B has 2, 3, 5, 7. So, looking for common elements: 3 is in both, 5 is in both, and 7 is in both. So A \u2229 B is {3, 5, 7}. Got that.\n\nNow, I need to take that result and union it with set C. So, {3, 5, 7} \u222a {1, 2, 4, 7, 9}. Let me combine these. Start with 3, then 5, then 7. Now, from C, add 1, 2, 4, and 9. So putting it all together, the union should be {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}. Let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything. 1 is from C, 2 is from C, 3 is from A \u2229 B, 4 is from C, 5 is from A \u2229 B, 7 is from both, and 9 is from C. Yep, that seems right.\n\nOkay, so part 1 is done. The result is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}.\n\nMoving on to part 2: A \u2229 (B \u222a C). Again, order of operations is important here. I need to compute B \u222a C first and then intersect that with A.\n\nLet me find B \u222a C. Set B is {2, 3, 5, 7}, and set C is {1, 2, 4, 7, 9}. So combining these, we have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9. So B \u222a C is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}. Wait a minute, that's the same as part 1's result. Interesting.\n\nNow, I need to find A \u2229 (B \u222a C). Since A is {1, 3, 5, 7, 9} and B \u222a C is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}, the intersection will be the elements common to both. Let me go through each element in A and see if it's in B \u222a C.\n\n1 is in both, 3 is in both, 5 is in both, 7 is in both, and 9 is in both. So A \u2229 (B \u222a C) is {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}. That's exactly set A itself. Hmm, that's interesting because normally, the intersection of A with the union of B and C might not be A, but in this case, it is.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Since B \u222a C includes all elements from B and C, and A is a subset of B \u222a C because all elements of A are in B or C. So, yes, A is entirely contained within B \u222a C, hence their intersection is A itself. That makes sense.\n\nSo, part 2's result is {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}.\n\nNow, part 3 asks if the results from parts 1 and 2 are equal. Let me compare them. Part 1 was {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9} and part 2 was {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}. So, part 1 has more elements: 2 and 4 are in part 1 but not in part 2. Therefore, they are not equal.\n\nBut wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check part 1. (A \u2229 B) is {3,5,7}, and then \u222a C which is {1,2,4,7,9}. So, combining those, yes, 1,2,3,4,5,7,9. So part 1 is correct. Part 2 is A \u2229 (B \u222a C) which is A because A is a subset of B \u222a C. So yes, they are not equal.\n\nSo, the results are not equal. But the question also asks if this demonstrates a general property or is it just a coincidence. Let me think about set theory.\n\nI remember that in general, (A \u2229 B) \u222a C is not necessarily equal to A \u2229 (B \u222a C). In fact, these are known as the distributive laws, and they don't always hold unless certain conditions are met, like absorption laws or something else. In this case, since (A \u2229 B) \u222a C and A \u2229 (B \u222a C) are not equal, it shows that the distributive law doesn't hold in general for sets. Wait, no, actually, the distributive law in lattice theory holds, but in set theory without additional constraints, it might not.\n\nWait, no, in set theory, the distributive law does hold: (A \u2229 B) \u222a C = A \u2229 (B \u222a C). But wait, that contradicts what I just saw here. So maybe I'm confusing something.\n\nWait, no, in set theory, the distributive law is (A \u2229 B) \u222a C = A \u2229 (B \u222a C). So in that case, they should be equal. But in my calculation, they weren't. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, let me go back. Let me re-calculate part 1 and part 2 carefully.\n\nPart 1: (A \u2229 B) \u222a C.\n\nA \u2229 B is {3,5,7}.\n\nC is {1,2,4,7,9}.\n\nSo union is {1,2,3,4,5,7,9}. That seems correct.\n\nPart 2: A \u2229 (B \u222a C).\n\nB \u222a C is {1,2,3,4,5,7,9}.\n\nA is {1,3,5,7,9}.\n\nIntersection is {1,3,5,7,9}. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but according to set theory, (A \u2229 B) \u222a C should equal A \u2229 (B \u222a C). But in this case, they are not equal because part 1 is {1,2,3,4,5,7,9} and part 2 is {1,3,5,7,9}.\n\nSo that suggests that either my understanding is wrong or there's a mistake in the problem. Wait, no, perhaps I'm confusing union and intersection.\n\nWait, let me recall: the distributive law states that union distributes over intersection, so (A \u2229 B) \u222a C = A \u2229 (B \u222a C). So they should be equal.\n\nBut in my calculation, they are not. So I must have messed up the calculation somewhere.\n\nWait, let me check part 1 again.\n\nA \u2229 B is {3,5,7}. Then \u222a C: {1,2,4,7,9}. So combining these, 1,2,3,4,5,7,9. Correct.\n\nPart 2: B \u222a C is {1,2,3,4,5,7,9}. Then A \u2229 that is {1,3,5,7,9}. So part 1 is {1,2,3,4,5,7,9}, part 2 is {1,3,5,7,9}. So they are not equal because part 1 has 2 and 4 which are not in part 2.\n\nBut according to the distributive law, they should be equal. So where is the mistake?\n\nWait, no, the distributive law is (A \u2229 B) \u222a C = A \u2229 (B \u222a C). So in this case, (A \u2229 B) \u222a C is {1,2,3,4,5,7,9}, and A \u2229 (B \u222a C) is {1,3,5,7,9}. So they are not equal. Therefore, the distributive law does not hold in set theory? But I thought it did.\n\nWait, no, the distributive law in set theory is that union distributes over intersection, so (A \u2229 B) \u222a C = A \u2229 (B \u222a C). So in that case, they should be equal. But in my calculation, they are not. So I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me check again.\n\nPart 1: (A \u2229 B) \u222a C.\n\nA \u2229 B is {3,5,7}.\n\nC is {1,2,4,7,9}.\n\nSo union is {1,2,3,4,5,7,9}.\n\nPart 2: A \u2229 (B \u222a C).\n\nB \u222a C is {1,2,3,4,5,7,9}.\n\nA is {1,3,5,7,9}.\n\nIntersection is {1,3,5,7,9}.\n\nWait, but according to the distributive law, they should be equal. So why are they not?\n\nWait, no, maybe I'm misunderstanding the distributive law. Let me look it up in my mind. The distributive law states that for any sets A, B, C, (A \u2229 B) \u222a C = A \u2229 (B \u222a C). So according to that, they should be equal.\n\nBut in my calculation, they are not. So I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, no, in reality, the distributive law in set theory does hold, but only if certain conditions are met. Wait, no, it's a fundamental law. Maybe I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, let's see: (A \u2229 B) \u222a C should include all elements that are in A \u2229 B or in C.\n\nA \u2229 B is {3,5,7}, C is {1,2,4,7,9}.\n\nSo (A \u2229 B) \u222a C is {1,2,3,4,5,7,9}.\n\nOn the other hand, A \u2229 (B \u222a C) is A intersected with everything in B or C. Since A is {1,3,5,7,9}, and B \u222a C is {1,2,3,4,5,7,9}, their intersection is {1,3,5,7,9}.\n\nBut according to the distributive law, they should be equal. So why are they not?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the distributive law with something else. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no, the distributive law is specifically that (A \u2229 B) \u222a C = A \u2229 (B \u222a C). So if I have (A \u2229 B) \u222a C, that should equal A \u2229 (B \u222a C). But in this case, they are not equal, which suggests that the distributive law does not hold in set theory. But that can't be right because I've heard that set theory is a lattice and the distributive law does hold.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the notation. Let me check the order of operations again. Is it (A \u2229 B) \u222a C or A \u2229 (B \u222a C)? In part 1, it's (A \u2229 B) \u222a C, and in part 2, it's A \u2229 (B \u222a C). So they are both correctly applying the distributive law.\n\nBut in my calculation, they are not equal. So perhaps the distributive law doesn't hold in set theory? That can't be right.\n\nWait, I think I'm confusing the distributive law with something else. Let me check an example. Suppose A = {1,2}, B = {2,3}, C = {3,4}.\n\nThen (A \u2229 B) \u222a C = ( {2} ) \u222a {3,4} = {2,3,4}.\n\nA \u2229 (B \u222a C) = {1,2} \u2229 ({2,3} \u222a {3,4}) = {1,2} \u2229 {2,3,4} = {2}.\n\nWait, in this case, (A \u2229 B) \u222a C is {2,3,4}, and A \u2229 (B \u222a C) is {2}. They are not equal. So the distributive law does not hold in set theory. That's surprising.\n\nBut I thought set theory was a lattice with distributive laws. Maybe I'm wrong. Let me see.\n\nWait, no, I think in lattice theory, the distributive law does hold, but in set theory, which is a more general structure, it doesn't necessarily hold. So in set theory, the distributive law is not always true.\n\nWait, that makes sense now. So in some lattices, like Boolean algebras, the distributive law holds, but in set theory, which is a more general lattice, it doesn't necessarily hold. So in my example, it didn't hold, and in the given problem, it didn't hold either.\n\nSo, in this problem, the results are not equal, which shows that the distributive law does not hold in set theory, at least not in general. So it's not a coincidence; it's because set theory doesn't satisfy the distributive law in all cases.\n\nTherefore, the answer to part 3 is that the results are not equal, and this demonstrates that the distributive law does not hold in set theory, not just for these particular sets, but in general.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought set theory is a lattice. Maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me check my notes.\n\nUpon reflection, I recall that set theory does not satisfy the distributive law in general. For example, the set of subsets of a set does form a Boolean algebra, which is a lattice where the distributive law holds. However, when dealing with arbitrary sets, the distributive law may not hold. So in this problem, it's just a coincidence that the results are different, and it shows that in general, the distributive law doesn't hold for sets, only for certain subsets or in specific structures like Boolean algebras.\n\nSo, to sum up:\n\n1. (A \u2229 B) \u222a C = {1,2,3,4,5,7,9}\n\n2. A \u2229 (B \u222a C) = {1,3,5,7,9}\n\n3. They are not equal, and this demonstrates that the distributive law does not hold in set theory in general, rather than just being a coincidence for these specific sets.\n\nI think that's it.\n</think>\n\n1. (A \u2229 B) \u222a C = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}\n\n2. A \u2229 (B \u222a C) = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}\n\n3. The results are not equal, demonstrating that the distributive law does not hold in set theory in general.\n\nDONE."

(A \u2229 B) \u222a C\n2. A \u2229 (B \u222a C)\n3. Are the results from parts 1 and 2 equal? If so, does this demonstrate a general property of sets, or is it just a coincidence for these particular sets? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I've got this problem with three sets A, B, and C, and I need to figure out two operations involving them and then determine if the results are equal. Let me take it step by step because I'm still getting comfortable with set operations.\n\nFirst, let me write down what each set is:\n\nA = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}\nB = {2, 3, 5, 7}\nC = {1, 2, 4, 7, 9}\n\nOkay, so the first thing to do is to tackle part 1: (A \u2229 B) \u222a C.\n\nI remember that the intersection of two sets, denoted by \u2229, contains elements that are in both sets. So, A \u2229 B would be the elements common to both A and B.\n\nLooking at A and B:\n\nA has 1, 3, 5, 7, 9.\nB has 2, 3, 5, 7.\n\nSo, the common elements are 3, 5, and 7. That means A \u2229 B = {3, 5, 7}.\n\nNow, I need to take this result and perform a union with set C. The union (\u222a) of two sets includes all elements that are in either set. So, I need to combine {3, 5, 7} with C.\n\nSet C is {1, 2, 4, 7, 9}.\n\nPutting them together, we have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9. So, (A \u2229 B) \u222a C = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}.\n\nAlright, that's part 1 done. Now, part 2: A \u2229 (B \u222a C).\n\nThis time, the operation is a bit different. The parentheses matter here. First, I need to compute B \u222a C, and then intersect that result with A.\n\nSo, let's find B \u222a C first.\n\nSet B is {2, 3, 5, 7}, and C is {1, 2, 4, 7, 9}.\n\nThe union of B and C includes all elements from both sets. So, combining them, we get {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}.\n\nNow, intersect this with A. A is {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}.\n\nSo, A \u2229 (B \u222a C) would be the elements common to both A and {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}. \n\nLooking at A, all its elements are in the union of B and C except for 1, 3, 5, 7, 9. Wait, no, actually, the union includes all those elements. So, the intersection is just A itself because A is entirely contained within the union.\n\nTherefore, A \u2229 (B \u222a C) = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}, which is set A.\n\nHmm, interesting. So, in part 1, the result was {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}, and in part 2, it's {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}.\n\nSo, the results are not equal. Part 1 has more elements: 2 and 4, which aren't in A, but they are in C. Part 2 is exactly A.\n\nNow, the third part asks if these results are equal. They're not, as shown. But why is that? Is there a general property here, or is it just a coincidence?\n\nI recall something about distributive laws in set theory. The distributive law states that for any sets A, B, C, the following hold:\n\nA \u2229 (B \u222a C) = (A \u2229 B) \u222a (A \u2229 C)\nA \u222a (B \u2229 C) = (A \u222a B) \u2229 (A \u222a C)\n\nSo, in this problem, part 2 is applying the distributive law, breaking down the intersection over the union. Part 1 is performing the intersection first and then the union, which doesn't distribute.\n\nThis means that in general, (A \u2229 B) \u222a C is not necessarily equal to A \u2229 (B \u222a C). The order of operations matters here. Depending on where the parentheses are, the results can differ.\n\nIn our case, part 1 is (A \u2229 B) \u222a C, which equals {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}. Part 2 is A \u2229 (B \u222a C), which equals A. Since A is a subset of the union B \u222a C, the intersection is just A.\n\nSo, the difference arises because in part 1, we're taking the intersection of A and B first, which removes some elements from B, and then uniting with C, which adds back elements from C not in A \u2229 B. In part 2, we're uniting B and C first, which includes all elements from both, and then intersecting with A, resulting in just A.\n\nThis shows that the placement of parentheses significantly affects the outcome, and it's not just a coincidence. It's illustrating the distributive law's role in set operations.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n1. (A \u2229 B) \u222a C = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}\n2. A \u2229 (B \u222a C) = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}\n3. They are not equal, and this demonstrates the distributive law in set operations, highlighting how the order of operations affects the result.\n</think>\n\n1. (A \u2229 B) \u222a C = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}\n2. A \u2229 (B \u222a C) = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}\n3. The results are not equal. This demonstrates the distributive law in set operations, where the order of applying union and intersection affects the outcome.\n\nDONE."

If so, does this demonstrate a general property of sets, or is it just a coincidence for these particular sets? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this problem with three sets A, B, and C. I need to find two specific set operations and then determine if the results are equal. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me write down what each set contains to make sure I have them right.\n\nSet A: {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}\nSet B: {2, 3, 5, 7}\nSet C: {1, 2, 4, 7, 9}\n\nOkay, so now I need to find (A \u2229 B) \u222a C and A \u2229 (B \u222a C). Let me recall what each operation means.\n\nThe intersection (A \u2229 B) includes all elements that are in both A and B. The union (\u222a) includes all elements that are in either of the sets. For the second part, A \u2229 (B \u222a C) is the intersection of A with the union of B and C.\n\nLet me start with the first part: (A \u2229 B) \u222a C.\n\nFirst, find A \u2229 B. That is, elements common to both A and B.\n\nLooking at A: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9\nLooking at B: 2, 3, 5, 7\n\nSo the common elements are 3, 5, 7.\n\nTherefore, A \u2229 B = {3, 5, 7}\n\nNext, I need to take the union of this result with set C.\n\nSet C is {1, 2, 4, 7, 9}\n\nSo, (A \u2229 B) \u222a C = {3, 5, 7} \u222a {1, 2, 4, 7, 9}\n\nTo union these, I combine all elements from both sets, removing duplicates.\n\nSo that would be {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}\n\nAlright, that's the first part done.\n\nNow, moving on to the second part: A \u2229 (B \u222a C)\n\nFirst, find B \u222a C.\n\nSet B: {2, 3, 5, 7}\nSet C: {1, 2, 4, 7, 9}\n\nThe union of B and C includes all elements from both sets.\n\nSo B \u222a C = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}\n\nNow, I need to find the intersection of A with this union.\n\nSet A: {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}\nB \u222a C: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}\n\nThe common elements are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9.\n\nTherefore, A \u2229 (B \u222a C) = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}\n\nWait a minute, that's interesting. Let me double-check.\n\nFirst, for (A \u2229 B) \u222a C, I got {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}. And for A \u2229 (B \u222a C), I got {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}.\n\nSo, they are not equal. The first result has 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, whereas the second has only 1, 3, 5, 7, 9.\n\nTherefore, the results are not equal.\n\nNow, the third question: Are the results from parts 1 and 2 equal? Since they are not, it means that in general, (A \u2229 B) \u222a C is not necessarily equal to A \u2229 (B \u222a C). It's just a coincidence for these specific sets because in this case, they ended up being equal, but in general, they don't have to be.\n\nWait, actually, hold on. Let me think again. Did I make a mistake in my calculations?\n\nLet me re-examine both parts.\n\nFirst part: (A \u2229 B) \u222a C\n\nA \u2229 B = {3, 5, 7}\nC = {1, 2, 4, 7, 9}\n\nUnion of these: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9} \u2013 that's correct.\n\nSecond part: A \u2229 (B \u222a C)\n\nB \u222a C = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}\nA = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}\n\nIntersection: elements common to both, which are {1, 3, 5, 7, 9} \u2013 that's correct.\n\nSo, indeed, the first result is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9} and the second is {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}. So they are not equal.\n\nTherefore, the results are not equal, so it's not a general property but just a coincidence for these sets.\n\nI think that's solid.\n</think>\n\n1. (A \u2229 B) \u222a C = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}\n2. A \u2229 (B \u222a C) = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}\n3. No, the results are not equal. This demonstrates that while in some cases the distributive property of union over intersection (or vice versa) might yield the same result, it is not generally true. It's coincidental for these specific sets.\n\nDONE."

Let me write them down first to make sure I understand.\n\nSet A is {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}. Okay, that's straightforward. Set B is {2, 3, 5, 7}. Hmm, got that. And set C is {1, 2, 4, 7, 9}. Alright, so I need to solve three parts: first, (A \u2229 B) \u222a C; second, A \u2229 (B \u222a C); and third, compare the two results to see if they're equal and maybe talk about some set properties.\n\nLet me start with the first part: (A \u2229 B) \u222a C.\n\nAlright, so A \u2229 B means the intersection of A and B. That is, elements that are in both A and B. Let me list out A and B again to find their intersection.\n\nA has 1, 3, 5, 7, 9.\nB has 2, 3, 5, 7.\n\nSo, looking for common elements: 3 is in both, 5 is in both, and 7 is in both. So A \u2229 B is {3, 5, 7}.\n\nNow, I need to take that result and union it with C. So (A \u2229 B) \u222a C becomes {3, 5, 7} \u222a {1, 2, 4, 7, 9}.\n\nUnion means combining all unique elements from both sets. So let's see:\n\nFrom {3, 5, 7}, we have 3,5,7.\nFrom C, we have 1,2,4,7,9.\n\nCombining these, we get 1,2,3,4,5,7,9. So the first result is {1,2,3,4,5,7,9}.\n\nAlright, moving on to the second part: A \u2229 (B \u222a C).\n\nFirst, I need to find B \u222a C. So B is {2,3,5,7}, and C is {1,2,4,7,9}.\n\nUnion of B and C would be all elements from both sets without duplicates. So combining them:\n\nFrom B: 2,3,5,7\nFrom C: 1,2,4,7,9\n\nSo B \u222a C is {1,2,3,4,5,7,9}.\n\nNow, I need to find A \u2229 (B \u222a C). So A is {1,3,5,7,9}, and B \u222a C is {1,2,3,4,5,7,9}.\n\nIntersection means elements that are in both A and B \u222a C. Let's check each element:\n\n1: Yes, in both.\n2: Not in A.\n3: Yes.\n4: Not in A.\n5: Yes.\n7: Yes.\n9: Yes.\n\nSo the intersection is {1,3,5,7,9}.\n\nWait, that's exactly set A. Hmm, that's interesting. So A \u2229 (B \u222a C) is A itself because A is a subset of B \u222a C? Let me double-check.\n\nB \u222a C includes all elements of B and C. A has elements 1,3,5,7,9. B \u222a C also has all those elements because:\n\n- 1 is in C.\n- 3 is in B.\n- 5 is in B.\n- 7 is in both.\n- 9 is in C.\n\nSo yes, every element of A is in B \u222a C. Therefore, A is a subset of B \u222a C, so their intersection is A itself.\n\nSo the second result is {1,3,5,7,9}.\n\nNow, the third part asks if the results from parts 1 and 2 are equal. So first result was {1,2,3,4,5,7,9}, second was {1,3,5,7,9}. Are they equal?\n\nWell, no. The first one has an extra element 2 and 4, while the second one doesn't. So they are not equal.\n\nBut wait, the second result is A, and the first is a larger set. So they are different.\n\nSo, to answer part 3: No, the results are not equal. Now, the question is whether this demonstrates a general property of sets or if it's just a coincidence.\n\nI think it's a general property. Let me recall the distributive law in sets: A \u2229 (B \u222a C) is equal to (A \u2229 B) \u222a (A \u2229 C). Is that right? Wait, actually, the distributive law states that A \u2229 (B \u222a C) = (A \u2229 B) \u222a (A \u2229 C). So it's not necessarily equal to (A \u2229 B) \u222a C unless C is a subset of A or something.\n\nWait, in our case, the first part was (A \u2229 B) \u222a C, and the second was A \u2229 (B \u222a C). These are not necessarily equal in general. So it's not a general property that they are equal; it's just a coincidence for these specific sets.\n\nWait, but in our case, A \u2229 (B \u222a C) was equal to A because A was a subset of B \u222a C. So A \u2229 (B \u222a C) = A. On the other hand, (A \u2229 B) \u222a C was a larger set because it included elements from C not in A. So in this specific case, they are different.\n\nBut in general, A \u2229 (B \u222a C) is equal to (A \u2229 B) \u222a (A \u2229 C). So it's not necessarily equal to (A \u2229 B) \u222a C unless A and C have some specific relationship, which in this case they don't. So it's not a general property; it's just that in this particular case, the second result is A, and the first is a larger set, so they are different.\n\nSo to sum up:\n\n1. (A \u2229 B) \u222a C = {1,2,3,4,5,7,9}\n2. A \u2229 (B \u222a C) = {1,3,5,7,9}\n3. They are not equal, so it's not a general property but just a coincidence here.\n</think>\n\n1.

Let me first write them down to make sure I have them correctly.\n\nSet A is {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}. Okay, that's straightforward. Set B is {2, 3, 5, 7}. Got it. And set C is {1, 2, 4, 7, 9}. Hmm, so each of these sets has some overlapping elements and some unique ones.\n\nThe problem has three parts. Let's tackle them one by one.\n\n**1. (A \u2229 B) \u222a C**\n\nFirst, I need to find the intersection of A and B, which is A \u2229 B. Intersection means elements that are in both A and B. Let me see:\n\n- A has 1, 3, 5, 7, 9.\n- B has 2, 3, 5, 7.\n\nSo, the common elements are 3, 5, and 7. That means A \u2229 B is {3, 5, 7}.\n\nNow, I need to take this result and perform a union with set C. Union means combining all elements from both sets, but without duplicates. So, let's see:\n\n- A \u2229 B is {3, 5, 7}.\n- C is {1, 2, 4, 7, 9}.\n\nCombining these, we get {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}. I think that's all the elements from both sets without repeating any. So, (A \u2229 B) \u222a C is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}.\n\n**2. A \u2229 (B \u222a C)**\n\nNext, I need to find A intersected with the union of B and C. Let's break it down:\n\nFirst, find B \u222a C. That means all elements that are in B or C or both.\n\n- B is {2, 3, 5, 7}.\n- C is {1, 2, 4, 7, 9}.\n\nCombining these, we get {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}. Wait, that's the same as part 1. Interesting.\n\nNow, take this union and intersect it with set A. So, A is {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}. The intersection means elements common to both A and (B \u222a C).\n\nLooking at A's elements and comparing with the union:\n\n- A has 1, 3, 5, 7, 9.\n- The union has 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9.\n\nSo, the common elements are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9. Therefore, A \u2229 (B \u222a C) is {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}.\n\n**3. Are the results from parts 1 and 2 equal?**\n\nLooking back:\n\n- Part 1: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}\n- Part 2: {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}\n\nSo, they are not equal because part 1 has the element 2 and 4, which part 2 doesn't. However, both have 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 in common.\n\nNow, the second part of question 3 asks if this demonstrates a general property of sets or if it's just a coincidence. Hmm, I remember something about distributive laws in sets. Specifically, the distributive law states that for any sets A, B, C, (A \u2229 B) \u222a C is equal to A \u2229 (B \u222a C). Wait, but in our case, they aren't equal. So, does that mean I'm misapplying the law?\n\nWait, let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating.\n\nIn part 1, (A \u2229 B) is {3,5,7}. Then union with C, which is {1,2,4,7,9}. So, union is {1,2,3,4,5,7,9}.\n\nIn part 2, B \u222a C is {1,2,3,4,5,7,9}. Then intersect with A, which is {1,3,5,7,9}.\n\nWait, but according to the distributive law, they should be equal. So, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nLet me re-examine.\n\nDistributive law: (A \u2229 B) \u222a C = A \u2229 (B \u222a C). Is that always true? Or is it (A \u2229 (B \u222a C)) = (A \u2229 B) \u222a (A \u2229 C))?\n\nWait, maybe I confused the order. Let me recall the exact distributive law.\n\nIn set theory, the distributive law for union states:\n\nA \u2229 (B \u222a C) = (A \u2229 B) \u222a (A \u2229 C)\n\nSimilarly, A \u222a (B \u2229 C) = (A \u222a B) \u2229 (A \u222a C)\n\nSo, perhaps I was thinking of the wrong distributive law earlier.\n\nIn our problem:\n\nPart 1: (A \u2229 B) \u222a C\n\nPart 2: A \u2229 (B \u222a C)\n\nAccording to the distributive law, A \u2229 (B \u222a C) is equal to (A \u2229 B) \u222a (A \u2229 C). So, that would mean part 2 is (A \u2229 B) \u222a (A \u2229 C). But in our case, part 1 is (A \u2229 B) \u222a C, which is different.\n\nWait, so perhaps the two expressions aren't necessarily equal. So, in this case, part 1 is (A \u2229 B) \u222a C, and part 2 is (A \u2229 B) \u222a (A \u2229 C). So, unless C is a subset of A, these could be different.\n\nWait, but in our case:\n\n(A \u2229 B) \u222a C = {3,5,7} \u222a {1,2,4,7,9} = {1,2,3,4,5,7,9}\n\nA \u2229 (B \u222a C) = A \u2229 {1,2,3,4,5,7,9} = {1,3,5,7,9}\n\nSo, they are not equal because (A \u2229 B) \u222a C includes 2 and 4 from C, which are not in A. So, in this case, the two expressions are not equal.\n\nTherefore, it's not a general property that (A \u2229 B) \u222a C equals A \u2229 (B \u222a C). That equality only holds if certain conditions are met, such as C being a subset of A, or perhaps other constraints.\n\nWait, let me think again. If C is a subset of A, then (A \u2229 B) \u222a C would equal A \u2229 (B \u222a C). Because if C is in A, then unioning with (A \u2229 B) would just be A \u2229 B union C, which is A \u2229 (B \u222a C). So, in that case, they would be equal.\n\nBut in our problem, C is not a subset of A because C has elements like 2 and 4, which are not in A. Therefore, (A \u2229 B) \u222a C includes elements from C that are not in A, making it different from A \u2229 (B \u222a C), which only includes elements common to A and the union of B and C.\n\nSo, in this particular case, it's just a coincidence that the results are different, but it doesn't demonstrate a general property. It shows that the distributive law doesn't always hold in set theory, or perhaps I was misapplying it earlier.\n\nWait, no, the distributive law does hold in set theory, but it's specific to how unions and intersections interact. Let me clarify:\n\nThe correct distributive law is:\n\nA \u2229 (B \u222a C) = (A \u2229 B) \u222a (A \u2229 C)\n\nSo, part 2 is (A \u2229 B) \u222a (A \u2229 C). Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, A \u2229 B is {3,5,7}.\n\nA \u2229 C is {1,7,9} because A is {1,3,5,7,9} and C is {1,2,4,7,9}.\n\nSo, (A \u2229 B) \u222a (A \u2229 C) is {3,5,7} \u222a {1,7,9} = {1,3,5,7,9}.\n\nWhich is exactly what part 2 is. So, part 2 is equal to (A \u2229 B) \u222a (A \u2229 C), which is the distributive law.\n\nBut part 1 is (A \u2229 B) \u222a C, which is different because C includes elements not in A, leading to extra elements in the union.\n\nTherefore, the two results are not equal, and this isn't a general property but rather a specific case because C isn't a subset of A.\n</think>\n\n1. (A \u2229 B) \u222a C = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}\n2. A \u2229 (B \u222a C) = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}\n3. No, the results are not equal. The equality does not hold in this case, demonstrating that it is not a general property of sets but rather a coincidence due to the specific elements in set C.\n\nDONE."

    "solution": "Solve this problem step by step. End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: Consider three sets A, B, and C defined as follows:\nA = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}\nB = {2, 3, 5, 7}\nC = {1, 2, 4, 7, 9}\n\nDetermine the following:\n1. (A \u2229 B) \u222a C\n2. A \u2229 (B \u222a C)\n3. Are the results from parts 1 and 2 equal? If so, does this demonstrate a general property of sets, or is it just a coincidence for these particular sets? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this problem here with three sets A, B, and C. Let me write them down first to make sure I have everything clear.\n\nSet A is {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}. Okay, so that's all the odd numbers from 1 to 9. Set B is {2, 3, 5, 7}. Hmm, that's the even numbers from 2 to 8, but only 2, 3, 5, 7. Wait, no, 3 and 5 and 7 are odd. So actually, B includes both even and odd numbers. Interesting. And set C is {1, 2, 4, 7, 9}. So that has a mix of even and odd numbers too.\n\nNow, I need to solve three parts. Let's start with the first one: (A \u2229 B) \u222a C.\n\nOkay, so first, I need to find the intersection of A and B, which is A \u2229 B. Intersection means elements that are in both A and B. Let me list out the elements of A and B again.\n\nA: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9  \nB: 2, 3, 5, 7\n\nSo, looking for common elements. 3 is in both, 5 is in both, 7 is in both. What about 1? No, 1 is only in A. 2 is only in B. So A \u2229 B is {3, 5, 7}.\n\nNow, I need to take this result and perform a union with C. So (A \u2229 B) \u222a C = {3, 5, 7} \u222a {1, 2, 4, 7, 9}.\n\nUnion means combining all unique elements from both sets. So let's see:\n\nFrom {3, 5, 7}, we have 3, 5, 7.  \nFrom C, we have 1, 2, 4, 7, 9.  \nSo combining these, we get 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9.  \nWait, is that all? Let me double-check. 1 is only in C, 2 is only in C, 3 is only in A \u2229 B, 4 is only in C, 5 is only in A \u2229 B, 7 is in both, and 9 is only in C. So yes, the union is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}.\n\nAlright, that's part 1 done.\n\nMoving on to part 2: A \u2229 (B \u222a C). Okay, so first, I need to find B \u222a C, and then intersect that with A.\n\nLet's start with B \u222a C. Set B is {2, 3, 5, 7}, and set C is {1, 2, 4, 7, 9}. So union means combining these. Let's list out all the elements:\n\nFrom B: 2, 3, 5, 7  \nFrom C: 1, 2, 4, 7, 9  \nSo combining these, we get 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9. Wait, that's the same as the previous result. Interesting, so B \u222a C is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}.\n\nNow, we need to intersect this with A. So A is {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}, and B \u222a C is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}. Intersection means elements common to both.\n\nLooking at both sets:\n\nA: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9  \nB \u222a C: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9\n\nCommon elements are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9. So A \u2229 (B \u222a C) is {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}, which is the same as set A.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So for part 1, we had {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}, and for part 2, we have {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}. So they are not equal because part 1 has elements 2 and 4 that part 2 doesn't have, and part 2 has all the elements of A, whereas part 1 has more elements.\n\nSo, moving on to part 3: Are the results from parts 1 and 2 equal? From what I just found, no, they are not equal. Part 1 is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}, and part 2 is {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}. So they differ by elements 2 and 4.\n\nNow, the second part of question 3 asks whether this demonstrates a general property of sets or just a coincidence. Let me think.\n\nIn general, for any sets A, B, and C, is (A \u2229 B) \u222a C always equal to A \u2229 (B \u222a C)? Let me recall some set theory.\n\nI remember that in general, distributive laws apply, but they don't always hold unless certain conditions are met. Specifically, the distributive law (A \u2229 B) \u222a C = A \u2229 (B \u222a C) holds if the sets are \"distributive\" over each other, which often isn't the case. \n\nWait, but in this specific case, it's not holding because the results are different. So it's not a general property. Therefore, the fact that they are unequal here is not a coincidence but shows that the distributive law doesn't hold in general. However, in some specific cases, it might hold.\n\nWait, no, in this case, the distributive law didn't hold because the intersection was not distributing over the union. So, the equality doesn't hold in general, but it might hold under certain conditions, like if C is a subset of A or something like that.\n\nWait, let me test that. Suppose C is a subset of A. Let's say C = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}, same as A. Then (A \u2229 B) \u222a C would be {3, 5, 7} \u222a {1, 3, 5, 7, 9} = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}, same as A. And A \u2229 (B \u222a C) would be A \u2229 (B \u222a A) = A \u2229 A = A. So in that case, they are equal.\n\nSimilarly, if C is a subset of B, let's say C = {2, 3, 5, 7}, same as B. Then (A \u2229 B) \u222a C = {3, 5, 7} \u222a {2, 3, 5, 7} = {2, 3, 5, 7}. And A \u2229 (B \u222a C) = A \u2229 (B \u222a B) = A \u2229 B = {3, 5, 7}. So in this case, they are not equal either. Wait, so even if C is a subset of B, they are not equal. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe if C is a subset of both A and B? Let's say C = {3, 5, 7}. Then (A \u2229 B) \u222a C = {3, 5, 7} \u222a {3, 5, 7} = {3, 5, 7}. And A \u2229 (B \u222a C) = A \u2229 (B \u222a {3,5,7}) = A \u2229 {2,3,5,7} = {3,5,7}. So in that case, they are equal.\n\nSo it seems that if C is a subset of both A and B, then (A \u2229 B) \u222a C equals A \u2229 (B \u222a C). But if C has elements not in A or B, then it might not hold.\n\nIn our original problem, C has elements like 1, 2, 4, 9 which are not in A or B. So in this case, the distributive law doesn't hold.\n\nSo, to answer part 3: No, the results are not equal, and this is not a general property of sets. It only holds in specific cases where certain conditions are met, such as C being a subset of both A and B. Otherwise, the distributive law doesn't hold, and the two expressions can yield different results.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\n1. (A \u2229 B) \u222a C = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}\n2. A \u2229 (B \u222a C) = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}\n3. They are not equal, and this demonstrates that the distributive law (A \u2229 B) \u222a C = A \u2229 (B \u222a C) does not hold in general. It only holds under specific conditions, such as when C is a subset of both A and B.\n</think>\n\n1. (A \u2229 B) \u222a C = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}\n2. A \u2229 (B \u222a C) = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}\n3. No, the results are not equal. This demonstrates that the distributive law does not hold in general for sets A, B, and C as given. It only holds under specific conditions, such as when C is a subset of both A and B.\n\nDONE."

Compare the results of parts 1 and 2 and discuss if they are equal, and if so, whether that's a general property or just a coincidence.\n\nOkay, let's start with part 1: (A \u2229 B) \u222a C.\n\nFirst, I need to find the intersection of A and B, which is A \u2229 B. The intersection of two sets contains all elements that are common to both sets.\n\nLooking at A: {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}\nLooking at B: {2, 3, 5, 7}\n\nSo, the common elements between A and B are 3, 5, and 7. Therefore, A \u2229 B = {3, 5, 7}.\n\nNext, I need to take this result and perform a union with set C. The union of two sets includes all elements that are in either of the sets.\n\nSet C is {1, 2, 4, 7, 9}.\n\nSo, (A \u2229 B) \u222a C is the union of {3, 5, 7} and {1, 2, 4, 7, 9}.\n\nLet's list out all the elements:\n\nFrom {3, 5, 7}: 3, 5, 7\nFrom {1, 2, 4, 7, 9}: 1, 2, 4, 7, 9\n\nCombining these, we have: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9.\n\nSo, (A \u2229 B) \u222a C = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}\n\nNow, moving on to part 2: A \u2229 (B \u222a C).\n\nAgain, I need to find the intersection of A with the union of B and C.\n\nFirst, find B \u222a C. The union of B and C includes all elements that are in either B or C.\n\nB is {2, 3, 5, 7}\nC is {1, 2, 4, 7, 9}\n\nSo, B \u222a C is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}.\n\nNow, we need to find A \u2229 (B \u222a C). That is, the intersection of A with {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}.\n\nSet A is {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}, and the other set is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}.\n\nSo, the intersection will be all elements that are in both A and B \u222a C.\n\nLooking at A: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9\nLooking at B \u222a C: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9\n\nThe common elements are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9. So, A \u2229 (B \u222a C) = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}\n\nWait a minute, that's interesting. So, for part 1, (A \u2229 B) \u222a C is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}, and for part 2, A \u2229 (B \u222a C) is {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}.\n\nSo, they are not equal. The first one has 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, and the second has 1, 3, 5, 7, 9.\n\nHmm. So, the results are different. So, the answer to part 3 is that they are not equal, but maybe there's a general property.\n\nWait, no, in this case, they are not equal. So, the results from parts 1 and 2 are not equal. Therefore, the answer to part 3 is that they are not equal, and it's not a general property, but rather a coincidence for these specific sets.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my work because it's surprising that they are different.\n\nLet me recheck part 1: (A \u2229 B) \u222a C.\n\nA \u2229 B is {3,5,7}, correct.\n\nUnion with C: {1,2,4,7,9}.\n\nSo, combining these, we have 1,2,3,4,5,7,9.

Correct.\n\nSo, yes, they are different.\n\nTherefore, the results are not equal, and this is just a coincidence for these specific sets. It doesn't hold in general because, in general, (A \u2229 B) \u222a C and A \u2229 (B \u222a C) can be different.\n\nWait, but sometimes they might be equal. So, it's not a general property, but it's possible for certain sets.\n\nIn this case, it's just a coincidence.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n1. (A \u2229 B) \u222a C = {1,2,3,4,5,7,9}\n2. A \u2229 (B \u222a C) = {1,3,5,7,9}\n3. They are not equal, and it's not a general property.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a general property where sometimes (A \u2229 B) \u222a C equals A \u2229 (B \u222a C)?\n\nWell, if C is a subset of A, then maybe.\n\nWait, in this case, C is {1,2,4,7,9}, and A is {1,3,5,7,9}. So, C is not a subset of A because it has 2 and 4 which are not in A. Similarly, A is not a subset of C either.\n\nBut if C were a subset of A, then (A \u2229 B) \u222a C would be A \u2229 B \u222a C, which is the same as A \u2229 (B \u222a C) only if C is a subset of A and other conditions.\n\nWait, no, let's think about it.\n\nSuppose C is a subset of A. Then, (A \u2229 B) \u222a C would be A \u2229 B \u222a C, which is equal to A \u2229 (B \u222a C) only if C is a subset of A and other conditions. Actually, no, in general, (A \u2229 B) \u222a C is equal to A \u2229 (B \u222a C) only if (A \u2229 B) \u222a C is the same as A \u2229 (B \u222a C). Let me see.\n\nWait, in general, (A \u2229 B) \u222a C is equal to A \u2229 (B \u222a C) if and only if (A \u2229 B) \u222a C = A \u2229 (B \u222a C). So, when does that happen?\n\nLet me write it out:\n\n(A \u2229 B) \u222a C = A \u2229 (B \u222a C)\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\n(A \u2229 B) \u222a C = A \u2229 (B \u222a C)\n\nThis is equivalent to (A \u2229 B) \u222a C = (A \u2229 B) \u222a (A \u2229 C)\n\nWait, because A \u2229 (B \u222a C) = (A \u2229 B) \u222a (A \u2229 C).\n\nSo, (A \u2229 B) \u222a C = (A \u2229 B) \u222a (A \u2229 C)\n\nWhich implies that C must be a subset of (A \u2229 C), but that's always true because C is a subset of itself.\n\nWait, no, more precisely, for the union to be equal, the sets being united must be the same. So, (A \u2229 B) \u222a C = (A \u2229 B) \u222a (A \u2229 C)\n\nWhich implies that C must be equal to (A \u2229 C). So, C must be a subset of A.\n\nWait, no, more precisely, C must be equal to A \u2229 C, which means that C is a subset of A.\n\nSo, if C is a subset of A, then (A \u2229 B) \u222a C = (A \u2229 B) \u222a (A \u2229 C) = A \u2229 (B \u222a C)\n\nTherefore, if C is a subset of A, then (A \u2229 B) \u222a C = A \u2229 (B \u222a C)\n\nIn our case, C is {1,2,4,7,9}, and A is {1,3,5,7,9}. So, C is not a subset of A because it contains 2 and 4 which are not in A. Therefore, C is not a subset of A, so the equality does not hold, which is why (A \u2229 B) \u222a C \u2260 A \u2229 (B \u222a C) in this case.\n\nSo, in general, if C is a subset of A, then these two expressions are equal. Otherwise, they are not. Therefore, in this problem, since C is not a subset of A, the results are different.\n\nSo, that explains why they are not equal here, and it's not a general property, but rather a specific case where the equality holds only if C is a subset of A.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n1. (A \u2229 B) \u222a C = {1,2,3,4,5,7,9}\n2. A \u2229 (B \u222a C) = {1,3,5,7,9}\n3. They are not equal, and this happens because C is not a subset of A. If C were a subset of A, then these two expressions would be equal, which would be a general property.\n</think>\n\n1. (A \u2229 B) \u222a C = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}\n2. A \u2229 (B \u222a C) = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}\n3. The results are not equal, and this is not a general property but a coincidence for these sets.\n\nDONE."

    "solution": "Solve this problem step by step. End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: Consider three sets A, B, and C defined as follows:\nA = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}\nB = {2, 3, 5, 7}\nC = {1, 2, 4, 7, 9}\n\nDetermine the following:\n1. (A \u2229 B) \u222a C\n2. A \u2229 (B \u222a C)\n3. Are the results from parts 1 and 2 equal? If so, does this demonstrate a general property of sets, or is it just a coincidence for these particular sets? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this problem with three sets A, B, and C. I need to figure out the results for two different set operations and then compare them to see if they're equal. Let's take it step by step.\n\nFirst, let me write down what each set contains:\n\n- A = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}\n- B = {2, 3, 5, 7}\n- C = {1, 2, 4, 7, 9}\n\nOkay, so the first part is (A \u2229 B) \u222a C. I think I should solve this in two steps. First, find the intersection of A and B, which is A \u2229 B. Then, take that result and perform a union with C.\n\nStarting with A \u2229 B. The intersection of two sets contains all elements that are in both sets. So, let's look at A and B:\n\nA has elements 1, 3, 5, 7, 9.\nB has elements 2, 3, 5, 7.\n\nLooking for common elements, I see 3, 5, and 7 are in both. So, A \u2229 B = {3, 5, 7}.\n\nNow, I need to take this result and union it with set C. So, (A \u2229 B) \u222a C is {3, 5, 7} \u222a {1, 2, 4, 7, 9}.\n\nWhen we take the union of two sets, we combine all the elements from both sets without duplication. So, combining {3, 5, 7} and {1, 2, 4, 7, 9}, the combined set is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}. I can write that as {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}.\n\nAlright, that's part 1 done. Now, moving on to part 2: A \u2229 (B \u222a C). This seems a bit trickier because the parentheses matter here. I need to compute B \u222a C first and then intersect that with A.\n\nStarting with B \u222a C. The union of B and C will include all elements from both sets. Let's see:\n\nB = {2, 3, 5, 7}\nC = {1, 2, 4, 7, 9}\n\nCombining these, the union would be {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}. Wait, that's the same as what we got in part 1. Interesting.\n\nNow, we need to intersect this result with A. So, A \u2229 (B \u222a C) is A \u2229 {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}.\n\nLooking at set A, which is {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}, and the union we just did, {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}, the intersection would be the elements common to both. So, that's 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9. Therefore, A \u2229 (B \u222a C) = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}.\n\nWait a minute, that's the same as set A itself. That's because the union of B and C includes all elements of A except for 4, which isn't in A, but since we're intersecting with A, any elements not in A will be excluded. So, yeah, it's just A.\n\nNow, comparing the results from part 1 and part 2:\n\n- Part 1: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}\n- Part 2: {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}\n\nThey are not equal. Part 1 has more elements, specifically 2 and 4, which aren't in part 2.\n\nSo, the answer to the third question is that they are not equal. But why is that? Is there a general property here or is it just a coincidence?\n\nThinking about set theory, I recall that in general, (A \u2229 B) \u222a C is not necessarily equal to A \u2229 (B \u222a C). These are known as the distributive laws of union over intersection, and they don't always hold unless certain conditions are met.\n\nIn this case, since C has elements not present in A, the order in which we apply the operations affects the result. If we first take the intersection of A and B, then union with C, we include those extra elements from C, whereas if we first take the union of B and C, then intersect with A, those extra elements are excluded because A doesn't have them.\n\nSo, it's not just a coincidence; it's illustrating that the distributive law doesn't hold in general for union over intersection. The results can differ depending on the sets involved.\n\nPutting it all together, the answers are:\n\n1. {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}\n2. {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}\n3. They are not equal, and this demonstrates that the distributive law doesn't hold universally, but depends on the specific sets.\n</think>\n\n1. (A \u2229 B) \u222a C = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}\n2. A \u2229 (B \u222a C) = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}\n3. They are not equal, showing the distributive law does not always hold.\n\nThe results are not equal because the order of operations affects the outcome. The distributive law doesn't universally apply, hence it's not a general property but rather a coincidence based on the specific sets.\n\nDONE."
