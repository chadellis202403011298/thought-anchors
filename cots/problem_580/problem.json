  "question": "Consider three sets A, B, and C defined as follows:\nA = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}\nB = {2, 3, 5, 7}\nC = {1, 2, 4, 7, 9}\n\nDetermine the following:\n1. (A \u2229 B) \u222a C\n2. A \u2229 (B \u222a C)\n3. Are the results from parts 1 and 2 equal? If so, does this demonstrate a general property of sets, or is it just a coincidence for these particular sets?",
  "answer": "Let's solve this step by step:\n\n1. To find (A \u2229 B) \u222a C:\n   - First, we need to find A \u2229 B\n   - A = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}\n   - B = {2, 3, 5, 7}\n   - A \u2229 B = {3, 5, 7} (the elements that appear in both A and B)\n   - Now, we find (A \u2229 B) \u222a C\n   - C = {1, 2, 4, 7, 9}\n   - (A \u2229 B) \u222a C = {3, 5, 7} \u222a {1, 2, 4, 7, 9} = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}\n\n2. To find A \u2229 (B \u222a C):\n   - First, we need to find B \u222a C\n   - B = {2, 3, 5, 7}\n   - C = {1, 2, 4, 7, 9}\n   - B \u222a C = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9} (all elements that appear in either B or C)\n   - Now, we find A \u2229 (B \u222a C)\n   - A = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}\n   - A \u2229 (B \u222a C) = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9} \u2229 {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9} = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}\n\n3. The results from parts 1 and 2 are not equal:\n   - (A \u2229 B) \u222a C = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9}\n   - A \u2229 (B \u222a C) = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}\n   - This shows that the distributive property (A \u2229 B) \u222a C = A \u2229 (B \u222a C) does not hold in general for set operations.\n   - The correct distributive properties in set theory are:\n     * A \u2229 (B \u222a C) = (A \u2229 B) \u222a (A \u2229 C)\n     * A \u222a (B \u2229 C) = (A \u222a B) \u2229 (A \u222a C)\n   - The results being different is not a coincidence but demonstrates that we cannot arbitrarily distribute set operations."
