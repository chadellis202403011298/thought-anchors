  "question": "A hospital conducted a survey about patient preferences for morning (M) or afternoon (A) appointments. Out of 200 patients, 120 preferred morning appointments and 80 preferred afternoon appointments. Additionally, 100 patients were female (F) and 100 were male (M). Among the female patients, 70 preferred morning appointments. Based on this information, determine whether gender and appointment time preference are independent events. Explain your reasoning carefully.",
  "answer": "To determine whether gender and appointment time preference are independent events, I need to check if P(M|F) = P(M) or equivalently if P(F\u2229M) = P(F)\u00d7P(M).\n\nGiven information:\n- Total patients: 200\n- Morning preference (M): 120 patients\n- Afternoon preference (A): 80 patients\n- Female patients (F): 100 patients\n- Male patients: 100 patients\n- Female patients with morning preference (F\u2229M): 70 patients\n\nStep 1: Calculate the probability of morning preference P(M).\nP(M) = 120/200 = 0.6\n\nStep 2: Calculate the probability of being female P(F).\nP(F) = 100/200 = 0.5\n\nStep 3: Calculate the probability of being female AND having morning preference P(F\u2229M).\nP(F\u2229M) = 70/200 = 0.35\n\nStep 4: Calculate the product P(F)\u00d7P(M).\nP(F)\u00d7P(M) = 0.5 \u00d7 0.6 = 0.3\n\nStep 5: Compare P(F\u2229M) with P(F)\u00d7P(M).\nP(F\u2229M) = 0.35 and P(F)\u00d7P(M) = 0.3\n\nSince P(F\u2229M) \u2260 P(F)\u00d7P(M), the events are not independent.\n\nAlternatively, we can check if P(M|F) = P(M):\nP(M|F) = P(F\u2229M)/P(F) = 70/100 = 0.7\nP(M) = 120/200 = 0.6\n\nSince P(M|F) \u2260 P(M), we confirm that gender and appointment time preference are dependent events. This means that a patient's gender influences their preference for appointment times."
