  "question": "A man lives on the 10th floor of an apartment building. Every morning he takes the elevator down to the ground floor to go to work. In the evening, when he returns from work, he takes the elevator to the 7th floor and then walks up the stairs for the remaining three floors to his apartment. However, on rainy days or when there are other people in the elevator, he goes directly to the 10th floor. Why does he do this?",
  "answer": "The man is of short stature and cannot reach the button for the 10th floor in the elevator. He can only reach the buttons up to the 7th floor. When it rains, he has an umbrella with him, which he can use to press the 10th floor button. Similarly, when other people are in the elevator, they can press the 10th floor button for him, or he can ask them to do so.\n\nThis problem requires relaxing assumptions about why the man behaves differently in different situations. Most people initially assume complex reasons related to exercise, rituals, or superstitions. The solution becomes clear when we relax the constraint that the man can physically reach all buttons in the elevator. This is a classic example of constraint relaxation in lateral thinking, where the solution emerges by questioning an implicit assumption."
