  "question": "Three friends, Alex, Blake, and Casey, are suspected of cheating on an exam. During investigation, they made the following statements:\n\nAlex: 'I didn't cheat, and Casey didn't cheat either.'\nBlake: 'If Alex cheated, then Casey cheated too.'\nCasey: 'I didn't cheat, but either Alex or Blake did.'\n\nIf exactly one of them is telling the truth, who cheated on the exam?",
  "answer": "Let's use propositional logic to solve this problem. First, let's define our variables:\n- A: Alex cheated\n- B: Blake cheated\n- C: Casey cheated\n\nNow, let's translate each statement into logical form:\n\nAlex's statement: \u00acA \u2227 \u00acC (\"I didn't cheat and Casey didn't cheat\")\nBlake's statement: A \u2192 C (\"If Alex cheated, then Casey cheated too\")\nCasey's statement: \u00acC \u2227 (A \u2228 B) (\"I didn't cheat, but either Alex or Blake did\")\n\nSince exactly one of them is telling the truth, we need to check each possibility.\n\nCase 1: Alex is telling the truth, Blake and Casey are lying.\n- From Alex: \u00acA and \u00acC are true (Alex and Casey didn't cheat)\n- Blake's statement A \u2192 C is false, which means A is true and C is false. This contradicts \u00acA being true.\n\nCase 2: Blake is telling the truth, Alex and Casey are lying.\n- From Blake: A \u2192 C is true\n- From Alex being false: It's not the case that (\u00acA \u2227 \u00acC), so either A is true or C is true (or both)\n- From Casey being false: Either C is true or neither Alex nor Blake cheated\n\nThe most consistent scenario is: A is true (Alex cheated), B is true (Blake cheated), and C is true (Casey cheated). But this means everyone cheated, which seems inconsistent with someone telling the truth about the situation.\n\nCase 3: Casey is telling the truth, Alex and Blake are lying.\n- From Casey: \u00acC is true (Casey didn't cheat) and (A \u2228 B) is true (Alex or Blake or both cheated)\n- From Alex being false: It's not the case that (\u00acA \u2227 \u00acC), so either A is true or C is true\n- Since we established C is false from Casey's statement, A must be true (Alex cheated)\n- From Blake's statement being false: A is true and C is false, which we've already established\n\nThis gives us a consistent scenario: A is true (Alex cheated), B is true (Blake cheated), and C is false (Casey didn't cheat).\n\nTherefore, Alex and Blake cheated on the exam, while Casey did not."
