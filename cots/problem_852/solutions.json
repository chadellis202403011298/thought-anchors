    "solution": "Solve this problem step by step. End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: Three friends, Alex, Blake, and Casey, are suspected of cheating on an exam. During investigation, they made the following statements:\n\nAlex: 'I didn't cheat, and Casey didn't cheat either.'\nBlake: 'If Alex cheated, then Casey cheated too.'\nCasey: 'I didn't cheat, but either Alex or Blake did.'\n\nIf exactly one of them is telling the truth, who cheated on the exam? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I've got this logic puzzle here about three friends: Alex, Blake, and Casey. They're all suspected of cheating on an exam. Each of them made a statement, and the challenge is to figure out who cheated, given that exactly one of them is telling the truth.\n\nFirst, let me write down what each person said to keep things clear.\n\nAlex: \"I didn't cheat, and Casey didn't cheat either.\"\n\nBlake: \"If Alex cheated, then Casey cheated too.\"\n\nCasey: \"I didn't cheat, but either Alex or Blake did.\"\n\nOkay, so we have three statements. We know that exactly one of them is telling the truth, and we need to determine who cheated based on that.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. Since only one person is telling the truth, that means the other two are lying. So, I can assume each scenario where one person is truthful and see if it holds up.\n\nLet's start by considering each person as the one telling the truth, one by one.\n\n**Scenario 1: Alex is telling the truth.**\n\nIf Alex is truthful, then both parts of his statement are true:\n1. Alex didn't cheat.\n2. Casey didn't cheat either.\n\nSo, if Alex is truthful, then Casey also didn't cheat.\n\nNow, let's see what Blake and Casey said in this scenario.\n\nBlake said: \"If Alex cheated, then Casey cheated too.\"\n\nBut if Alex didn't cheat, the conditional statement \"If Alex cheated, then Casey cheated\" is automatically true, regardless of Casey's actions. However, since Alex didn't cheat, the statement doesn't really tell us anything definitive about Casey. But since we're assuming only one person is telling the truth, Blake must be lying here. Therefore, Blake's statement is false.\n\nCasey said: \"I didn't cheat, but either Alex or Blake did.\"\n\nSince we've assumed Alex didn't cheat, and if Casey is lying, then the opposite of his statement must be true. The opposite of Casey's statement would be: \"I cheated, and neither Alex nor Blake did.\" But wait, that doesn't make sense because if Casey is lying, then at least one part of his statement is false. Let's break it down.\n\nCasey's statement has two parts:\n1. I didn't cheat.\n2. Either Alex or Blake did.\n\nIf Casey is lying, then at least one of these is false.\n\nIf Casey didn't cheat (part 1 is true), then part 2 must be false for Casey to be lying. So, part 2 is \"Either Alex or Blake did,\" which would mean if that's false, then neither Alex nor Blake did. But if neither Alex nor Blake did, and Casey didn't cheat, then who did? There's no one left. But we know that exactly one person is lying, so maybe this scenario is possible.\n\nWait, but if Alex is telling the truth, then Casey didn't cheat, and neither did Alex. So, that leaves Blake. If Blake is lying, then his statement is false. But Blake's statement is a conditional: \"If Alex cheated, then Casey cheats.\" Since Alex didn't cheat, the statement is true. So, if Blake's statement is true, but we assumed only one person is telling the truth, this leads to a contradiction because both Alex and Blake would be telling the truth, which violates the condition.\n\nTherefore, Scenario 1 leads to a contradiction. So, Alex cannot be the one telling the truth.\n\n**Scenario 2: Blake is telling the truth.**\n\nIf Blake is truthful, then his statement \"If Alex cheats, then Casey cheats too\" is true.\n\nGiven that exactly one person is telling the truth, both Alex and Casey must be lying.\n\nLet's see what Alex said: \"I didn't cheat, and Casey didn't cheat either.\"\n\nIf Alex is lying, then at least one part of his statement is false. So, either Alex cheated, or Casey cheated, or both.\n\nBut we also have Blake's statement: If Alex cheats, then Casey cheats.\n\nSince Blake is telling the truth, and we're assuming only he is truthful, then his statement must be true, and the rest must be false.\n\nSo, let's assume Blake is truthful, and Alex is lying.\n\nIf Alex is lying, then either he cheated, Casey cheated, or both.\n\nBut Casey is also lying, so let's see what Casey said.\n\nCasey: \"I didn't cheat, but either Alex or Blake did.\"\n\nSince Casey is lying, at least one part is false.\n\nIf Casey is lying, either he cheated, or the second part is false, meaning that neither Alex nor Blake did.\n\nBut let's break it down.\n\nCasey's statement:\n1. I didn't cheat.\n2. Either Alex or Blake did.\n\nIf Casey is lying, then either:\n- He cheated (making part 1 false), or\n- The second part is false, meaning neither Alex nor Blake did.\n\nBut if the second part is false, then neither Alex nor Blake did. However, we already have that Alex is lying, so Alex might have cheated, but if neither Alex nor Blake did, that contradicts the possibility that Alex cheated.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit tangled. Let's try to map it out.\n\nIf Blake is telling the truth, then:\n\n- If Alex cheats, Casey cheats.\n- Since only Blake is telling the truth, Alex and Casey are lying.\n\nSo, Alex is lying, meaning he either cheated or Casey cheated (or both).\n\nCasey is lying, so he either cheated or the second part is false.\n\nIf Casey is lying, and the second part is false, then neither Alex nor Blake did. But if neither Alex nor Blake did, then Casey must have cheated to satisfy the scenario where someone did cheat.\n\nBut wait, if Casey is lying and the second part is false, then neither Alex nor Blake did, implying Casey cheated. However, if Casey cheated, then according to Blake's statement, if Alex cheated, Casey does too. But we don't know if Alex cheated or not.\n\nWait, but if Blake is truthful, and Alex is lying, then Alex might have cheated. If Alex cheated, then according to Blake, Casey must have cheated too. But Casey is lying, so he either cheated or the second part is false. If Casey cheated, that aligns with Blake's statement, but then Casey is lying because he said he didn't cheat. So, that works.\n\nBut wait, if Alex cheated, and Casey cheated, then both Alex and Casey cheated, but only Blake is telling the truth. However, the problem states that exactly one person is telling the truth, so this scenario seems possible.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIf Blake is truthful:\n- Alex is lying, so Alex either cheated or Casey cheated (or both).\n- Casey is lying, so he either cheated or the second part is false (neither Alex nor Blake did).\n\nIf Casey cheated:\n- Casey is lying because he said he didn't cheat.\n- The second part of Casey's statement is \"either Alex or Blake did,\" which would be true if Casey cheated, but since Casey is lying, the second part must be false. Therefore, neither Alex nor Blake did.\n\nBut if neither Alex nor Blake did, and Casey cheated, that's possible. However, if Alex is lying, and Alex didn't cheat, then Casey must have cheated. But if Casey cheated, then according to Blake's statement, if Alex cheated, Casey does too. But if Alex didn't cheat, Blake's statement doesn't impose anything on Casey.\n\nWait, this is confusing. Let me try to outline the possibilities.\n\nBlake is truthful:\n- Blake: If Alex cheats, then Casey cheats.\n- Alex is lying:\n  - Either Alex cheated or Casey cheated.\n- Casey is lying:\n  - Either Casey cheated or the second part is false (neither Alex nor Blake did).\n\nIf Alex didn't cheat, then Casey must have cheated for Alex to be lying. So, if Alex didn't cheat, Casey cheated. Then, Casey is lying because he said he didn't cheat. The second part of Casey's statement is \"either Alex or Blake did,\" which would be true because Casey cheated, but since Casey is lying, the second part must be false. Therefore, neither Alex nor Blake did. But if Casey cheated and neither Alex nor Blake did, that's possible.\n\nHowever, if Alex didn't cheat, and Casey cheated, then Blake's statement is: If Alex cheats, then Casey cheats. Since Alex didn't cheat, Blake's statement is true regardless. So, in this scenario, Blake is truthful, and Alex and Casey are lying.\n\nBut wait, in this case, only Blake is telling the truth, which fits the condition. So, this scenario is possible.\n\nBut let's check if there's another angle.\n\nAlternatively, if Alex cheated, then according to Blake, Casey must have cheated too. If both Alex and Casey cheated, then Alex is lying because he said he didn't cheat. Casey is lying because he said he didn't cheat. Blake is truthful because if Alex cheated, Casey does too. So, this also fits.\n\nBut the problem states that exactly one of them is telling the truth. So, in this case, Blake is the only one telling the truth, and Alex and Casey are both lying. Whether Alex and Casey both cheated or only one of them did, but given Blake's statement, if Alex cheated, Casey must have cheated too.\n\nWait, but if only one person is telling the truth, and Blake is truthful, then Alex and Casey are lying. If Alex is lying, he either cheated or Casey did. If Casey is lying, he either cheated or neither did. But if neither did, then who cheated? Since only one person is lying, and exactly one is truthful, this might not fit.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused again. Let's try to structure this.\n\nIf Blake is truthful:\n- Alex is lying: So, either Alex cheated or Casey did.\n- Casey is lying: So, either Casey cheated or neither Alex nor Blake did.\n\nIf Alex is lying, and Casey is lying, and only Blake is truthful.\n\nCase 1: Alex cheated.\n- Then, according to Blake, Casey must have cheated.\n- So, Alex and Casey cheated.\n- But then, both Alex and Casey are lying, which is okay because only Blake is truthful.\n\nCase 2: Casey cheated.\n- Then, Alex didn't cheat.\n- So, Alex is lying because he said he didn't cheat, but he actually didn't. Wait, no. If Alex didn't cheat, then Alex's statement \"I didn't cheat, and Casey didn't cheat either\" would be partially true. But since we're assuming Alex is lying, his entire statement must be false. So, if Alex didn't cheat, but he said both he and Casey didn't, then he's telling the truth, which contradicts because we're assuming he's lying.\n\nTherefore, Case 2 is invalid because if Casey cheated and Alex didn't, Alex's statement would be partially true, making him not a liar.\n\nThus, only Case 1 is possible: Alex and Casey cheated, Blake is truthful.\n\nBut wait, in this scenario, both Alex and Casey cheated, but only Blake is truthful. However, the problem states that exactly one person is telling the truth, so this fits.\n\nBut let's hold on a second. Let's check Scenario 3 to see if it also fits.\n\n**Scenario 3: Casey is telling the truth.**\n\nIf Casey is truthful, then both parts of his statement are true:\n1. I didn't cheat.\n2. Either Alex or Blake did.\n\nSince exactly one person is telling the truth, both Alex and Blake must be lying.\n\nLet's see what Alex and Blake said.\n\nAlex: \"I didn't cheat, and Casey didn't cheat either.\"\n\nIf Alex is lying, then at least one part is false. Since Casey didn't cheat (from Casey's truthful statement), the only part that can be false is the first part, meaning Alex cheated.\n\nBlake: \"If Alex cheated, then Casey cheated too.\"\n\nIf Blake is lying, then the statement is false. A false conditional can occur in two ways:\n- The antecedent is true, and the consequent is false.\n- The entire statement is a contradiction, but in this case, it's a conditional, so the only way for it to be false is if the antecedent is true, and the consequent is false.\n\nSo, for Blake's statement to be false:\n- Alex cheated (antecedent is true), and Casey did not cheat (consequent is false).\n\nBut from Casey's truthful statement, Casey didn't cheat. So, if Alex cheated, and Casey didn't, then Blake's statement is indeed false. Therefore, this scenario holds.\n\nSo, in this case:\n- Casey is truthful.\n- Alex is lying, so he cheated.\n- Blake is lying, so his statement is false, implying Alex cheated, and Casey didn't.\n\nThis scenario also fits because only Casey is telling the truth, and the others are lying.\n\nWait, but in this scenario, only Casey is truthful, which satisfies the condition. So, this is another possible solution.\n\nBut now we have two possible scenarios where only one person is truthful:\n1. Blake is truthful, and both Alex and Casey cheated.\n2. Casey is truthful, and Alex cheated, while Casey didn't, and Blake lied by saying that if Alex cheated, Casey would too.\n\nBut wait, in the first scenario, both Alex and Casey cheated, but in the second scenario, only Alex cheated.\n\nSo, which one is correct?\n\nWait, let's re-examine Scenario 2.\n\nIn Scenario 2, if Blake is truthful, then:\n- If Alex cheats, Casey does too.\n- Since only Blake is truthful, Alex and Casey are lying.\n- If Alex is lying, he either cheated or Casey did.\n- If Casey is lying, he either cheated or neither did.\n\nBut if Alex cheated, then Casey must cheat, making both Alex and Casey liars. If Casey didn't cheat, then Alex is lying, so Casey must have cheated. But Casey's statement would then be a lie because he said he didn't cheat, but he did, and the second part is \"either Alex or Blake did,\" which is true because Alex did. But since Casey is lying, the second part must be false, meaning neither Alex nor Blake did. But if Alex did, that's a contradiction.\n\nWait, this is getting too tangled. Let me try to map it out step by step.\n\nIn Scenario 2: Blake is truthful.\n\n- Alex is lying: So, either Alex cheated or Casey did.\n- Casey is lying: So, either Casey cheated or neither did.\n\nIf Alex cheated:\n- Then, according to Blake, Casey must have cheated.\n- So, both Alex and Casey cheated.\n- Then, Casey's statement is a lie because he said he didn't cheat.\n- The second part of Casey's statement is \"either Alex or Blake did,\" which is true because Alex did, but since Casey is lying, this part must be false. Therefore, neither Alex nor Blake did, which contradicts because Alex did.\n\nTherefore, this leads to a contradiction. So, if Alex cheated, the scenario is invalid.\n\nIf Casey cheated:\n- Then, Alex didn't cheat.\n- Alex is lying because he said he didn't cheat, but he actually didn't. Wait, if Alex didn't cheat, then his statement \"I didn't cheat, and Casey didn't cheat either\" is partially true. But since we're assuming Alex is lying, his entire statement must be false. So, if Alex didn't cheat, but he said both he and Casey didn't, then he's telling the truth, which contradicts because we're assuming he's lying.\n\nTherefore, Scenario 2 leads to a contradiction as well.\n\nSo, only Scenario 3 is possible: Casey is truthful, Alex is lying, and Blake is lying.\n\nIn this case:\n- Casey didn't cheat.\n- Either Alex or Blake did.\n- Since only Casey is truthful, Alex and Blake are lying.\n\nIf Alex is lying, then either he cheated or Casey did. But Casey didn't cheat, so Alex must have cheated.\n\nIf Blake is lying, then his statement \"If Alex cheated, then Casey cheats\" is false. For a conditional to be false, the antecedent must be true, and the consequent must be false. So, Alex cheated, and Casey didn't.\n\nThis fits perfectly because:\n- Alex cheated.\n- Casey didn't cheat.\n- Either Alex or Blake did (since Alex did).\n- Only Casey is telling the truth.\n\nTherefore, the only consistent scenario is that Alex cheated, and Casey didn't, with Casey being the only one telling the truth.\n\nWait, but let me double-check.\n\nCasey's statement: \"I didn't cheat, but either Alex or Blake did.\" Since Casey is truthful, both parts are true. So, Casey didn't cheat, and either Alex or Blake did.\n\nAlex's statement: \"I didn't cheat, and Casey didn't cheat either.\" Since Alex is lying, either he cheated or Casey did. But Casey didn't cheat, so Alex must have cheated.\n\nBlake's statement: \"If Alex cheated, then Casey cheats too.\" Since Blake is lying, the statement is false. Therefore, Alex cheated, and Casey didn't. This makes Blake's statement false, as required.\n\nSo, in this scenario:\n- Alex cheated.\n- Casey didn't cheat.\n- Blake lied.\n\nAnd only Casey is telling the truth, which fits the condition.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that Alex cheated on the exam.\n</think>\n\nAlex cheated on the exam.\n\nDONE."

    "solution": "Solve this problem step by step. End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: Three friends, Alex, Blake, and Casey, are suspected of cheating on an exam. During investigation, they made the following statements:\n\nAlex: 'I didn't cheat, and Casey didn't cheat either.'\nBlake: 'If Alex cheated, then Casey cheated too.'\nCasey: 'I didn't cheat, but either Alex or Blake did.'\n\nIf exactly one of them is telling the truth, who cheated on the exam? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I've got this problem here about three friends\u2014Alex, Blake, and Casey\u2014who are suspected of cheating on an exam. They each made different statements, and I need to figure out who actually cheated, given that exactly one of them is telling the truth. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me list out what each person said:\n\n- **Alex:** \"I didn't cheat, and Casey didn't cheat either.\"\n- **Blake:** \"If Alex cheated, then Casey cheated too.\"\n- **Casey:** \"I didn't cheat, but either Alex or Blake did.\"\n\nNow, the key point is that exactly one of them is telling the truth. That means two of them are lying, and one is truthful. My goal is to figure out who is lying and who is telling the truth, and consequently, determine who cheated.\n\nLet me denote the following:\n\n- Let A = Alex cheated\n- Let C = Casey cheated\n- Let B = Blake cheated\n\nBut wait, actually, the problem is about who is telling the truth, not necessarily who cheated. So perhaps I should think in terms of their statements being true or false, depending on their honesty.\n\nLet me rephrase the statements as logical propositions:\n\n1. **Alex's Statement (A):** \u00acA \u2227 \u00acC\n   - \"I didn't cheat, and Casey didn't cheat either.\"\n\n2. **Blake's Statement (B):** A \u2192 C\n   - \"If Alex cheated, then Casey cheated too.\"\n\n3. **Casey's Statement (C):** \u00acC \u2227 (A \u2228 B)\n   - \"I didn't cheat, but either Alex or Blake did.\"\n\nGiven that exactly one of them is telling the truth, so exactly one of A, B, C is true, and the other two are false.\n\nLet me consider each possibility where one statement is true, and the other two are false.\n\n**Case 1:** Alex's Statement is true (A = True), Blake's and Casey's are false.\n\n- A = True: So Alex didn't cheat, and Casey didn't cheat either. So \u00acA \u2227 \u00acC is True.\n\n- B is false: So A \u2192 C is false. In logic, A \u2192 C is equivalent to \u00acA \u2228 C. So if B is false, then \u00acA \u2228 C is false. Since A is True (\u00acA is False), then C must be False for \u00acA \u2228 C to be False.\n\n- C is false: So \u00acC is True, meaning Casey cheated. Also, (A \u2228 B) must be true because Casey's statement is \u00acC \u2227 (A \u2228 B). But since C is False, \u00acC is True, and (A \u2228 B) must also be True. However, in this case, A is True, so (A \u2228 B) is True regardless of B. So Casey's statement would be True, but we assumed Casey's statement is False. This is a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, Case 1 is impossible.\n\n**Case 2:** Blake's Statement is true (B = True), Alex's and Casey's are false.\n\n- B = True: So A \u2192 C is True. As before, A \u2192 C is equivalent to \u00acA \u2228 C. So if B is True, then either \u00acA is True or C is True.\n\n- A is false: So Alex's statement is false. Alex said \u00acA \u2227 \u00acC, so if A is false, then \u00acA is True, but Alex's statement is false, meaning \u00acA \u2227 \u00acC is False. Since \u00acA is True, \u00acC must be False for the conjunction to be False. So \u00acC is False \u2192 C is True.\n\n- C is true: So Casey cheated. Now, let's check Casey's statement. Casey said \u00acC \u2227 (A \u2228 B). Since C is True, \u00acC is False, so Casey's statement is False, which aligns with our assumption.\n\nSo in this case:\n\n- Alex is lying: A is False, so Alex didn't cheat, but he lied about Casey not cheating. So Casey did cheat.\n\n- Blake is telling the truth: His statement holds because A is False, so A \u2192 C is True (since False \u2192 anything is True).\n\n- Casey is lying: His statement is False because he cheated, so \u00acC is False, making his entire statement False.\n\nThis scenario satisfies the condition that exactly one is telling the truth (Blake), and the other two are lying.\n\nLet me check if there's another possibility just to be thorough.\n\n**Case 3:** Casey's Statement is true (C = True), Alex's and Blake's are false.\n\n- C = True: So Casey didn't cheat, but either Alex or Blake did. So \u00acC is False, and (A \u2228 B) is True.\n\n- A is false: So Alex's statement is false. Alex said \u00acA \u2227 \u00acC. Since A is False, \u00acA is True, but \u00acC is False because C is True. So the conjunction is False, which aligns with Alex lying.\n\n- B is false: Blake's statement is false. Blake said A \u2192 C, which is equivalent to \u00acA \u2228 C. Since A is False, \u00acA is True, so A \u2192 C is True. But Blake is lying, so A \u2192 C must be False. This is a contradiction because if A is False, A \u2192 C is True.\n\nTherefore, Case 3 is impossible.\n\nSo the only possible scenario is Case 2, where Blake is telling the truth, and Alex and Casey are lying.\n\nIn this scenario:\n\n- Alex is lying: So he either cheated or Casey cheated. But since we know Blake is telling the truth, and Alex is lying, Alex must have lied about both not cheating and Casey not cheating. Since Alex is lying, either he cheated, or Casey cheated, or both. But since Blake is truthful, and his statement A \u2192 C is True (because A is False), so if A is False, C can be either True or False. But in this case, we've determined that Casey is lying, which implies that C is True (because Casey said he didn't cheat, but he's lying, so he did cheat).\n\nWait, hold on. Let me clarify:\n\nIf Casey is lying, his statement \u00acC \u2227 (A \u2228 B) is False. Since he's lying, either \u00acC is False (so C is True) or (A \u2228 B) is False. But since we already have A is False, and B is True (Blake is telling the truth), (A \u2228 B) is True. So to make Casey's statement False, \u00acC must be False, so C is True.\n\nTherefore, Casey cheated.\n\nBut wait, in our earlier analysis, in Case 2, we assumed B is True, so A is False, and C is True.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\n- Blake is truthful: A \u2192 C is True (since A is False, it's True regardless).\n\n- Alex is lying: So either A is True or C is True (but since A is False, C must be True).\n\n- Casey is lying: So either C is True or (A \u2228 B) is False. Since C is True, Casey's statement is False, which is consistent.\n\nTherefore, the only scenario where exactly one person is telling the truth is when Blake is truthful, and both Alex and Casey are lying.\n\nThus, the cheater is Casey.\n\nWait, but hold on. If Casey is lying, and he said \"I didn't cheat, but either Alex or Blake did,\" then since he's lying, the negation is \"I cheated, and it's not the case that either Alex or Blake did.\" Which would mean that neither Alex nor Blake cheated. But we already have that Alex is lying, so Alex didn't cheat, but Casey did. Hmm, this seems conflicting.\n\nWait, no. Let's re-examine Casey's statement:\n\nCasey said: \"I didn't cheat, but either Alex or Blake did.\" So \u00acC \u2227 (A \u2228 B).\n\nIf Casey is lying, then \u00ac(\u00acC \u2227 (A \u2228 B)) is True. Which is equivalent to C \u2228 \u00ac(A \u2228 B).\n\nWhich can be written as C \u2228 (\u00acA \u2227 \u00acB).\n\nSo, if Casey is lying, either he cheated (C is True), or he didn't cheat (C is False), but neither Alex nor Blake cheated (\u00acA \u2227 \u00acB).\n\nBut in our scenario, we have B is True (Blake is truthful), so \u00acB is False. Therefore, \u00ac(A \u2228 B) is \u00acA \u2227 \u00acB, which is False because B is True.\n\nTherefore, Casey's lie would require C \u2228 (False), so C must be True. Therefore, Casey cheated.\n\nSo, in this scenario:\n\n- Casey cheated.\n\n- Alex didn't cheat (because he's lying about both not cheating).\n\n- Blake didn't cheat because he's truthful, and his statement is A \u2192 C, which is True because A is False.\n\nWait, but if Blake is truthful, and he said \"If Alex cheated, then Casey cheated too,\" which is True because A is False, so the implication is True regardless.\n\nBut in this case, Blake didn't cheat because he's truthful, right? Because if he cheated, he would be lying, but he's telling the truth.\n\nWait, no. The problem doesn't specify that cheaters lie; rather, it's about their statements. So if someone is truthful, they didn't cheat, or if they did, their statement would still be true.\n\nBut in this scenario, Blake is truthful, so he didn't cheat. Alex is lying, so he didn't cheat either. Casey is lying, so he did cheat.\n\nTherefore, only Casey cheated.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n- Blake is truthful: So his statement holds, meaning if Alex cheated, Casey would too. But since Alex didn't cheat, Blake's statement is still true.\n\n- Alex is lying: So he either cheated or Casey cheated. Since we know Casey did cheat, Alex lied about both not cheating.\n\n- Casey is lying: So he either cheated or neither Alex nor Blake cheated. Since he cheated, that's why his statement is a lie.\n\nTherefore, the only person who cheated is Casey.\n</think>\n\nThe only scenario where exactly one person is telling the truth is when Blake is truthful, and both Alex and Casey are lying. This leads us to the conclusion that Casey cheated on the exam.\n\n**Answer:** Casey cheated on the exam.\n\nDONE."

They're all suspected of cheating on an exam. Each of them made a statement, and I need to figure out who cheated, given that exactly one of them is telling the truth.\n\nLet me break down their statements first:\n\n1. **Alex** says: \"I didn't cheat, and Casey didn't cheat either.\"\n   - So, Alex is claiming two things here: he didn't cheat, and Casey also didn't cheat.\n\n2. **Blake** says: \"If Alex cheated, then Casey cheated too.\"\n   - Blake's statement is a conditional one. It's saying that if Alex cheated, then Casey must also cheat.\n\n3. **Casey** says: \"I didn't cheat, but either Alex or Blake did.\"\n   - Casey is making two claims: he didn't cheat, and that either Alex or Blake did cheat.\n\nNow, the tricky part is that exactly one of them is telling the truth. So, out of the three statements, only one is true, and the other two are false. My job is to figure out who is lying and who is telling the truth, and based on that, determine who cheated.\n\nLet me approach this step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Assume each person is telling the truth one by one and see if it leads to a consistent scenario.**\n\nThere are three possibilities:\n\n1. **Alex is telling the truth.**\n2. **Blake is telling the truth.**\n3. **Casey is telling the truth.**\n\nI'll analyze each case to see if it holds up under scrutiny.\n\n**Case 1: Alex is telling the truth.**\n\nIf Alex is telling the truth, then both parts of his statement must be true. So:\n\n- Alex didn't cheat.\n- Casey didn't cheat.\n\nIf both are true, then neither Alex nor Casey cheated. Now, let's see what Blake's statement would imply in this scenario.\n\nBlake's statement: \"If Alex cheated, then Casey cheated too.\"\n\nBut since Alex didn't cheat (as per Alex's truthful statement), the conditional statement \"If Alex cheated, then Casey cheated\" is automatically true, regardless of Casey's actual actions. However, Blake's entire statement is a conditional, but since the antecedent (Alex cheating) is false, the entire statement is true.\n\nWait, that's a problem. If Alex is telling the truth, then Blake's statement is also true because the conditional holds when the \"if\" part is false. So, in this case, both Alex and Blake would be telling the truth, which contradicts the condition that exactly one person is telling the truth.\n\nTherefore, **Case 1 is invalid** because it results in two truths, not one.\n\n**Case 2: Blake is telling the truth.**\n\nIf Blake is telling the truth, then his statement \"If Alex cheated, then Casey cheat too\" must be true.\n\nLet's analyze the implications.\n\n- If Alex cheated, Casey must also cheat.\n\nNow, let's consider what Alex and Casey are saying in this scenario.\n\nAlex claims: \"I didn't cheat, and Casey didn't cheat either.\"\n\nIf Alex is lying, then at least one part of his statement is false. Since we're assuming Blake is telling the truth, and only one person is truthful, Alex must be lying. Therefore, either Alex cheated, or Casey cheated, or both.\n\nBut let's dig deeper.\n\nSince Blake is telling the truth, and only he is truthful, Alex and Casey must both be lying.\n\nSo, Alex is lying: His statement that \"I didn't cheat, and Casey didn't cheat either\" is false. This means that either he cheated, or Casey cheated, or both.\n\nCasey is also lying: His statement that \"I didn't cheat, but either Alex or Blake did\" is false. So, it's not true that he didn't cheat, and it's not true that either Alex or Blake did. Therefore, both Casey didn't cheat, and neither Alex nor Blake did. Wait, that's confusing.\n\nWait, let's parse Casey's lie.\n\nCasey's statement is: \"I didn't cheat, but either Alex or Blake did.\"\n\nIf Casey is lying, then the entire statement is false. So, the negation of his statement would be: \"I did cheat, and it's not the case that either Alex or Blake did.\" But that seems a bit messy. Alternatively, the statement is a conjunction: \"I didn't cheat\" AND \"either Alex or Blake did.\" If the entire statement is false, then at least one part is false. So, either Casey did cheat, or the part about \"either Alex or Blake did\" is false.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to break it down.\n\nCasey's statement: (\u00acC) \u2227 (A \u2228 B), where C is cheating, A is Alex cheating, B is Blake cheating.\n\nIf Casey is lying, then (\u00acC) \u2227 (A \u2228 B) is false. So, the negation would be \u00ac(\u00acC \u2227 (A \u2228 B)) = C \u2227 \u00ac(A \u2228 B). Which means, Casey cheated AND it's not the case that either Alex or Blake cheated. So, Casey cheated, and both Alex and Blake didn't cheat.\n\nBut wait, if Blake is telling the truth, and only Blake is truthful, then Alex and Casey are lying. So, if Casey is lying, then according to Casey's lie, he did cheat, and neither Alex nor Blake did. But if Blake is telling the truth, and only Blake is truthful, then Blake must be the only one who didn't cheat. Wait, this is getting tangled.\n\nLet me try to map it out.\n\nAssume Blake is truthful, so:\n\n- If Alex cheated, then Casey must cheat too.\n\nBut we also have:\n\n- Alex is lying, so either Alex cheated, or Casey cheated, or both.\n\n- Casey is lying, so his statement is false. As per Casey's lie, we have:\n\nCasey's statement: (\u00acC) \u2227 (A \u2228 B) is false.\n\nSo, \u00ac(\u00acC \u2227 (A \u2228 B)) = C \u2227 \u00ac(A \u2228 B). So, Casey did cheat, and neither Alex nor Blake did.\n\nBut if Casey did cheat, and neither Alex nor Blake did, then according to Blake's truthful statement, since Alex didn't cheat, the conditional \"If Alex cheated, then Casey cheat too\" is automatically true because the \"if\" part is false. So, Blake's statement holds.\n\nBut wait, if Casey did cheat, and neither Alex nor Blake did, then:\n\n- Alex didn't cheat (as per Alex's lie, since Alex is lying, it's possible that Alex didn't cheat, but Casey did).\n\n- Casey did cheat.\n\n- Blake didn't cheat.\n\nBut Blake is telling the truth, so his statement is true, which aligns with the scenario.\n\nBut let's check if this is consistent.\n\nIf Alex didn't cheat, then Blake's statement is true because the conditional holds when the \"if\" is false.\n\nIf Casey did cheat, then Casey's statement is a lie because he said he didn't cheat, which is false, and he also said that either Alex or Blake did, but in reality, neither did. So, Casey's statement is entirely false, which is consistent.\n\nSo, in this scenario:\n\n- Alex didn't cheat (but he's lying about it, so he's innocent).\n\n- Casey did cheat.\n\n- Blake didn't cheat, but he's telling the truth.\n\nWait, but if Blake didn't cheat, then he's innocent, and he's the only one telling the truth.\n\nBut wait, let's see if this holds up.\n\nAlex: \"I didn't cheat, and Casey didn't cheat either.\" \u2013 Alex is lying because he didn't cheat, but Casey did. So, his statement is partially true and partially false? Wait, no. Alex's statement is a conjunction: both parts must be true for the whole statement to be true. Since Casey did cheat, the second part is false, making Alex's entire statement false. So, Alex is lying.\n\nBlake: \"If Alex cheated, then Casey cheat too.\" \u2013 Since Alex didn't cheat, the conditional is true regardless. So, Blake is telling the truth.\n\nCasey: \"I didn't cheat, but either Alex or Blake did.\" \u2013 Casey did cheat, so the first part is false, and in reality, neither Alex nor Blake did, making the second part false as well. So, Casey's entire statement is false.\n\nThis scenario fits: exactly one person (Blake) is telling the truth, and the other two are lying. So, this seems possible.\n\nBut wait, let's check if there's another possibility.\n\n**Case 3: Casey is telling the truth.**\n\nIf Casey is telling the truth, then both parts of his statement must be true:\n\n- Casey didn't cheat.\n\n- Either Alex or Blake did cheat.\n\nSo, Casey is innocent, and at least one of Alex or Blake is guilty.\n\nNow, let's see what this implies for the other statements.\n\nAlex's statement: \"I didn't cheat, and Casey didn't cheat either.\" \u2013 If Alex is lying, then either he cheated, or Casey did, or both.\n\nBut in this case, Casey didn't cheat (as per Casey's truthful statement), so if Alex is lying, it must be because he cheated.\n\nSo, if Alex is lying, he must have cheated.\n\nBlake's statement: \"If Alex cheated, then Casey cheat too.\" \u2013 Since Alex did cheat (as per Alex's lie), then according to Blake's statement, Casey must also cheat.\n\nBut wait, in this scenario, Casey is telling the truth, so Casey didn't cheat. So, if Alex cheated, Blake's statement would require Casey to cheat, but Casey didn't. Therefore, Blake's statement would be false.\n\nSo, let's map it out.\n\nCasey is truthful:\n\n- Casey didn't cheat.\n\n- At least one of Alex or Blake did.\n\nNow, Alex is lying:\n\n- Alex cheated, because Casey didn't cheat, so the only way Alex's statement is false is if Alex cheated.\n\nBlake's statement: \"If Alex cheat, then Casey cheat.\" \u2013 Since Alex did cheat, and Casey didn't, Blake's statement is false.\n\nSo, in this scenario:\n\n- Casey is truthful.\n\n- Alex is lying.\n\n- Blake is lying.\n\nThis fits because exactly one person (Casey) is telling the truth.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let's check if this is consistent.\n\nIf Alex cheated, then according to Blake's statement, Casey must cheat too. But Casey didn't cheat, so Blake's statement is false. So, Blake is lying.\n\nAlex cheated, so Alex is lying.\n\nCasey didn't cheat, so Casey is telling the truth.\n\nThis seems consistent as well.\n\nBut wait, earlier in Case 2, we had a scenario where Blake is telling the truth, and Casey cheated. Now, in Case 3, Casey is telling the truth, and Alex cheated.\n\nSo, which one is it?\n\nWait, but the problem says that exactly one is telling the truth, so both scenarios satisfy that condition. But we need to determine who actually cheated.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that in Case 2, Casey cheated, but in Case 3, Alex cheated.\n\nWait, no, let's clarify.\n\nIn Case 2:\n\n- Blake is truthful.\n\n- Casey cheated.\n\nIn Case 3:\n\n- Casey is truthful.\n\n- Alex cheated.\n\nSo, both scenarios are possible, but we need to see which one is consistent with all statements.\n\nWait, but let's see.\n\nIn Case 2:\n\n- Blake is truthful: If Alex cheat, then Casey cheat.\n\nBut Alex didn't cheat (since Alex is lying), so the conditional is true.\n\nBut in this case, Casey did cheat, so it's consistent.\n\nIn Case 3:\n\n- Casey is truthful: He didn't cheat, but either Alex or Blake did.\n\nSo, Alex or Blake cheated.\n\nIf Alex is lying, he must have cheated because he said he didn't, and Casey didn't, so Alex must have cheated.\n\nSo, in this case, Alex cheated, and Blake is lying.\n\nBut wait, let's see if both cases are possible or if one is invalid.\n\nWait, in Case 2, we have:\n\n- Blake is truthful.\n\n- Casey cheated.\n\nBut let's check if this is possible.\n\nIf Casey cheated, then according to Blake's statement, if Alex cheated, Casey does too. But in this case, Alex didn't cheat, so it's okay.\n\nBut in Case 3, Alex cheated, and Casey didn't, but Casey is truthful, so that's also possible.\n\nWait, but the problem is to find who cheated, given that exactly one is telling the truth.\n\nSo, both scenarios satisfy the condition, but the cheating person is different in each case.\n\nWait, but perhaps I missed something.\n\nWait, let's think again.\n\nIn Case 2:\n\n- Blake is truthful.\n\n- Alex is lying: So, Alex didn't cheat, but Casey did.\n\n- Casey is lying: So, Casey did cheat, and neither Alex nor Blake did.\n\nBut wait, if Casey did cheat, and neither Alex nor Blake did, then Blake's statement is true because the conditional holds when Alex didn't cheat.\n\nBut in this case, Casey did cheat, and Blake is truthful.\n\nIn Case 3:\n\n- Casey is truthful.\n\n- Alex is lying: So, Alex cheated.\n\n- Blake is lying: So, since Alex cheated, Blake's statement would require Casey to cheat, but Casey didn't, so Blake's statement is false.\n\nSo, in this case, Alex cheated, and Casey didn't.\n\nBut the problem is to find who cheated, given that exactly one is truthful.\n\nSo, both scenarios are possible:\n\nEither:\n\n- Blake is truthful, Casey cheated.\n\nOr:\n\n- Casey is truthful, Alex cheated.\n\nBut wait, the problem is to determine who cheated, so perhaps both are possible, but the question is to find who is the cheater given that exactly one is truthful.\n\nWait, but perhaps I need to consider that in one scenario, the cheater is Casey, and in the other, it's Alex.\n\nBut the problem says \"who cheated on the exam,\" implying that only one person cheated.\n\nWait, but in the first scenario, only Casey cheated.\n\nIn the second scenario, only Alex cheated.\n\nBut in the second scenario, Blake didn't cheat, because Casey is truthful, and only Alex cheated.\n\nWait, but in the first scenario, only Casey cheated, and in the second, only Alex cheated.\n\nBut both scenarios satisfy the condition of exactly one person being truthful.\n\nSo, how do we determine which scenario is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering that in Case 2, Casey did cheat, but in reality, if Blake is truthful, and only he is truthful, then:\n\n- Alex didn't cheat (because if Alex did, Casey would too, but Alex didn't, so Casey didn't have to).\n\nWait, no, that's not necessarily the case.\n\nWait, let's clarify.\n\nIf Blake is truthful, then his statement is \"If Alex cheat, then Casey cheat.\" But if Alex didn't cheat, the statement is true regardless.\n\nBut if Alex didn't cheat, then Casey could have cheated or not.\n\nBut in Case 2, we have:\n\n- Blake is truthful.\n\n- Alex is lying: So, Alex didn't cheat, but Casey did.\n\n- Casey is lying: So, Casey did cheat, and neither Alex nor Blake did.\n\nWait, but if Casey did cheat, and neither Alex nor Blake did, then:\n\n- Alex didn't cheat.\n\n- Casey did cheat.\n\n- Blake didn't cheat.\n\nBut Blake is telling the truth, so that's okay.\n\nBut in this scenario, only Casey cheated, and only Blake is truthful.\n\nIn the other scenario:\n\n- Casey is truthful.\n\n- Alex is lying: So, Alex cheated.\n\n- Blake is lying: So, since Alex cheated, Blake's statement would require Casey to cheat, but Casey didn't, so Blake's statement is false.\n\nThus, in this scenario, only Alex cheated, and only Casey is truthful.\n\nSo, both scenarios are possible, but the problem is to find who cheated.\n\nWait, but the problem states that exactly one of them is telling the truth, so both scenarios are possible, but the cheating person is different in each.\n\nBut the problem asks \"who cheated on the exam?\" So, perhaps both are possible, but the answer is that either Alex or Casey cheated.\n\nWait, but that can't be, because the problem implies that only one person cheated.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to check if both scenarios are possible or if one is invalid.\n\nWait, in Case 2, when Blake is truthful:\n\n- Blake: truthful.\n\n- Alex: lying.\n\n- Casey: lying.\n\nSo, Alex didn't cheat, but Casey did.\n\nBut if Alex didn't cheat, then Blake's statement is true.\n\nBut in this case, Casey did cheat, so Casey is lying.\n\nBut in Case 3:\n\n- Casey: truthful.\n\n- Alex: lying.\n\n- Blake: lying.\n\nSo, Alex did cheat, and Casey didn't.\n\nBut in this case, since Alex did cheat, Blake's statement would require Casey to cheat, but Casey didn't, so Blake is lying.\n\nSo, both scenarios are possible.\n\nBut the problem is to find who cheated, given that exactly one is truthful.\n\nSo, perhaps both Alex and Casey are possible cheaters, but the problem states that exactly one person cheated.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"exactly one of them is telling the truth,\" not that exactly one person cheated.\n\nSo, perhaps both scenarios are possible, but the problem is to determine who cheated, given that exactly one is truthful.\n\nWait, but in both scenarios, only one person cheated, but different people.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to see if both scenarios are possible or if one is invalid.\n\nWait, in Case 2:\n\n- Blake is truthful.\n\n- Alex didn't cheat.\n\n- Casey did cheat.\n\nBut if Alex didn't cheat, then Blake's statement is true because the conditional holds.\n\nBut in this case, Casey did cheat, so Casey is lying.\n\nIn Case 3:\n\n- Casey is truthful.\n\n- Alex did cheat.\n\n- Blake is lying.\n\nSo, both scenarios are possible.\n\nBut the problem is to find who cheated, so perhaps the answer is either Alex or Casey.\n\nWait, but the problem implies that only one person cheated.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to see which scenario is consistent.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to check the truthfulness of the statements in both scenarios.\n\nIn Case 2:\n\n- Blake is truthful.\n\n- Alex is lying: So, Alex didn't cheat, but Casey did.\n\n- Casey is lying: So, Casey did cheat, and neither Alex nor Blake did.\n\nBut if Casey did cheat, and neither Alex nor Blake did, then:\n\n- Alex didn't cheat.\n\n- Casey did.\n\n- Blake didn't.\n\nBut Blake is truthful, so that's okay.\n\nIn Case 3:\n\n- Casey is truthful.\n\n- Alex is lying: So, Alex did cheat.\n\n- Blake is lying: So, since Alex did cheat, Blake's statement would require Casey to cheat, but Casey didn't, so Blake is lying.\n\nSo, both scenarios are possible.\n\nBut the problem is to find who cheated, so perhaps the answer is that either Alex or Casey cheated, depending on who is telling the truth.\n\nBut the problem states that exactly one person is telling the truth, so both scenarios are possible, but the cheating person is different.\n\nWait, but perhaps I need to consider that in one scenario, only one person cheated, and in the other,"

    "solution": "Solve this problem step by step. End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: Three friends, Alex, Blake, and Casey, are suspected of cheating on an exam. During investigation, they made the following statements:\n\nAlex: 'I didn't cheat, and Casey didn't cheat either.'\nBlake: 'If Alex cheated, then Casey cheated too.'\nCasey: 'I didn't cheat, but either Alex or Blake did.'\n\nIf exactly one of them is telling the truth, who cheated on the exam? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I've got this logic puzzle here about three friends: Alex, Blake, and Casey. They're all suspected of cheating on an exam. Each of them made a statement, and I need to figure out who cheated, given that exactly one of them is telling the truth. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's list out what each person said:\n\n- **Alex**: \"I didn't cheat, and Casey didn't cheat either.\"\n- **Blake**: \"If Alex cheated, then Casey cheated too.\"\n- **Casey**: \"I didn't cheat, but either Alex or Blake did.\"\n\nOkay, so each of them is making a statement about whether they cheated or not, and possibly connecting it to others. Now, the key point is that exactly one of them is telling the truth. That means two of them are lying, and one is truthful. My goal is to figure out who is lying, who is truthful, and consequently, who cheated.\n\nLet me denote the following:\n\n- Let A = Alex cheated.\n- Let C = Casey cheated.\n- Let B = Blake cheated.\n\nBut wait, actually, the problem is about who didn't cheat, but since cheating is the action, maybe it's better to think in terms of who is telling the truth or lying about their own actions and others.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to analyze each statement and see how they relate to each other.\n\nLet's start by assuming each person is the one telling the truth, one by one, and see if that leads to a consistent scenario.\n\n**Case 1: Suppose Alex is telling the truth.**\n\nIf Alex is telling the truth, then both statements he made are true:\n\n1. \"I didn't cheat.\" So, A = false.\n2. \"Casey didn't cheat either.\" So, C = false.\n\nSo, if Alex is truthful, then Alex didn't cheat, and Casey didn't cheat. Now, let's look at Blake's statement.\n\nBlake says, \"If Alex cheated, then Casey cheated too.\" But since we've established that Alex didn't cheat (A = false), the implication \"If A, then C\" is automatically true, regardless of whether Casey cheated or not. So, if Alex is truthful, Blake's statement is also true.\n\nBut wait, the problem states that exactly one person is telling the truth. If both Alex and Blake are telling the truth, that would mean two people are truthful, which contradicts the condition. Therefore, this scenario is impossible. So, Alex cannot be the one telling the truth.\n\n**Case 2: Suppose Blake is telling the truth.**\n\nIf Blake is telling the truth, then his statement is true:\n\n\"Blake: If Alex cheated, then Casey cheated too.\"\n\nSo, \"If A, then C.\" Symbolically, that's A \u2192 C.\n\nNow, let's see what this implies. If Blake is truthful, then either:\n\n- Alex did not cheat (A = false), which would make the implication vacuously true.\n- If Alex did cheat (A = true), then Casey must have cheated (C = true).\n\nSo, Blake's statement doesn't necessarily tell us whether Alex or Casey cheated directly, but it sets a condition that if Alex cheated, Casey must have as well.\n\nNow, let's look at the other statements. Let's consider Alex's statement:\n\nAlex says, \"I didn't cheat, and Casey didn't cheat either.\"\n\nIf Alex is lying, then either he cheated, or Casey cheated, or both.\n\nBut since we're assuming Blake is truthful, and possibly Alex is lying, let's see.\n\nIf Alex is lying, then his statement is false. Since his statement is a conjunction (\"I didn't cheat, and Casey didn't cheat either\"), for it to be false, at least one part must be false.\n\nSo, either:\n\n- Alex cheated (A = true), or\n- Casey cheated (C = true), or both.\n\nNow, if Blake is truthful, and if Alex is lying, then let's explore the possibilities.\n\nFrom Blake's truthful statement, if A is true, then C must also be true. So, if Alex cheated, Casey must have cheated as well.\n\nAlternatively, if A is false, then C could be either true or false.\n\nBut let's also consider Casey's statement:\n\nCasey says, \"I didn't cheat, but either Alex or Blake did.\"\n\nIf Casey is lying, then either:\n\n- Casey cheated (C = true), or\n- The part \"either Alex or Blake did\" is false, meaning neither Alex nor Blake did (i.e., both A and B are false).\n\nBut wait, Casey's statement is \"I didn't cheat, but either Alex or Blake did.\" So, for Casey's statement to be a lie, both parts must be false. That is:\n\n1. Casey did cheat (C = true).\n2. It's not the case that either Alex or Blake did (so both A and B are false).\n\nAlternatively, if Casey is telling the truth, then:\n\n1. Casey didn't cheat (C = false).\n2. Either Alex or Blake did (A or B is true).\n\nBut since we already assumed that exactly one person is telling the truth, and we're in the scenario where Blake is truthful, let's see if Casey is lying or telling the truth.\n\nIf Blake is truthful, and we're considering Casey's statement, if Casey is lying, then both C = true and (A and B = false). Let's see if that's possible.\n\nBut let's also remember that we've already assumed Blake is truthful, so we can't have both Alex and Casey lying, because that would mean only Blake is truthful, which is acceptable since exactly one is truthful.\n\nWait, no, if Blake is truthful, and both Alex and Casey are lying, then that would mean three people: Blake truthful, Alex and Casey lying. But the problem says exactly one is telling the truth, so this scenario is invalid because we have Blake truthful and others lying, which would make one truthful person, which is acceptable. Wait, no, the problem says exactly one is telling the truth, so if Blake is truthful, and the others are lying, that's acceptable because only one is truthful.\n\nBut let's see if that holds.\n\nSo, let's suppose:\n\n- Blake is truthful: A \u2192 C.\n- Alex is lying: So, his statement is false. Therefore, either A = true or C = true (or both).\n- Casey is lying: So, his statement is false. Therefore, either C = true or (A and B) = false.\n\nNow, let's try to combine these.\n\nFrom Blake: A \u2192 C.\n\nFrom Alex lying: \u00ac(\u00acA \u2227 \u00acC) = A \u2228 C.\n\nFrom Casey lying: \u00ac(\u00acC \u2227 (A \u2227 B) = false) = \u00ac(\u00acC \u2227 (A \u2227 B)) = C \u2228 \u00ac(A \u2227 B).\n\nBut this is getting a bit complicated. Let's try to make a table.\n\nPossible combinations:\n\n1. A = false, C = false:\n   - From Blake: A \u2192 C is true (since A is false).\n   - From Alex: He said \u00acA \u2227 \u00acC, which is true, but we assumed he's lying, so this contradicts.\n   - Therefore, this is impossible.\n\n2. A = false, C = true:\n   - From Blake: A \u2192 C is true.\n   - From Alex: He said \u00acA \u2227 \u00acC, which is false (since C = true). So Alex is lying, which is consistent.\n   - From Casey: He said \u00acC \u2227 (A \u2228 B). Since C = true, \u00acC is false. So Casey's statement is false regardless of A and B. So Casey is lying, which is consistent.\n   - Now, who is telling the truth? Only Blake. So that fits the condition of exactly one truthful person.\n\n3. A = true, C = true:\n   - From Blake: A \u2192 C is true.\n   - From Alex: He said \u00acA \u2227 \u00acC, which is false (since both A and C are true). So Alex is lying.\n   - From Casey: He said \u00acC \u2227 (A \u2228 B). Since C = true, \u00acC is false. So Casey's statement is false regardless of A and B. So Casey is lying.\n   - So, only Blake is truthful. That fits.\n\n4. A = true, C = false:\n   - From Blake: A \u2192 C is false (since A is true and C is false).\n   - So Blake is lying, which contradicts our assumption that Blake is truthful.\n   - Therefore, invalid.\n\nSo, from this, the possible scenarios where Blake is truthful are:\n\n- A = false, C = true\n- A = true, C = true\n\nBut wait, let's check Casey's statement in these scenarios.\n\nIn the first case: A = false, C = true.\n\nCasey's statement: \"I didn't cheat, but either Alex or Blake did.\"\n\nSince C = true, Casey is lying, which is consistent because we've established that Casey is lying.\n\nIn the second case: A = true, C = true.\n\nCasey's statement: \"I didn't cheat, but either Alex or Blake did.\"\n\nAgain, C = true, so Casey is lying, which is consistent.\n\nSo both scenarios are possible where Blake is truthful, and Alex and Casey are lying.\n\nBut wait, the problem is to determine who cheated, not necessarily all possibilities. However, in both scenarios, both Alex and Casey are not cheating in the first case, but in the second case, both are cheating.\n\nWait, no:\n\nIn the first case: A = false, C = true.\n\nSo only Casey cheated.\n\nIn the second case: A = true, C = true.\n\nSo both Alex and Casey cheated.\n\nBut we also need to consider Blake's cheating status.\n\nWait, in the problem, each person is making a statement about their own cheating and possibly others. So, in Blake's truthful scenario, we have to determine whether Blake himself cheated.\n\nBut in our analysis, we haven't considered Blake's own cheating status yet. Let me think.\n\nIf Blake is truthful, then from his statement, A \u2192 C.\n\nBut we also need to see if Blake is lying or truthful about his own cheating.\n\nWait, actually, the problem is about who cheated, and each statement is about their own actions and possibly others. So, when considering whether someone is lying or truthful, their statement could involve both their own cheating and others'.\n\nTherefore, when we assume Blake is truthful, his statement is \"If Alex cheated, then Casey cheated too.\" But his statement doesn't directly say anything about himself. So, Blake's cheating status isn't directly tied to his statement. However, if we consider that Blake is truthful, that doesn't necessarily mean he didn't cheat; it's possible that he cheated but is still telling the truth.\n\nWait, no. If someone is truthful, it doesn't necessarily mean they didn't cheat; they could have cheated but still be telling the truth. So, Blake's statement is about Alex and Casey, not himself.\n\nTherefore, in the scenarios where Blake is truthful, Blake could be cheating or not cheating. But the problem is to find who cheated, so we need to determine the exact individuals.\n\nBut let's go back to the two scenarios:\n\n1. A = false, C = true, B = ?\n\n2. A = true, C = true, B = ?\n\nWe need to determine B's status in each case.\n\nLet's recall that in the problem, each person's statement can be analyzed for their own cheating.\n\nAlex's statement: \"I didn't cheat, and Casey didn't cheat either.\"\n\nIf Alex is lying, then either he cheated, or Casey cheated, or both.\n\nCasey's statement: \"I didn't cheat, but either Alex or Blake did.\"\n\nIf Casey is lying, then either he cheated, or it's not the case that either Alex or Blake did.\n\nSo, let's consider the first scenario:\n\n**Scenario 1: A = false, C = true, B = ?**\n\nFrom Alex's lying: Since A = false, but Alex is lying, then his statement \"I didn't cheat, and Casey didn't cheat either\" is false. Since he didn't cheat (A = false), the only way his statement is false is if Casey cheated (C = true), which is consistent.\n\nFrom Casey's lying: Casey said \"I didn't cheat, but either Alex or Blake did.\" Since C = true, he's lying, which is consistent. The statement being false means either he cheated (C = true) or it's not the case that either Alex or Blake did (A and B both false). Since C = true, the first part is true, so the entire statement is false because of the conjunction. So, Casey is lying.\n\nNow, we need to determine Blake's status.\n\nBlake's statement: \"If Alex cheated, then Casey cheated too.\" Since A = false, the implication is true regardless. So, Blake's statement is true.\n\nBut we've already assumed Blake is truthful, so that's consistent.\n\nHowever, we need to determine if Blake cheated or not.\n\nIf Blake is truthful, he could have cheated or not. But let's see if we can find out.\n\nFrom Casey's lying: \"I didn't cheat, but either Alex or Blake did.\" Since Casey is lying, the statement is false. So, either Casey cheated (which he does) or it's not the case that Alex or Blake did.\n\nBut since Casey cheated, the statement is false because he did cheat, so the part about either Alex or Blake doing it is irrelevant because the entire statement is a conjunction: \"I didn't cheat\" AND \"either Alex or Blake did.\" Since \"I didn't cheat\" is false, the entire statement is false, regardless of the second part.\n\nTherefore, from Casey's lying, we don't get information about Blake's cheating beyond what's already known.\n\nNow, let's think about Alex's lying. Since Alex is lying, and he said \"I didn't cheat, and Casey didn't cheat either,\" which is false, so either he cheated, or Casey cheated, or both. We know Casey cheated, so that part is true, but since it's a conjunction, the entire statement is false because Alex didn't cheat. So, the only way his statement is false is if Casey cheated, which he does.\n\nTherefore, in this scenario, the only cheater is Casey.\n\nNow, let's consider Blake's cheating status. Since Blake is truthful, he could be either truthful and cheating or truthful and not cheating.\n\nBut wait, if Blake is truthful, his statement is \"If Alex cheated, then Casey cheated too.\" Since Alex didn't cheat, Blake's statement is true regardless. So, Blake's statement doesn't give us information about his own cheating.\n\nHowever, we can look at Casey's statement. Casey said, \"I didn't cheat, but either Alex or Blake did.\" Since Casey is lying, as we established, he did cheat, and either Alex or Blake did. But since Alex didn't cheat, it must mean that Blake did.\n\nWait, that's a crucial point. Let me re-examine Casey's statement.\n\nCasey's statement: \"I didn't cheat, but either Alex or Blake did.\"\n\nSince Casey is lying, the entire statement is false. So, \"I didn't cheat\" is false (so Casey did cheat), and \"either Alex or Blake did\" is also false (so neither Alex nor Blake did).\n\nWait, no. The statement is a conjunction: (\u00acC) \u2227 (A \u2228 B). For the entire statement to be false, either \u00acC is false (so C is true), or (A \u2228 B) is false (so A and B are false).\n\nBut since we already know C is true, the entire statement is false regardless of A and B. Therefore, from Casey's lying, we only know that C is true, but not about A and B.\n\nHowever, in the scenario where A = false, C = true, and Blake is truthful, we can deduce more.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify.\n\nCasey's statement: \"I didn't cheat, but either Alex or Blake did.\"\n\nThis is a conjunction: (\u00acC) \u2227 (A \u2228 B).\n\nIf Casey is lying, then the entire statement is false. So, \u00ac[(\u00acC) \u2227 (A \u2228 B)] = C \u2228 \u00ac(A \u2228 B) = C \u2228 (\u00acA \u2227 \u00acB).\n\nSince we've established that C is true, the statement is false because \u00acC is false. Therefore, the statement is false regardless of A and B.\n\nTherefore, from Casey's lying, we only know that C is true, but not about A and B.\n\nHowever, in our scenario, we've assumed that A = false, C = true, and Blake is truthful.\n\nFrom Blake's truthful statement: A \u2192 C, which is true because A is false.\n\nNow, let's think about Blake's own cheating. Since Blake is truthful, his statement is true, but his own cheating status is not directly addressed in his statement.\n\nBut we can look at Alex's statement. Alex said, \"I didn't cheat, and Casey didn't cheat either.\" Since Alex is lying, his statement is false. So, either he cheated, or Casey cheated, or both. Since we've established that Casey cheated, the statement is false because of the conjunction.\n\nBut since Alex is lying, he could have cheated or not. However, in this scenario, we've assumed A = false, so Alex didn't cheat.\n\nTherefore, in this scenario:\n\n- Alex didn't cheat.\n- Casey did cheat.\n- Blake's status is unknown in terms of cheating, but he is truthful.\n\nWait, but the problem is to find who cheated, so we need to determine if Blake cheated or not.\n\nBut from Casey's statement, since Casey is lying, and he said \"either Alex or Blake did,\" but we know Casey did cheat, and Alex didn't cheat, so it must be that Blake did cheat.\n\nWait, let me clarify.\n\nCasey's statement: \"I didn't cheat, but either Alex or Blake did.\"\n\nIf Casey is lying, then the entire statement is false. So, the statement is false because either:\n\n- He did cheat (C = true), which makes the first part false, so the entire statement is false regardless of the second part.\n\nBut, in logic, when the statement is a conjunction, for it to be false, at least one part must be false. So, if C is true (he did cheat), then the first part is false, making the entire statement false, regardless of the second part.\n\nTherefore, from Casey's lying, we only know that he did cheat, but we don't know about Alex and Blake.\n\nHowever, in our scenario, we've assumed that A = false, so Alex didn't cheat. Therefore, since Casey is lying, and he said \"either Alex or Blake did,\" but since Alex didn't do it, and Casey did, it implies that Blake did.\n\nWait, that's a leap. Let me think carefully.\n\nCasey's statement is \"I didn't cheat, but either Alex or Blake did.\"\n\nIf Casey is lying, then the entire statement is false. So, the statement \u00acC \u2227 (A \u2228 B) is false.\n\nWhich means that either C is true (so \u00acC is false) or (A \u2228 B) is false (so A and B are false).\n\nBut since we've established that C is true, the entire statement is false because \u00acC is false.\n\nTherefore, from Casey's lying, we only know that C is true, but not about A and B.\n\nHowever"

    "solution": "Solve this problem step by step. End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: Three friends, Alex, Blake, and Casey, are suspected of cheating on an exam. During investigation, they made the following statements:\n\nAlex: 'I didn't cheat, and Casey didn't cheat either.'\nBlake: 'If Alex cheated, then Casey cheated too.'\nCasey: 'I didn't cheat, but either Alex or Blake did.'\n\nIf exactly one of them is telling the truth, who cheated on the exam? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I've got this logic problem here about three friends: Alex, Blake, and Casey. They're all suspected of cheating on an exam, and each of them made a statement. The tricky part is that exactly one of them is telling the truth, and I need to figure out who cheated. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's list out what each person said:\n\n1. **Alex** said: \"I didn't cheat, and Casey didn't cheat either.\"\n2. **Blake** said: \"If Alex cheated, then Casey cheated too.\"\n3. **Casey** said: \"I didn't cheat, but either Alex or Blake did.\"\n\nNow, the key point is that only one of them is telling the truth. That means two of them are lying, and only one statement is true. My goal is to figure out who is telling the truth and who is lying, and from there, determine who cheated.\n\nLet me consider each possibility one by one.\n\n**Case 1: Suppose Alex is telling the truth.**\nIf Alex is telling the truth, then both Alex and Casey didn't cheat. So, Alex is honest, and Casey is also honest. But wait, if both Alex and Casey are telling the truth, that means two people are telling the truth, which contradicts the condition that only one is telling the truth. Therefore, this case is impossible. So, Alex cannot be the one telling the truth.\n\n**Case 2: Suppose Blake is telling the truth.**\nIf Blake is telling the truth, then his statement \"If Alex cheated, then Casey cheated too\" must be true. Now, since only one person is telling the truth, both Alex and Casey must be lying.\n\nLet's analyze what that means:\n- Alex is lying, so either Alex cheated or Casey cheated (or both).\n- Casey is lying, so it's not true that \"I didn't cheat, but either Alex or Blake did.\" So, Casey's statement is false, which could mean that Casey did cheat, and also, it's not the case that either Alex or Blake did.\n\nWait, this is a bit confusing. Let me break it down:\n\n- If Blake is truthful, then his implication holds: If Alex cheated, Casey cheats. But since Blake is the only one telling the truth, Alex and Casey are lying.\n- Alex's lie means that at least one of the two statements he made is false. He said, \"I didn't cheat, and Casey didn't cheat either.\" So, for Alex to be lying, either he cheated, or Casey cheated, or both.\n- Casey's lie means that either he cheated, or it's not the case that either Alex or Blake did. So, Casey's statement being false could mean that Casey did cheat, and also, it's not necessarily true that either Alex or Blake did.\n\nWait, let's think differently. If Blake is telling the truth, and only he is truthful, then:\n- Alex is lying, so Alex either cheated or Casey cheated (or both).\n- Casey is lying, so his statement \"I didn't cheat, but either Alex or Blake did\" is false. That could mean that Casey did cheat, and also, it's not the case that either Alex or Blake did. But that seems contradictory because if Casey did cheat, then either Alex or Blake must have done something, but Casey's statement is that at least one of them did. If Casey is lying, then it's not the case that either Alex or Blake did, but that contradicts the fact that Blake is telling the truth, which might imply something about Alex or Casey.\n\nI think I'm getting stuck here. Let me try another approach.\n\nSince only one person is telling the truth, and we're considering Blake as the truthful one, let's assume Blake is truthful and see if that leads to a consistent scenario.\n\nBlake: \"If Alex cheats, then Casey cheats too.\"\n\nIf Blake is truthful, then:\n- If Alex cheats, Casey must cheat.\n- If Alex doesn't cheat, Casey can either cheat or not.\n\nBut since only Blake is telling the truth, Alex and Casey must be lying.\n\nAlex is lying, so his statement \"I didn't cheat, and Casey didn't cheat either\" is false. Therefore, either Alex cheated, or Casey cheated, or both.\n\nCasey is lying, so his statement \"I didn't cheat, but either Alex or Blake did\" is false. That could mean:\n- Casey cheated, and it's not the case that either Alex or Blake did. But if Casey cheated, and Blake is telling the truth, then Blake's statement would imply that if Alex cheated, Casey does too. But since we're assuming Alex didn't cheat (because if Alex did, Casey would have to cheat, but Casey is lying, so maybe Alex didn't cheat), this is getting complicated.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to construct a truth table or consider all possibilities.\n\nLet me consider all possible scenarios where exactly one person is telling the truth.\n\n**Possibility 1: Alex is truthful, Blake and Casey are lying.**\n- Alex: \"I didn't cheat, and Casey didn't cheat either.\" If Alex is truthful, then both Alex and Casey are honest, which contradicts the condition that only one is truthful. So, this is impossible.\n\n**Possibility 2: Blake is truthful, Alex and Casey are lying.**\n- Alex is lying: So, either Alex cheated or Casey cheated.\n- Casey is lying: His statement \"I didn't cheat, but either Alex or Blake did\" is false. That means either:\n  - Casey cheated, and it's not the case that either Alex or Blake did. But if Blake is truthful, and Blake's statement is \"If Alex cheats, then Casey cheats too,\" and if Alex didn't cheat (because if Alex did, Casey would have to cheat, but Casey is lying, so maybe Alex didn't cheat), this could mean that Casey cheated, but Blake didn't do anything, which contradicts Casey's lie.\n\nAlternatively, if Casey didn't cheat, then his statement would be \"I didn't cheat, but either Alex or Blake did,\" which is false because he didn't cheat, so the second part must be false. That is, it's not the case that either Alex or Blake did. But if Blake is truthful, and Blake's statement is about Alex, then if Alex didn't cheat, Casey could be innocent, but then who did it? It can't be Casey because he's lying. So, this seems inconsistent.\n\n**Possibility 3: Casey is truthful, Alex and Blake are lying.**\n- Casey says, \"I didn't cheat, but either Alex or Blake did.\" So, Casey didn't cheat, but at least one of Alex or Blake did.\n- Alex is lying, so his statement \"I didn't cheat, and Casey didn't cheat either\" is false. Therefore, either Alex cheated, or Casey cheated, or both. But Casey is truthful, so Casey didn't cheat. Therefore, Alex must have cheated.\n- Blake is lying, so his statement \"If Alex cheated, then Casey cheat too\" is false. Since Alex cheated, Blake's implication would be true only if Casey cheated. But since Blake is lying, the implication is false, meaning that Alex cheated but Casey didn't. However, Casey is truthful, so Casey didn't cheat, which aligns with this.\n\nSo, in this scenario:\n- Casey is truthful: He didn't cheat, but either Alex or Blake did.\n- Alex cheated (as deduced from his lie and Casey's truthfulness).\n- Blake's statement is a lie, so his implication is false. Since Alex cheated, the implication would normally be true if Casey also cheated, but since it's false, Casey didn't cheat.\n\nTherefore, in this case, Alex cheated, and Casey didn't. But Casey's statement says that either Alex or Blake did, which is true because Alex did. So, this scenario works.\n\nWait, but let's double-check:\n- Casey is truthful: He didn't cheat, but either Alex or Blake did. Alex did, so it's true.\n- Alex is lying: He said he didn't cheat and Casey didn't. But he did cheat, so his statement is false.\n- Blake is lying: He said if Alex cheated, then Casey does too. But since Alex cheated and Casey didn't, Blake's statement is false.\n\nThis fits the condition that exactly one person is telling the truth (Casey), and the others are lying.\n\nAlternatively, let's check Possibility 2 again, just to make sure.\n\n**Possibility 2 Revisited: Blake is truthful, Alex and Casey are lying.**\n- Alex is lying: So, Alex cheated or Casey cheated.\n- Casey is lying: So, either Casey cheated and it's not the case that Alex or Blake did, or Casey didn't cheat and it's not the case that Alex or Blake did.\n\nBut since only one person is truthful, and we're assuming Blake is the only one, then:\n- If Casey is lying, and Casey didn't cheat (since Blake is truthful and only one person is truthful), then Casey's statement \"I didn't cheat, but either Alex or Blake did\" is false. That means it's not the case that either Alex or Blake did. But if Blake is truthful, and Blake's statement is about Alex, then if Alex didn't cheat, Blake's statement doesn't necessarily imply anything. But if Alex did cheat, then Casey would have to cheat too, which contradicts Casey's lie because Casey didn't cheat.\n\nWait, this is getting too tangled. Let me try to outline it clearly.\n\nIf Blake is truthful:\n- His statement: If Alex cheated, then Casey does too.\n- Since only Blake is truthful, Alex and Casey are lying.\n- Alex's lie: Either Alex cheated or Casey cheated.\n- Casey's lie: His statement is false. So, either:\n  - Casey cheated, and it's not the case that Alex or Blake did. But if Casey cheated, and Blake is truthful, then Blake's statement would imply that if Alex cheated, Casey does too. But if Alex didn't cheat, then Casey could cheat without violating Blake's statement. However, Casey's lie would mean that he cheated, and it's not the case that Alex or Blake did. But if Blake is truthful, and Alex didn't cheat, then Casey's cheating wouldn't necessarily be linked to Alex. This seems possible, but let's see.\n\nAlternatively, if Casey didn't cheat, then his statement \"I didn't cheat, but either Alex or Blake did\" is false. That would mean it's not the case that either Alex or Blake did. But if Blake is truthful, and if Alex didn't cheat, then maybe Blake didn't do it either. But then, who did it? Only Casey is left, but Casey didn't cheat, so this is impossible. Therefore, the only possibility is that Casey did cheat, but then his lie would mean that it's not the case that Alex or Blake did. But if Casey did cheat, and Blake is truthful, then Blake's statement would imply that if Alex cheated, Casey does too. But if Alex didn't cheat, Casey could still cheat without violating Blake's statement. However, since Casey is lying, his statement is false, so he did cheat, and it's not the case that Alex or Blake did. But if Blake is truthful, and Alex didn't cheat, then Blake didn't do it either, which would mean no one did it, which contradicts Casey's cheating. Therefore, this scenario is impossible.\n\nThus, Possibility 2 (Blake is truthful) leads to a contradiction, so it's invalid.\n\nTherefore, the only valid possibility is Possibility 3: Casey is truthful, Alex and Blake are lying.\n\nIn this scenario:\n- Casey didn't cheat.\n- Either Alex or Blake did.\n- Alex cheated (since Alex is lying about not cheating).\n- Blake's statement is a lie, so his implication is false. Since Alex cheated, Blake's statement would normally imply Casey cheated, but since it's false, Casey didn't cheat.\n\nThis fits perfectly because:\n- Exactly one person (Casey) is telling the truth.\n- Alex cheated, and Casey didn't, but Casey's truthful statement holds because either Alex or Blake did (Alex did).\n\nSo, the cheater is Alex.\n\nWait, but let me confirm again:\n\nCasey is truthful: He didn't cheat, but either Alex or Blake did. So, Alex did.\n\nBlake is lying: His statement \"If Alex cheats, then Casey does too\" is false. Since Alex did cheat, for Blake's statement to be false, Casey must not have cheated. Which aligns with Casey's truthfulness.\n\nAlex is lying: He said he didn't cheat and Casey didn't. But he did cheat, so his statement is false.\n\nTherefore, the only cheater is Alex.\n\nSo, the conclusion is that Alex cheated on the exam.\n</think>\n\nThe only scenario that fits is when Casey is telling the truth, and Alex is the cheater. \n\n**Answer:** Alex cheated on the exam.\n\nDONE."

During investigation, they made the following statements:\n\nAlex: 'I didn't cheat, and Casey didn't cheat either.'\nBlake: 'If Alex cheated, then Casey cheated too.'\nCasey: 'I didn't cheat, but either Alex or Blake did.'\n\nIf exactly one of them is telling the truth, who cheated on the exam? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this logic puzzle here involving three friends: Alex, Blake, and Casey. They're all suspected of cheating on an exam. Each of them made a statement, and I need to figure out who cheated, given that exactly one of them is telling the truth.\n\nFirst, let me list out their statements to keep things clear.\n\n**Alex:** \"I didn't cheat, and Casey didn't cheat either.\"\n\n**Blake:** \"If Alex cheated, then Casey cheated too.\"\n\n**Casey:** \"I didn't cheat, but either Alex or Blake did.\"\n\nAnd the key piece of information is that **exactly one** of them is telling the truth. So, two are lying, and one is truthful. My goal is to determine who the cheater is based on these statements.\n\nTo approach this, I think I'll analyze each possibility step by step. I'll consider each scenario where one person is telling the truth and see if the other two's statements hold up as lies. If it does, then that scenario is possible, and I can identify the cheater.\n\nLet's denote the following:\n\n- **A:** Alex cheated.\n- **B:** Blake cheated.\n- **C:** Casey cheated.\n\nNow, let's consider each case where one person is telling the truth.\n\n**Case 1: Alex is telling the truth.**\n\nIf Alex is truthful, then both of his statements are true:\n\n1. \"I didn't cheat.\" So, A is false.\n2. \"Casey didn't cheat either.\" So, C is false.\n\nSo, in this case, A = false, C = false.\n\nNow, let's look at Blake's statement: \"If Alex cheated, then Casey cheated too.\"\n\nBut since we've established that Alex didn't cheat (A = false), the implication \"If A, then C\" is automatically true, regardless of Casey's actions. Because in logic, an implication is only false when the antecedent is true and the consequent is false. Here, A is false, so the implication holds as true.\n\nSo, Blake's statement is true.\n\nBut wait, in this case, we assumed only Alex is telling the truth. However, if Blake is also telling the truth, then that means two people are telling the truth, which contradicts the given condition that exactly one is telling the truth. Therefore, this scenario is impossible because both Alex and Blake would be truthful, which violates the condition.\n\nSo, **Case 1** is invalid.\n\n**Case 2: Blake is telling the truth.**\n\nBlake's statement: \"If Alex cheated, then Casey cheated too.\"\n\nSo, let's assume Blake is truthful. Then, his statement must be true.\n\nLet me consider two possibilities within Blake's statement:\n\n1. Alex cheated (A = true).\n2. Alex didn't cheat (A = false).\n\n**Subcase 2a: A = true.**\n\nIf Alex cheated, then according to Blake's statement, Casey must also cheat (C = true).\n\nSo, in this subcase, A = true, C = true.\n\nNow, let's look at Alex's statement: \"I didn't cheat, and Casey didn't cheat either.\"\n\nBut we've assumed A = true, so Alex is lying. His statement is false.\n\nCasey's statement: \"I didn't cheat, but either Alex or Blake did.\"\n\nBut we've assumed C = true, so Casey is lying as well.\n\nSo, in this subcase, both Alex and Casey are lying, and Blake is telling the truth. That fits the condition where exactly one person is truthful.\n\nTherefore, this subcase is possible. So, under this scenario:\n\n- Blake is truthful.\n- Alex and Casey are lying.\n- A = true, C = true.\n\nBut wait, we need to see if this is the only possibility or if there's another subcase.\n\n**Subcase 2b: A = false.**\n\nIf Alex didn't cheat, then Blake's statement \"If A, then C\" becomes \"If false, then C.\" In logic, an implication with a false antecedent is always true. So, Blake's statement is true regardless of C.\n\nBut if Blake is telling the truth, and A = false, then we need to check Alex and Casey's statements.\n\nAlex's statement: \"I didn't cheat, and Casey didn't cheat either.\"\n\nSince A = false, Alex is truthful in saying he didn't cheat. But he also claims Casey didn't cheat. If Casey did cheat, then Alex's statement would be partially false. If Casey didn't cheat, then Alex's statement would be entirely true.\n\nCasey's statement: \"I didn't cheat, but either Alex or Blake did.\"\n\nIf Casey didn't cheat (C = false), then the first part of his statement is true. The second part, \"either Alex or Blake did,\" would need to be true. Since A = false, it must be that Blake did (B = true).\n\nSo, in this subcase:\n\n- Alex didn't cheat (A = false), so he's truthful in that part.\n- Casey didn't cheat (C = false), so his first part is true.\n- To satisfy Casey's statement, since C = false, B must be true.\n\nSo, in this subcase:\n\n- A = false, C = false, B = true.\n- Alex's statement: \"I didn't cheat, and Casey didn't cheat either.\" Since both are true, Alex is truthful.\n- Casey's statement: \"I didn't cheat, but either Alex or Blake did.\" Both parts are true because C = false and B = true.\n- Blake's statement: \"If Alex cheated, then Casey cheated too.\" Since A = false, this implication is true.\n\nBut here, both Alex and Casey are telling the truth, which contradicts the condition that only one person is truthful. Therefore, this subcase is invalid.\n\nSo, **Subcase 2b** is invalid because it leads to two truthful statements.\n\nTherefore, the only valid subcase under **Case 2** is **Subcase 2a**, where A = true, C = true.\n\nSo, in this scenario:\n\n- Blake is truthful.\n- Alex and Casey are lying.\n- A = true, C = true.\n\nBut wait, we need to check if this is the only possibility.\n\nLet me think if there's another angle.\n\nWait, in **Subcase 2a**, both Alex and Casey are lying. So, A = true (Alex cheated), and C = true (Casey cheated). But according to Alex's statement, he said both he and Casey didn't cheat, which is a lie because he did cheat. Casey said he didn't cheat but either Alex or Blake did. Since Casey did cheat, his statement is a lie because he claimed he didn't cheat. So, that checks out.\n\nBlake's statement holds because if Alex cheated, Casey does too. So, Blake is truthful.\n\nSo, this seems consistent.\n\n**Case 3: Casey is telling the truth.**\n\nCasey's statement: \"I didn't cheat, but either Alex or Blake did.\"\n\nSo, let's assume Casey is truthful.\n\nThis means two things:\n\n1. Casey didn't cheat (C = false).\n2. Either Alex cheated (A = true) or Blake cheated (B = true).\n\nNow, let's look at Alex's statement: \"I didn't cheat, and Casey didn't cheat either.\"\n\nSince we've established that C = false, the second part of Alex's statement is true. But if Alex didn't cheat (A = false), then his first part is true, making his entire statement true.\n\nSo, Alex's statement is true.\n\nBut we assumed only Casey is truthful, so Alex cannot be truthful. Therefore, this scenario is impossible because both Alex and Casey would be telling the truth, which violates the condition.\n\nTherefore, **Case 3** is invalid.\n\nWait, let me double-check that.\n\nIf Casey is truthful, then C = false, and either A or B is true.\n\nIf Alex didn't cheat (A = false), then his statement is \"I didn't cheat, and Casey didn't cheat either.\" Since both are true, Alex is telling the truth. So, both Alex and Casey would be truthful, which is not allowed because exactly one person must be truthful. Therefore, this scenario is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, if A = true, then Alex is lying because he said he didn't cheat. So, let's consider that.\n\n**Subcase 3a: A = true, B = false.**\n\nSo, Alex cheated (A = true), Blake didn't cheat (B = false).\n\nCasey is truthful (C = false), so his statement is true: C = false, and either A or B is true. Since A = true, this holds.\n\nNow, let's check Alex's statement: \"I didn't cheat, and Casey didn't cheat either.\" Since A = true, Alex is lying. So, his statement is false.\n\nBlake's statement: \"If Alex cheated, then Casey cheated too.\" Since A = true and C = false, the implication is \"If true, then false,\" which is false. So, Blake is lying.\n\nSo, in this subcase:\n\n- Casey is truthful.\n- Alex and Blake are lying.\n- A = true, B = false, C = false.\n\nThis fits the condition where exactly one person is truthful.\n\nWait, but hold on. Earlier, I thought that if A = true, then Alex's statement is a lie, which is correct, and Blake's statement is a lie because the implication is false. So, this seems possible.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm.\n\nIf A = true and C = false, then Blake's statement \"If A, then C\" is false because the antecedent is true, but the consequent is false. So, Blake is lying.\n\nAlex's statement is a lie because he said he didn't cheat. Casey's statement is true because he said he didn't cheat and either Alex or Blake did, which is true since A = true.\n\nSo, this seems to fit.\n\nBut earlier, I thought that if A = true and C = false, but Casey is truthful, then Alex's statement is a lie, and Blake's statement is a lie, which fits the condition.\n\nSo, this seems like another possible scenario.\n\nWait, so now I have two possible scenarios:\n\n1. From **Case 2**, where Blake is truthful, and both Alex and Casey are lying, with A = true and C = true.\n2. From **Case 3**, where Casey is truthful, and A = true, B = false, C = false.\n\nBut wait, in the first scenario, both Alex and Casey are lying, meaning both cheated. In the second scenario, only Alex cheated, and Blake didn't, but Casey didn't cheat either.\n\nBut the problem is that we need to determine who cheated, given that exactly one is telling the truth.\n\nBut wait, in the first scenario, Blake is truthful, and both Alex and Casey cheated. In the second scenario, Casey is truthful, and only Alex cheated.\n\nBut I need to check which one is consistent.\n\nWait, let's re-examine **Case 3**.\n\nIf Casey is truthful, then C = false, and either A or B is true.\n\nIf A = true, then Alex is lying, which is consistent.\n\nIf B = true, then Blake is lying, which would mean that the statement \"If A, then C\" is a lie, meaning that A is true and C is false. But in this case, if B = true, then Blake is lying, so his statement is false, which would mean that either A is false or C is true, or both. But since we've assumed B = true, and C = false, then for Blake's statement to be false, \"If A, then C\" must be false. Since A could be true or false.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to map it out more clearly.\n\nLet me create a table of possibilities, considering each case where one person is truthful and the others are lying.\n\n**Possibility 1: Only Alex is truthful.**\n\nAs we saw earlier, if Alex is truthful, then A = false and C = false.\n\nThen, Blake's statement: \"If A, then C.\" Since A = false, the implication is true, so Blake is also truthful. But we can't have both Alex and Blake truthful, so this is invalid.\n\n**Possibility 2: Only Blake is truthful.**\n\nBlake's statement: \"If A, then C.\"\n\nSo, if A = true, then C must be true.\n\nIf A = false, then the implication is true regardless of C.\n\nBut we need to ensure that Alex and Casey are lying.\n\nIf A = true, then:\n\n- Alex is lying, so his statement that A = false and C = false is a lie, which is consistent because A = true and C = true.\n- Casey is lying, so his statement that C = false and (A or B) = true is a lie. Since C = true, Casey is lying, so either A or B is false. But A = true, so B must be false.\n\nSo, in this scenario:\n\n- A = true\n- C = true\n- B = false\n\nBlake is truthful, Alex and Casey are lying.\n\nThis is consistent.\n\nIf A = false, then:\n\n- Alex's statement is \"I didn't cheat, and Casey didn't cheat either.\" Since A = false, Alex is truthful in the first part, but if C = false, he's truthful in the second part as well. So, Alex is truthful, which contradicts the condition that only Blake is truthful. Therefore, A cannot be false in this scenario.\n\nTherefore, the only way for Blake to be the only truthful one is if A = true, C = true, and B = false.\n\n**Possibility 3: Only Casey is truthful.**\n\nCasey's statement: \"I didn't cheat, but either Alex or Blake did.\"\n\nSo, C = false, and (A or B) = true.\n\nNow, we need Alex and Blake to be lying.\n\nAlex's statement: \"I didn't cheat, and Casey didn't cheat either.\" Since C = false, the second part is true. If A = false, the first part is true, making his entire statement true. But we can't have Alex truthful, so A must be true.\n\nSo, A = true.\n\nThen, Alex's statement is a lie because he said he didn't cheat.\n\nCasey's statement is true because C = false and A = true.\n\nNow, let's check Blake's statement: \"If A, then C.\" Since A = true and C = false, the implication is false. So, Blake is lying.\n\nTherefore, in this scenario:\n\n- A = true\n- C = false\n- B = false (since Blake is lying, but let's see)\n\nWait, actually, Blake's statement is \"If A, then C.\" Since A = true and C = false, this is a false statement, so Blake is lying.\n\nSo, in this scenario:\n\n- Casey is truthful.\n- Alex is lying (A = true).\n- Blake is lying.\n\nThis fits the condition of only one truthful person.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought this was possible, but I need to check if it's consistent.\n\nYes, because:\n\n- Casey's statement is true: C = false, and A = true.\n- Alex's statement is a lie: he claimed he didn't cheat, but he did.\n- Blake's statement is a lie: he claimed that if A, then C, but since A = true and C = false, it's a false implication.\n\nTherefore, this is a valid scenario.\n\nSo, now I have two possible scenarios:\n\n1. Blake is truthful, Alex and Casey cheated.\n2. Casey is truthful, Alex cheated, Casey and Blake didn't cheat.\n\nBut wait, in the second scenario, Casey is truthful, so C = false, and A = true, B = false.\n\nBut wait, in the second scenario, is Blake's statement consistent?\n\nBlake's statement: \"If A, then C.\" Since A = true and C = false, this is false, so Blake is lying, which is consistent.\n\nSo, both scenarios are possible. But the problem is that the question is asking \"who cheated,\" implying that there's a unique solution.\n\nHmm, this suggests that there might be ambiguity, but perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, let's go back to **Possibility 3**.\n\nIf Casey is truthful, then C = false, and (A or B) = true.\n\nIf A = true, then Alex is lying, and Blake's statement is false.\n\nIf B = true, then Alex's statement is true because Alex said he didn't cheat and Casey didn't cheat either. But if B = true, then Alex's statement would be true because he didn't cheat, and Casey didn't cheat (since C = false), but Blake did. However, if B = true, then Blake is telling the truth because his statement is \"If A, then C.\" Since A could be true or false, but if A = false, the implication is true regardless. Wait, this is getting complicated.\n\nWait, let's clarify.\n\nIn **Possibility 3**, we're assuming Casey is truthful, so C = false, and (A or B) = true.\n\nIf A = true, then Alex is lying, and Blake's statement is false.\n\nIf B = true, then Alex's statement is \"I didn't cheat, and Casey didn't cheat either.\" Since A = false, Alex is truthful in the first part, and since C = false, he's truthful in the second part. So, Alex is truthful, which contradicts the condition that only Casey is truthful. Therefore, B cannot be true in this scenario; it must be that A = true.\n\nTherefore, in **Possibility 3**, the only possibility is A = true, B = false, C = false.\n\nSo, now we have two scenarios:\n\n1. **Possibility 2:** Blake is truthful, A = true, C = true, B = false.\n2. **Possibility 3:** Casey is truthful, A = true, C = false, B = false.\n\nBut wait, in the first scenario, both Alex and Casey cheated, while in the second scenario, only Alex cheated.\n\nBut the problem is that we need to determine who cheated, given that exactly one person is telling the truth.\n\nHowever, the problem is that both scenarios satisfy the condition, but the solution may require determining who is the cheater.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering **Possibility 3**.\n\nLet me re-examine **Possibility 3**.\n\nIf Casey is truthful, then C = false, and (A or B) = true.\n\nIf A = true, then Alex is lying, so his statement that he didn't cheat is false, which is consistent.\n\nCasey's statement is true: he didn't cheat, but either Alex or Blake did.\n\nBlake's statement: \"If A, then C.\" Since A = true and C = false, the implication is false, so Blake is lying.\n\nTherefore, in this scenario:\n\n- Casey is truthful.\n- Alex is lying (A = true).\n- Blake is lying.\n\nThis is valid.\n\nIn **Possibility 2**, where Blake is truthful:\n\n- Blake's statement is true: If A, then C.\n- So, if A = true, C must be true.\n- Alex is lying: he said he didn't cheat and Casey didn't cheat, but he did cheat, so both are lies.\n- Casey is lying: he said he didn't cheat"

    "solution": "Solve this problem step by step. End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: Three friends, Alex, Blake, and Casey, are suspected of cheating on an exam. During investigation, they made the following statements:\n\nAlex: 'I didn't cheat, and Casey didn't cheat either.'\nBlake: 'If Alex cheated, then Casey cheated too.'\nCasey: 'I didn't cheat, but either Alex or Blake did.'\n\nIf exactly one of them is telling the truth, who cheated on the exam? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I've got this logic puzzle to solve, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and make sure I understand what's going on.\n\nThere are three friends: Alex, Blake, and Casey. They're all suspected of cheating on an exam. Each of them made a statement during the investigation. The key thing here is that exactly one of them is telling the truth, and the other two are lying. My goal is to determine who cheated based on their statements.\n\nLet me list out their statements first:\n\n- **Alex**: \"I didn't cheat, and Casey didn't cheat either.\"\n- **Blake**: \"If Alex cheated, then Casey cheated too.\"\n- **Casey**: \"I didn't cheat, but either Alex or Blake did.\"\n\nSo, we have three statements, and only one of them is true. The other two must be false. I need to analyze each possibility to see which one fits.\n\nFirst, I'll consider each person as the one telling the truth and see if the other two can be lying consistently.\n\n**Case 1: Suppose Alex is telling the truth.**\nIf Alex is truthful, then both parts of his statement must be true:\n1. Alex didn't cheat.\n2. Casey didn't cheat.\n\nSo, if Alex is truthful, both Alex and Casey are innocent. That leaves Blake as the potential cheater.\n\nNow, let's see what Blake's statement would imply. Blake says, \"If Alex cheated, then Casey cheated too.\" But since we're assuming Alex didn't cheat, the conditional statement \"If Alex cheated...\" is automatically false. In logic, a conditional statement is only false when the antecedent (the \"if\" part) is true, and the consequent (the \"then\" part) is false. So, since Alex didn't cheat, Blake's statement is technically true because the condition is false. Wait, that's a problem because we already assumed only one person is telling the truth, which would mean Blake's statement can't be true if Alex is truthful.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. If Alex didn't cheat, then Blake's statement is a conditional that doesn't hold because the antecedent is false. In logic, a conditional statement like \"If P, then Q\" is considered true when P is false, regardless of Q. So, Blake's statement would actually be true if Alex didn't cheat, which contradicts our initial assumption that only Alex is telling the truth. Therefore, this scenario is impossible because it would require both Alex and Blake to be telling the truth, which violates the condition that only one is truthful.\n\nSo, **Case 1 is invalid** because it leads to two truths.\n\n**Case 2: Suppose Blake is telling the truth.**\nIf Blake is truthful, then his statement \"If Alex cheated, then Casey cheated too\" must be true.\n\nNow, since only one person is telling the truth, both Alex and Casey must be lying.\n\nLet's analyze Alex's lie. Alex says, \"I didn't cheat, and Casey didn't cheat either.\" If Alex is lying, then at least one part of his statement is false. Since we're assuming Alex is lying, either he cheated, or Casey cheated, or both. But we also know that only one person is telling the truth, so Casey is lying. Let's see what Casey's lie implies.\n\nCasey says, \"I didn't cheat, but either Alex or Blake did.\" Since Casey is lying, the opposite must be true. The negation of \"I didn't cheat\" is \"I cheated,\" and the negation of \"either Alex or Blake did\" is \"neither Alex nor Blake did.\" So, Casey must have cheated, and neither Alex nor Blake did.\n\nWait, but if Casey is lying, and he says \"I didn't cheat,\" that would mean he cheated. And he also says \"either Alex or Blake did,\" which is a lie, so the opposite is that neither did. So, Casey cheated, and neither Alex nor Blake cheated.\n\nBut hold on, if Casey cheated, then Blake's statement, \"If Alex cheated, then Casey cheated too,\" is true because Casey did cheat. But we're in the scenario where only Blake is telling the truth. So, that's a problem because if Blake is truthful, then his statement holds, but Casey is also a cheater, and Alex is innocent. But let's check if this holds.\n\nIf Blake is truthful, then:\n- If Alex cheated, Casey would cheat too.\nBut in this scenario, Alex didn't cheat, as Alex is innocent. So, Blake's statement doesn't impose any condition on Casey because the antecedent is false. Therefore, Blake's statement is true regardless.\n\nNow, Casey is lying, so he cheated, and neither Alex nor Blake cheated. So, only Casey cheated.\n\nBut wait, if only Casey cheated, and Alex and Blake are innocent, then Alex's statement that \"I didn't cheat and Casey didn't cheat either\" would actually be true because both Alex and Casey didn't cheat. But we're in the case where only Blake is truthful, so Alex's statement can't be true. This creates a contradiction because if Casey cheated, then Alex's statement would be true, which violates the condition that only Blake is truthful.\n\nTherefore, **Case 2 is invalid** because it leads to two truths: Blake and Alex.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Let me re-examine.\n\nIf Blake is truthful, then his statement is true. Casey is lying, so Casey cheated, and neither Alex nor Blake did. So, Casey is the only cheater. But then Alex's statement is \"I didn't cheat, and Casey didn't cheat either,\" which is true because Alex didn't cheat and Casey did cheat? Wait, no. Alex says Casey didn't cheat. But Casey did cheat, so Alex's statement is false because he claims Casey didn't cheat. Wait, no, hold on.\n\nWait, no, Alex says, \"I didn't cheat, and Casey didn't cheat either.\" If Casey did cheat, then the second part of Alex's statement is false. So, Alex's statement is \"I didn't cheat AND Casey didn't cheat.\" Since Casey did cheat, the second part is false, making the entire statement false. So, Alex is lying, which is consistent because we're assuming only Blake is truthful.\n\nBut then, if Casey did cheat, and Alex is lying, then Alex's statement is false. So, either he cheated, or Casey did, or both. Since we know Casey did, that's fine.\n\nSo, in this case, Blake is truthful, Casey is lying, and Alex is lying. But wait, does this hold?\n\nWait, let me map it out:\n\n- Blake is truthful: \"If Alex cheated, then Casey cheats too.\" Since Alex didn't cheat, the statement is vacuously true.\n- Casey is lying: \"I didn't cheat, but either Alex or Blake did.\" So, Casey did cheat, and neither Alex nor Blake did.\n- Alex is lying: \"I didn't cheat, and Casey didn't cheat.\" So, either he cheated, or Casey did, or both. Since Casey did, that's fine.\n\nBut in this scenario, only Casey cheated. So, that would mean Alex is innocent, and Casey is guilty, and Blake is innocent. But then, Alex's statement is \"I didn't cheat, and Casey didn't cheat either.\" Since Casey did cheat, Alex's statement is false, which is consistent.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought that if Casey is lying, then he cheated, and neither Alex nor Blake did. So, only Casey cheated. But let me check if this is possible.\n\nIf only Casey cheated, then:\n\n- Alex: innocent\n- Blake: innocent\n- Casey: guilty\n\nNow, let's verify each statement:\n\n- Alex: \"I didn't cheat, and Casey didn't cheat either.\" \u2192 False (because Casey did cheat)\n- Blake: \"If Alex cheated, then Casey cheats too.\" \u2192 True (since Alex didn't cheat, the statement is vacuously true)\n- Casey: \"I didn't cheat, but either Alex or Blake did.\" \u2192 False (because Casey did cheat, and neither Alex nor Blake did)\n\nSo, in this scenario, only Blake is telling the truth, which fits the condition that exactly one is truthful.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought there was a contradiction, but now it seems to fit. So, perhaps Case 2 is possible.\n\nBut let me check another angle. If only Casey cheated, then:\n\n- Alex is innocent, so his statement is false.\n- Blake's statement is true because the condition is false.\n- Casey's statement is false.\n\nSo, only Blake is truthful. That works.\n\nBut wait, I thought earlier that if Casey is lying, then he cheated, and neither Alex nor Blake did. So, only Casey cheated. That seems consistent.\n\nSo, perhaps **Case 2 is possible**, with only Blake telling the truth, and Casey cheating.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If only Casey cheated, then Alex's statement is false, which is fine. Blake's statement is true, and Casey's statement is false. So, only Blake is truthful, which matches the condition.\n\nSo, that seems okay. But let's check the next case to be thorough.\n\n**Case 3: Suppose Casey is telling the truth.**\nIf Casey is truthful, then his statement is true: \"I didn't cheat, but either Alex or Blake did.\"\n\nSince only one person is truthful, both Alex and Blake must be lying.\n\nLet's analyze Alex's lie. Alex says, \"I didn't cheat, and Casey didn't cheat either.\" If Alex is lying, then either he cheated, or Casey did, or both. But we're assuming Casey is innocent because Casey is truthful in this scenario, so Casey didn't cheat. Therefore, for Alex's statement to be false, Alex must have cheated.\n\nSo, Alex cheated.\n\nNow, let's look at Blake's statement. Blake says, \"If Alex cheated, then Casey cheats too.\" Since Alex did cheat, the antecedent is true. Therefore, for the statement to be false (since Blake is lying), the consequent must be false. So, Casey must not have cheated.\n\nBut wait, in this scenario, Casey is truthful, so Casey didn't cheat. Therefore, Blake's statement is false because the antecedent is true, and the consequent is false (Casey didn't cheat). So, Blake's statement is false, which is consistent because he's supposed to be lying.\n\nSo, let's map this out:\n\n- Casey is truthful: \"I didn't cheat, but either Alex or Blake did.\" So, Casey is innocent, and at least one of Alex or Blake cheated.\n- Alex is lying: \"I didn't cheat, and Casey didn't cheat.\" Since Casey is innocent, the second part is true, but the first part is false. Therefore, Alex cheated.\n- Blake is lying: \"If Alex cheated, then Casey cheats too.\" Since Alex did cheat, and Casey didn't, Blake's statement is false.\n\nSo, in this scenario, Alex cheated, Casey is innocent, and Blake is lying.\n\nBut wait, Casey's statement is \"I didn't cheat, but either Alex or Blake did.\" Since Casey is truthful, he didn't cheat, and at least one of Alex or Blake did. Since Alex did, that's satisfied.\n\nSo, this scenario works: only Casey is truthful, Alex cheated, and Blake is lying.\n\nBut wait, earlier in Case 2, we had only Blake truthful, and Casey cheated. Now, in Case 3, we have only Casey truthful, and Alex cheated.\n\nSo, both scenarios are possible? That can't be, because the problem states that exactly one is telling the truth, so only one scenario should fit.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake in Case 2.\n\nLet me re-examine Case 2.\n\n**Re-examining Case 2: Blake is truthful.**\n- Blake's statement: \"If Alex cheated, then Casey cheats too.\" Since Alex didn't cheat, the statement is true.\n- Casey is lying: \"I didn't cheat, but either Alex or Blake did.\" So, Casey cheated, and neither Alex nor Blake did.\n- Alex is lying: \"I didn't cheat, and Casey didn't cheat.\" Since Casey did cheat, Alex's statement is false.\n\nSo, in this case, only Blake is truthful, and Casey cheated, with Alex innocent.\n\nBut wait, in this scenario, Casey is lying, so he cheated, and neither Alex nor Blake did. So, only Casey cheated.\n\nBut in this case, Casey's statement is \"I didn't cheat, but either Alex or Blake did.\" Since he cheated, the first part is a lie, and the second part is a lie because neither Alex nor Blake did. So, his entire statement is a lie, which is consistent.\n\nSo, in this scenario, only Casey cheated, and Blake is truthful.\n\nBut wait, earlier in Case 3, only Alex cheated, and Casey is truthful.\n\nSo, which one is it? How can both scenarios be possible?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me try to see which scenario is consistent.\n\nIn Case 2:\n\n- Only Blake is truthful.\n- Casey cheated.\n- Alex innocent.\n\nIn Case 3:\n\n- Only Casey is truthful.\n- Alex cheated.\n- Blake innocent.\n\nBut the problem states that exactly one person is telling the truth. So, both scenarios fit, but the answer depends on which one is possible.\n\nWait, but the problem states that exactly one of them is telling the truth, so both scenarios are possible? That can't be, because the answer should be unique.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in one of the cases.\n\nLet me check again.\n\nIn Case 3:\n\n- Casey is truthful: \"I didn't cheat, but either Alex or Blake did.\"\n- So, Casey is innocent, and at least one of Alex or Blake did.\n- Alex is lying: \"I didn't cheat, and Casey didn't cheat.\" Since Casey is innocent, the second part is true, but the first part is false. So, Alex cheated.\n- Blake is lying: \"If Alex cheated, then Casey cheats too.\" Since Alex did cheat, and Casey didn't, Blake's statement is false.\n\nSo, this is consistent: Alex cheated, Casey innocent, Blake innocent.\n\nIn Case 2:\n\n- Blake is truthful: \"If Alex cheated, then Casey cheats too.\" Since Alex didn't cheat, the statement is true.\n- Casey is lying: \"I didn't cheat, but either Alex or Blake did.\" So, Casey cheated, and neither Alex nor Blake did.\n- Alex is lying: \"I didn't cheat, and Casey didn't cheat.\" Since Casey did cheat, Alex's statement is false.\n\nSo, this is also consistent: Casey cheated, Alex and Blake innocent.\n\nWait, but the problem says that exactly one of them is telling the truth, so both scenarios are possible? That can't be right because the answer should be unique.\n\nWait, but maybe only one of these scenarios is possible because the other leads to a contradiction.\n\nWait, let me think about Case 3 again.\n\nIn Case 3:\n\n- Casey is truthful, so he didn't cheat.\n- His statement says that either Alex or Blake did.\n- Alex is lying, so he did cheat.\n- Blake is lying, so his statement is false.\n\nBut if Alex cheated, then Blake's statement \"If Alex cheated, then Casey cheats too\" would be true because Alex did cheat and Casey did cheat. But in this scenario, Casey didn't cheat, so Blake's statement is false, which is consistent because Blake is lying.\n\nWait, no, if Alex cheated, then Blake's statement would be true only if Casey also cheated. But since Casey didn't cheat, Blake's statement is false, which is consistent because Blake is lying.\n\nSo, in Case 3, it's consistent.\n\nSimilarly, in Case 2, Blake's statement is true because the antecedent is false (Alex didn't cheat), so the statement is vacuously true.\n\nSo, both scenarios are possible. But the problem states that exactly one of them is telling the truth, so perhaps both are possible, but we need to see which one is consistent.\n\nWait, but in Case 3, Casey is truthful, so his statement is true. But in that case, Alex cheated, and Blake is innocent. So, only Casey and Alex are lying? Wait, no, Blake is lying as well.\n\nWait, no, in Case 3, only Casey is truthful. So, Alex and Blake are lying.\n\nSimilarly, in Case 2, only Blake is truthful, so Alex and Casey are lying.\n\nBut both scenarios are possible because in each case, exactly one person is telling the truth, and the others are lying.\n\nBut the problem probably expects one answer, so perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me try to see which scenario is more consistent.\n\nIf in Case 3, Alex cheated, and Casey is innocent, then Casey's statement is \"I didn't cheat, but either Alex or Blake did.\" Since Casey is innocent, the first part is true, and the second part is true because Alex did cheat. So, Casey's statement is true.\n\nWait, but in Case 3, we assumed Casey is truthful, so his statement is true. But in this scenario, Casey's statement is true because he didn't cheat, and Alex did. So, that's consistent.\n\nBut wait, in Case 3, Casey is truthful, so his statement is true, and Alex is lying, so his statement is false.\n\nSimilarly, in Case 2, Blake is truthful, Casey is lying, and Alex is lying.\n\nSo, both scenarios are possible, but perhaps only one of them is possible because the other leads to a contradiction.\n\nWait, let me think again.\n\nIn Case 2:\n\n- Blake is truthful: \"If Alex cheated, then Casey cheats too.\" Since Alex didn't cheat, the statement is true.\n- Casey is lying: \"I didn't cheat, but either Alex or Blake did.\" So, Casey cheated, and neither Alex nor Blake did.\n- Alex is lying: \"I didn't cheat, and Casey didn't cheat.\" Since Casey did cheat, Alex's statement is false.\n\nSo, in this scenario, only Casey cheated, and Alex and Blake are innocent.\n\nIn Case 3:\n\n- Casey is truthful: \"I didn't cheat, but either Alex or Blake did.\" So, Casey is innocent, and at least one of Alex or Blake did.\n- Alex is lying: \"I didn't cheat, and Casey didn't cheat.\" Since Casey is innocent, the second part is true, but the first part is false, so Alex cheated.\n- Blake is lying: \"If Alex cheated, then Casey cheats too.\" Since Alex did cheat, and Casey didn't, Blake's statement is false.\n\nSo, in this scenario, Alex cheated, Casey is innocent, and Blake is innocent.\n\nTherefore, both scenarios are possible: either Casey cheated (Case 2) or Alex cheated (Case 3).\n\nBut the problem states that exactly one of them is telling the truth, so both scenarios fit, but the answer depends on which one is intended.\n\nWait, but perhaps only one of these scenarios is possible because the other leads to a contradiction.\n\nWait, in Case 3, if Alex cheated, then Blake's statement is \"If Alex cheated, then Casey cheats too.\" Since Alex did cheat, and Casey didn't, Blake's statement is false, which is consistent because Blake is lying.\n\nIn Case 2, if only Casey cheated, then Blake's statement is vacuously true because"

    "solution": "Solve this problem step by step. End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: Three friends, Alex, Blake, and Casey, are suspected of cheating on an exam. During investigation, they made the following statements:\n\nAlex: 'I didn't cheat, and Casey didn't cheat either.'\nBlake: 'If Alex cheated, then Casey cheated too.'\nCasey: 'I didn't cheat, but either Alex or Blake did.'\n\nIf exactly one of them is telling the truth, who cheated on the exam? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this logic problem here with three friends: Alex, Blake, and Casey. They're all suspected of cheating on an exam. Each of them made a statement, and I need to figure out who cheated, given that exactly one of them is telling the truth. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll list out each person's statement to have a clear view:\n\n- **Alex:** \"I didn't cheat, and Casey didn't cheat either.\"\n- **Blake:** \"If Alex cheated, then Casey cheated too.\"\n- **Casey:** \"I didn't cheat, but either Alex or Blake did.\"\n\nOkay, so each of them is making a statement about their own cheating and possibly others. Now, the key point is that exactly one of them is telling the truth. That means two are lying, and one is truthful. My goal is to figure out who is lying, who is truthful, and consequently, who cheated.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is by considering each possibility of who could be telling the truth and then analyzing the implications. Since there are three people, I can consider each one as the potential truth-teller and see if their statements hold under that assumption.\n\nLet's start with **Alex**. Suppose Alex is telling the truth. If Alex is truthful, then according to his statement, he didn't cheat, and Casey also didn't cheat. So, Alex is innocent, and Casey is innocent. Now, if both Alex and Casey are innocent, what does that mean for Blake? Well, Blake's statement is: \"If Alex cheats, then Casey cheats too.\" But if Alex is innocent, the condition \"If Alex cheats\" is false, so the entire statement becomes \"False or Casey cheats.\" In logic, an implication is only false if the antecedent is true and the consequent is false. Here, since the antecedent is false, the entire implication is true regardless of the consequent. So, Blake's statement is true.\n\nWait a minute, but we were supposed to have only one person telling the truth. If Alex is telling the truth, then Blake's statement is also true, which would mean two people are telling the truth. That contradicts the condition that exactly one is telling the truth. Therefore, Alex cannot be the one telling the truth. So, Alex is lying.\n\nAlright, so Alex is lying. Now, moving on to **Blake**. Suppose Blake is telling the truth. If Blake is truthful, then his statement \"If Alex cheats, then Casey cheats too\" is true. Now, let's parse this statement. In logic, \"If P, then Q\" is only false when P is true and Q is false. So, for Blake's statement to be true, either Alex is innocent, or if Alex is guilty, then Casey must also be guilty.\n\nBut since we already determined that Alex is lying, which means Alex is guilty, right? Because if Alex is lying, then his statement \"I didn't cheat, and Casey didn't cheat either\" is false. So, either he cheated, or Casey cheated, or both. Since we're assuming Blake is truthful, and Blake's statement is \"If Alex cheats, then Casey cheats too,\" and we've established that Alex is guilty, the implication requires that Casey is also guilty.\n\nTherefore, if Blake is telling the truth, then both Alex and Casey are guilty, and only Blake is innocent. Now, let's check Casey's statement under this assumption. Casey says, \"I didn't cheat, but either Alex or Blake did.\" If Casey is lying, as per our assumption that only Blake is truthful, then Casey's statement must be false. Let's see: Casey claims he didn't cheat, which would be a lie because we've concluded he is guilty, and he also claims that either Alex or Blake did cheat. But since both Alex and Blake are guilty, this part is true. However, since Casey is lying overall, the entire statement must be false. However, in logic, a statement like \"A and B\" is false if either A is false or B is false. Here, \"I didn't cheat\" is false (because he did cheat), making the entire statement false. So, Casey's statement is indeed false, which aligns with our assumption that only Blake is telling the truth.\n\nSo, under this scenario, Blake is truthful, Alex and Casey are lying, meaning both Alex and Casey cheated. But wait, the problem states that exactly one of them is telling the truth. So, is this scenario acceptable? Let me double-check.\n\nIf Blake is truthful, then Alex and Casey are lying. That means:\n\n- Alex is lying: So, either he cheated, or Casey cheated, or both.\n- Casey is lying: So, either he cheated, or \"either Alex or Blake did\" is false.\n\nBut we've already established that Alex is guilty, so Alex cheated. Now, Casey is guilty as well because of Blake's truthful statement. So, both Alex and Casey cheated, and Blake is innocent.\n\nBut the problem says exactly one of them is telling the truth, so only Blake is truthful, and the other two are lying. That fits because only Blake is truthful, and the rest are lying.\n\nWait, but let me check another angle. Let's consider if Casey is the one telling the truth.\n\nSuppose Casey is telling the truth. Then, according to his statement: \"I didn't cheat, but either Alex or Blake did.\" So, Casey is innocent, and at least one of Alex or Blake cheated.\n\nNow, if Casey is truthful, then his statement is true. So, he didn't cheat, and either Alex or Blake did. Now, let's see what this implies for the others.\n\nIf Casey is truthful, then we know he didn't cheat. Now, let's look at Alex's statement: \"I didn't cheat, and Casey didn't cheat either.\" If Alex is lying, then his statement is false. Since Casey didn't cheat, the second part of Alex's statement is true. Therefore, for the entire statement to be false, the first part must be false. So, Alex must have cheated.\n\nSo, if Alex is lying, he cheated, and Casey didn't cheat. Now, what about Blake's statement? Blake says, \"If Alex cheats, then Casey cheats too.\" If Alex cheats, which he does, then according to Blake's statement, Casey must also cheat. But we've already established that Casey didn't cheat because Casey is telling the truth. Therefore, Blake's statement is false because the antecedent is true (Alex cheated), and the consequent is false (Casey didn't cheat). Therefore, Blake is lying.\n\nSo, under this scenario, Casey is truthful, Alex is lying, and Blake is lying. That means only Casey is truthful, which fits the condition that exactly one person is telling the truth. In this case, Alex and Blake cheated, and Casey is innocent.\n\nBut wait, earlier when I considered Blake as the truthful one, I concluded that both Alex and Casey cheated. Now, considering Casey as the truthful one, I have Alex cheating and Casey innocent, with Blake also cheating. So, who is cheating in each scenario?\n\nIn the first scenario (Blake truthful): Alex and Casey cheat.\n\nIn the second scenario (Casey truthful): Alex and Blake cheat.\n\nBut the problem is that exactly one person is telling the truth, so both scenarios are possible? But that can't be, because the problem must have a unique solution. So, I must have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nLet me go back to the first scenario where I assumed Blake is truthful. So, if Blake is truthful, then his statement \"If Alex cheats, then Casey cheats too\" is true. Since we determined Alex is lying, he cheated. Therefore, Casey must also cheat. So, Alex and Casey cheat, Blake is innocent.\n\nBut then, let's check Casey's statement. Casey says, \"I didn't cheat, but either Alex or Blake did.\" If Casey is lying, then either he cheated, or the part about \"either Alex or Blake did\" is false. Since we've established that Casey is guilty, his statement is false because he did cheat. So, his entire statement is false, which is consistent with him lying.\n\nBut in this scenario, both Alex and Casey cheat, and Blake is innocent. So, two people cheated, but only Blake is truthful. That's acceptable because the problem states that exactly one is telling the truth, regardless of how many cheated.\n\nNow, in the second scenario, if Casey is truthful, then he didn't cheat, and either Alex or Blake did. We determined that Alex cheated, so Blake must be innocent because Casey says \"either Alex or Blake did,\" and if Blake is innocent, then Alex did it. But wait, if Casey is truthful, and he says \"either Alex or Blake did,\" and Alex did, then Blake could be innocent. However, Blake's statement is \"If Alex cheats, then Casey cheats too.\" Since Alex cheated, but Casey didn't, Blake's statement is false, which is consistent because Blake is lying.\n\nSo, in this scenario, Alex cheated, and Blake is innocent. Casey is truthful and innocent.\n\nBut wait, this leads to two different conclusions:\n\n1. If Blake is truthful: Alex and Casey cheat.\n2. If Casey is truthful: Alex cheats, Casey and Blake are innocent.\n\nBut the problem states that exactly one is telling the truth, so both scenarios are possible? That can't be. There must be a unique solution.\n\nI think I need to re-examine the statements more carefully.\n\nLet's consider the first scenario again where Blake is truthful:\n\n- Blake: True\n- Alex: Lying\n- Casey: Lying\n\nSo, Alex is lying, meaning his statement \"I didn't cheat, and Casey didn't cheat either\" is false. Therefore, either he cheated, or Casey cheated, or both. Since Alex is lying, he's guilty, and since Blake is truthful, Casey must also be guilty.\n\nCasey, being guilty, is lying. His statement is \"I didn't cheat, but either Alex or Blake did.\" Since he's lying, the entire statement is false. So, either he cheated (which he did), or the part about \"either Alex or Blake did\" is false. But since Alex did cheat, the part about Alex is true, so the only way for the statement to be false is if Casey cheated, which he did. So, it's consistent.\n\nIn this scenario, Alex and Casey cheat, Blake is innocent.\n\nNow, the second scenario where Casey is truthful:\n\n- Casey: True\n- Alex: Lying\n- Blake: Lying\n\nCasey says he didn't cheat and that either Alex or Blake did. So, he didn't cheat, and at least one of Alex or Blake did. Since Casey is truthful, he's innocent. Now, Alex is lying, so his statement \"I didn't cheat, and Casey didn't cheat either\" is false. Since Casey didn't cheat, the second part is true, so the first part must be false. Therefore, Alex cheated.\n\nNow, Blake is lying, so his statement \"If Alex cheats, then Casey cheats too\" is false. Since Alex cheated, the antecedent is true, so for the implication to be false, the consequent must be false. Therefore, Casey didn't cheat. But we've already established that Casey is innocent, so this is consistent.\n\nSo, in this scenario, Alex cheated, Casey is innocent, and Blake is innocent. So, only Alex cheated.\n\nWait, but in this scenario, only Alex is cheating, and both Casey and Blake are innocent. But Casey is telling the truth, so that's acceptable.\n\nBut the problem is that the two scenarios lead to different conclusions: in one, two people cheat, and in the other, only one person cheats.\n\nBut the problem states that exactly one of them is telling the truth. So, both scenarios satisfy that condition, but they result in different cheating conclusions.\n\nI must have made a mistake in my analysis. Let me try another approach.\n\nPerhaps I should construct a table of possibilities.\n\nLet me define:\n\n- A: Alex cheated\n- B: Blake cheated\n- C: Casey cheated\n\nEach of them can be either guilty or innocent. Since exactly one is telling the truth, two are lying.\n\nLet's consider all possible combinations where exactly one is truthful.\n\nThere are three cases:\n\n1. Alex is truthful, others are lying.\n2. Blake is truthful, others are lying.\n3. Casey is truthful, others are lying.\n\nLet's evaluate each case.\n\n**Case 1: Alex is truthful, others are lying.**\n\nAlex's statement: \u00acA \u2227 \u00acC (Alex didn't cheat and Casey didn't cheat)\nBlake's statement: If A then C\nCasey's statement: \u00acC \u2227 (A \u2228 B) (Casey didn't cheat and either Alex or Blake did)\n\nSince Alex is truthful, A is false, C is false.\n\nTherefore:\n\nA = False\nC = False\n\nNow, let's see Blake's statement. Since A is false, \"If A then C\" is true (as the implication is true when the antecedent is false). So, Blake's statement is true, which contradicts the assumption that only Alex is truthful. Therefore, Case 1 is impossible.\n\n**Case 2: Blake is truthful, others are lying.**\n\nBlake's statement: If A then C\nAlex's statement: \u00acA \u2227 \u00acC\nCasey's statement: \u00acC \u2227 (A \u2228 B)\n\nAssume Blake is truthful, so A \u21d2 C.\n\nSince exactly one is truthful, Alex and Casey are lying.\n\nAlex's statement is \u00acA \u2227 \u00acC. Since Alex is lying, \u00ac(\u00acA \u2227 \u00acC) is true. This means A \u2228 C is true.\n\nCasey's statement is \u00acC \u2227 (A \u2228 B). Since Casey is lying, \u00ac(\u00acC \u2227 (A \u2228 B)) is true. This means C \u2228 \u00ac(A \u2228 B) is true. Which simplifies to C \u2228 (\u00acA \u2227 \u00acB) is true.\n\nBut we know from Blake's truthful statement that A \u21d2 C. So, if A is true, then C is true. Since we're assuming A \u21d2 C, and we have A \u2228 C is true from Alex's lie.\n\nBut let's consider two subcases:\n\nSubcase 2a: A is true.\n\nThen, from A \u21d2 C, C is true.\n\nSo, A = True, C = True.\n\nFrom Alex's lie: A \u2228 C = True, which is consistent.\n\nFrom Casey's lie: C \u2228 (\u00acA \u2227 \u00acB) is True. Since C is True, this is already True, regardless of B. So, Casey's lie doesn't give us new information.\n\nBut we need to check if this is consistent.\n\nSo, A = True, C = True.\n\nNow, what about B?\n\nCasey's lie: C \u2228 (\u00acA \u2227 \u00acB) is True. Since C is True, this is True regardless.\n\nBlake's statement: A \u21d2 C is True because A is True and C is True.\n\nSo, in this subcase, A and C are true, and B is... Well, we don't know yet. But we need to see if this is possible.\n\nWait, but the problem is that exactly one is telling the truth. So, if A is True, then Alex's statement is \u00acA \u2227 \u00acC, which is False, so Alex is lying. Blake is truthful, Casey is lying. So, only Blake is truthful, which is acceptable.\n\nBut in this scenario, A and C are true, so both Alex and Casey cheated. Blake is innocent.\n\nIs this possible? Yes. So, this is one possible solution: Alex and Casey cheated, Blake is innocent.\n\nSubcase 2b: A is false.\n\nFrom A \u21d2 C, if A is false, then C can be either true or false, but the implication is still true.\n\nSo, A = False.\n\nFrom Alex's lie: A \u2228 C is True. Since A is False, C must be True.\n\nSo, C = True.\n\nFrom Casey's lie: C \u2228 (\u00acA \u2227 \u00acB) is True. Since C is True, this is True regardless of B.\n\nSo, in this subcase, A = False, C = True.\n\nNow, what about B?\n\nBlake's statement is A \u21d2 C, which is True because A is False.\n\nAlex's statement is \u00acA \u2227 \u00acC, which is False because C is True.\n\nCasey's statement is \u00acC \u2227 (A \u2228 B). Since C is True, \u00acC is False, so the entire statement is False, which is consistent because Casey is lying.\n\nSo, in this scenario, A = False, C = True. So, Alex is innocent, Casey is guilty, and Blake is innocent.\n\nWait, but then who is lying?\n\nAlex is lying because his statement is \u00acA \u2227 \u00acC = \u00acFalse \u2227 \u00acTrue = True \u2227 False = False, so he's lying.\n\nBlake is truthful.\n\nCasey is lying.\n\nSo, only Blake is truthful, which fits the condition.\n\nBut in this scenario, only Casey is cheating, and Alex and Blake are innocent.\n\nSo, we have two possibilities under Case 2:\n\n- Subcase 2a: Alex and Casey cheat, Blake is innocent.\n- Subcase 2b: Casey cheats, Alex and Blake are innocent.\n\nBut wait, the problem states that exactly one is telling the truth, so both subcases satisfy that condition. However, the problem asks who cheated, and it seems like there could be two different answers based on these subcases.\n\nBut that can't be right. There must be a unique solution.\n\nI think the issue is that in Subcase 2a, both Alex and Casey cheat, but in Subcase 2b, only Casey cheats. So, which one is it?\n\nLet me check the statements again.\n\nIn Subcase 2a: A = True, C = True.\n\nCasey's statement: \u00acC \u2227 (A \u2228 B) = False \u2227 (True \u2228 B) = False. So, Casey is lying.\n\nBut in Subcase 2a, both Alex and Casey cheat, so B is innocent.\n\nIn Subcase 2b: A = False, C = True.\n\nCasey's statement: \u00acC \u2227 (A \u2228 B) = False \u2227 (False \u2228 B) = False \u2227 B.\n\nIf B is True, then Casey's statement is False \u2227 True = False.\n\nIf B is False, then Casey's statement is False \u2227 False = False.\n\nSo, in both cases, Casey is lying, which is consistent.\n\nBut the problem is that the solution is not unique based on this analysis. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my approach.\n\nPerhaps I should consider that in Case 2, when A is False, C is True, but then Casey's statement is \u00acC \u2227 (A \u2228 B) = False \u2227 (False \u2228 B) = False. So, regardless of B, Casey is lying.\n\nBut we also have Blake's statement: A \u21d2 C. Since A is False, this is True regardless of C.\n\nSo, in this scenario, only Blake is truthful, and the others are lying, which is acceptable.\n\nHowever, the problem is that the cheating could be either only Casey or both Alex and Casey.\n\nBut the problem must have a unique solution. So, perhaps I need to look at Casey's statement more carefully.\n\nCasey says, \"I didn't cheat, but either Alex or Blake did.\"\n\nIf Casey is lying, then either he cheated, or the part about \"either Alex or Blake did\" is false.\n\nBut if Casey is lying, then either:\n\n- He cheated (C"

    "solution": "Solve this problem step by step. End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: Three friends, Alex, Blake, and Casey, are suspected of cheating on an exam. During investigation, they made the following statements:\n\nAlex: 'I didn't cheat, and Casey didn't cheat either.'\nBlake: 'If Alex cheated, then Casey cheated too.'\nCasey: 'I didn't cheat, but either Alex or Blake did.'\n\nIf exactly one of them is telling the truth, who cheated on the exam? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out who cheated on the exam among Alex, Blake, and Casey. We have their statements, and we know that exactly one of them is telling the truth. Hmm, okay, let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's list out their statements:\n\n1. **Alex**: \"I didn't cheat, and Casey didn't cheat either.\"\n2. **Blake**: \"If Alex cheated, then Casey cheated too.\"\n3. **Casey**: \"I didn't cheat, but either Alex or Blake did.\"\n\nNow, since exactly one of them is telling the truth, we need to consider each possibility where only one person is truthful and see if it holds up.\n\nLet's start by assuming **Alex** is telling the truth. If Alex is truthful, then both Alex and Casey didn't cheat. So, Alex didn't cheat, and Casey didn't cheat. If that's the case, then Alex's statement is true. Now, what about Blake's statement? Blake says, \"If Alex cheats, then Casey cheats too.\" But since Alex didn't cheat, the condition in Blake's statement isn't met, so Blake's statement doesn't necessarily hold. But wait, if Alex is truthful, then Casey also didn't cheat, which makes Blake's statement irrelevant because the antecedent (Alex cheating) is false. So, Blake could be lying or telling the truth, but since only one person is telling the truth, Blake's statement must be false. However, if Alex is truthful, Casey didn't cheat, so Blake's statement would actually be true because the implication holds when the antecedent is false. But this contradicts our initial assumption that only Alex is truthful. Therefore, Alex can't be the only one telling the truth because Blake's statement would also be true, which means more than one person is telling the truth. So, Alex isn't the one who is truthful.\n\nAlright, moving on to assuming **Blake** is the one telling the truth. If Blake is truthful, then his statement \"If Alex cheats, then Casey cheats too\" must be true. Now, since exactly one person is telling the truth, both Alex and Casey must be lying. Let's see what that implies.\n\nIf Alex is lying, then either Alex cheated or Casey cheated. But Blake is truthful, so if Alex cheated, Casey must also cheat. However, Casey is lying, so Casey's statement \"I didn't cheat, but either Alex or Blake did\" must be false. Let's break that down. Casey says two things: she didn't cheat, and either Alex or Blake did. Since Casey is lying, at least one of these must be false. If she didn't cheat is false, then she did cheat. Alternatively, if she did cheat is false, then either she didn't cheat, which we've already considered, or the other part is false. Wait, this is getting a bit tangled.\n\nLet me think again. If Blake is truthful, then Alex's statement is false. So, either Alex cheated or Casey cheated (since Alex says neither cheated). Since Alex's statement is false, at least one of them cheated. Now, Casey's statement is also false. Casey says she didn't cheat, but either Alex or Blake did. Since Casey is lying, it must be that she did cheat, and either Alex or Blake didn't do it. But Blake is truthful, so if Alex cheated, Casey would also have to cheat (from Blake's statement), but Casey is lying, which implies she didn't cheat. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait, let's try to construct a scenario where Blake is truthful and only Blake is truthful.\n\nIf Blake is truthful, then his statement holds: If Alex cheats, Casey cheats too. So, if Alex cheats, Casey must cheat. But if Alex doesn't cheat, Blake's statement doesn't tell us anything about Casey. Now, if only Blake is truthful, then both Alex and Casey must be lying.\n\nAlex is lying, so either Alex cheated or Casey cheated. Casey is lying, so either she cheated or she didn't cheat, and either Alex or Blake didn't do it. Wait, this is tricky. Let me try to map it out.\n\nCasey's statement: \"I didn't cheat, but either Alex or Blake did.\" Since Casey is lying, the entire statement is false. So, either she did cheat, or the second part is false. If she did cheat, then the second part is true (either Alex or Blake did), but since she's lying, the entire statement must be false, meaning she did cheat, and either Alex or Blake didn't do it. But that's a contradiction because if she did cheat, then someone must have done it. This is getting too convoluted.\n\nMaybe I should try the last possibility, where **Casey** is the one telling the truth.\n\nIf Casey is truthful, then her statement holds: She didn't cheat, but either Alex or Blake did. So, Casey didn't cheat. Now, since only Casey is truthful, both Alex and Blake must be lying.\n\nAlex is lying, so either Alex cheated or Casey cheated. But we know Casey didn't cheat, so Alex must have cheated. Blake is lying, so his statement \"If Alex cheats, then Casey cheats too\" must be false. Since Alex cheated, for Blake's statement to be false, the implication must be false. An implication is only false if the antecedent is true and the consequent is false. So, if Alex cheated, then Casey must not cheat for Blake's statement to be false. But Casey didn't cheat, so this scenario holds. Therefore, if Casey is truthful, Alex cheated, and Casey didn't cheat. That fits because Casey says she didn't cheat, and either Alex or Blake did, which is true because Alex did. Blake is lying because he said if Alex cheated, Casey would cheat, but Casey didn't cheat. So, this scenario works with exactly one person telling the truth.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that Alex cheated, and Casey didn't cheat. But wait, Casey says either Alex or Blake did, which is true because Alex did. So, the cheater is Alex.\n\nWait, but earlier when I considered Alex being truthful, it didn't hold because Blake's statement would also be true. So, the only scenario that fits is Casey being truthful, leading to Alex cheating. So, the answer is Alex.\n</think>\n\nAlex cheated on the exam.\n\nDONE."

    "solution": "Solve this problem step by step. End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: Three friends, Alex, Blake, and Casey, are suspected of cheating on an exam. During investigation, they made the following statements:\n\nAlex: 'I didn't cheat, and Casey didn't cheat either.'\nBlake: 'If Alex cheated, then Casey cheated too.'\nCasey: 'I didn't cheat, but either Alex or Blake did.'\n\nIf exactly one of them is telling the truth, who cheated on the exam? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this problem about three friends\u2014Alex, Blake, and Casey\u2014who are suspected of cheating on an exam. Each of them made a statement, and I need to figure out who cheated, given that exactly one of them is telling the truth. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll list out their statements to keep things clear:\n\n- **Alex**: \"I didn't cheat, and Casey didn't cheat either.\"\n- **Blake**: \"If Alex cheated, then Casey cheated too.\"\n- **Casey**: \"I didn't cheat, but either Alex or Blake did.\"\n\nNow, the key piece of information is that exactly one of them is telling the truth. That means two of them are lying, and only one is telling the truth. My goal is to determine who is lying, who is telling the truth, and consequently, who cheated.\n\nLet me consider each possibility one by one.\n\n**Case 1: Alex is telling the truth.**\n\nIf Alex is truthful, then two things must be true:\n1. Alex didn't cheat.\n2. Casey didn't cheat.\n\nSince Alex is telling the truth, Blake and Casey must both be lying.\n\nNow, let's see what Blake's statement implies. Blake says, \"If Alex cheated, then Casey cheated too.\" But if Alex is telling the truth, Alex didn't cheat. So the condition of Blake's statement (\"If Alex cheated\") is false. In logic, if the \"if\" part is false, the entire statement is considered true regardless of the \"then\" part. So Blake's statement is actually true. But this contradicts our initial assumption that Blake is lying. Therefore, this case leads to a contradiction. So, Alex cannot be the one telling the truth.\n\n**Case 2: Blake is telling the truth.**\n\nIf Blake is truthful, then his statement holds: \"If Alex cheated, then Casey cheated too.\" Now, since exactly one person is telling the truth, both Alex and Casey must be lying.\n\nLet's analyze Alex's lie: \"I didn't cheat, and Casey didn't cheat either.\" If Alex is lying, at least one part of his statement is false. It could mean he cheated, or Casey cheated, or both. But since Blake is truthful, if Alex cheated, Casey must have cheated too. So, if Alex is lying about not cheating, he does cheat, and by Blake's statement, Casey also cheats. But wait, that would mean both Alex and Casey cheated, making two cheaters, but we only need one cheater. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Alex is lying about Casey not cheating, meaning Casey does cheat. But then, if Blake is truthful, and if Alex cheated, Casey would have to cheat as well. So, either way, it seems like both Alex and Casey would be cheating, which would mean two people cheated, but we can only have one. This suggests a problem with this case. Maybe I need to reevaluate.\n\nWait, perhaps Alex is lying about not cheating, but Casey didn't cheat. But if Alex is lying, then either he cheated or Casey cheated. If he's lying, he could have cheated, but Casey didn't. But then, Blake's statement says if Alex cheats, Casey must cheat. But in this scenario, Alex cheats, but Casey doesn't, which would make Blake's statement false. That contradicts Blake being the one telling the truth. So, this case is also leading to a contradiction. Therefore, Blake cannot be the one telling the truth.\n\n**Case 3: Casey is telling the truth.**\n\nIf Casey is truthful, then her statement is true: \"I didn't cheat, but either Alex or Blake did.\" So, Casey didn't cheat, but either Alex or Blake did. Since exactly one person is telling the truth, both Alex and Blake must be lying.\n\nNow, let's see what Alex is lying about. Alex says, \"I didn't cheat, and Casey didn't cheat either.\" If Alex is lying, then at least one part is false. Since Casey is telling the truth, Casey didn't cheat, so the second part of Alex's statement is true. Therefore, the first part of Alex's statement must be false, meaning Alex did cheat. So, Alex is the cheater.\n\nBlake's statement is also a lie. Blake says, \"If Alex cheated, then Casey cheated too.\" Since Alex did cheat, and Casey didn't cheat, the implication is false because the \"if\" part is true, but the \"then\" part is false. In logic, a false implication is considered a lie. So, Blake's statement is indeed a lie, which fits our scenario where only Casey is telling the truth.\n\nSo, in this case, Alex is the cheater, Blake is lying, and Casey is truthful. This seems to fit all the conditions without any contradictions.\n\nLet me just double-check to ensure I didn't miss anything.\n\n- Casey didn't cheat (as per her truthful statement).\n- Either Alex or Blake cheated. Since we've established Alex cheated, that's satisfied.\n- Alex is lying about not cheating and Casey not cheating (since Alex did cheat).\n- Blake's statement is a lie because he claimed that if Alex cheated, Casey would too, which isn't the case here.\n  \nEverything checks out. So, the only person who cheated is Alex.\n</think>\n\nAlex is the one who cheated on the exam.\n\nDONE."
