Customers arrive at random according to a Poisson process with an average of 12 customers per hour. Upon arrival, a customer joins the shortest queue (if both queues are the same length, they choose randomly). Each cashier takes an average of 4 minutes to serve a customer, and service times follow an exponential distribution. At a random point in the day during steady-state operation, what is the probability that a newly arriving customer will find both cashiers idle (no customers waiting in line or being served)? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this problem about a small shop with two cashiers. Customers arrive randomly following a Poisson process with an average of 12 customers per hour. Each customer joins the shortest queue, and if both queues are the same length, they choose randomly. The service time for each customer is 4 minutes on average, following an exponential distribution. I need to find the probability that a newly arriving customer will find both cashiers idle at a random point in time during steady-state operation.\n\nHmm, okay. Let me break this down. First, I remember that in a Poisson process, the time between arrivals is exponentially distributed. The average rate here is 12 customers per hour, so the arrival rate \u03bb is 12 per hour. Since the time unit is in minutes, I should convert that to per minute. So \u03bb = 12 customers per 60 minutes, which is 0.2 customers per minute.\n\nEach cashier has an average service time of 4 minutes, so the service rate \u03bc is 1/4 customers per minute. Since there are two cashiers, the combined service rate would be 2 * (1/4) = 0.5 customers per minute.\n\nWait, but the problem is about the probability that a new customer arrives and finds both cashiers idle. So, at the moment the customer arrives, both registers should be free, and there should be no one waiting in line.\n\nHmm, how do I model this? Maybe I can model the system as a queueing system with two servers (cashiers) each with rate \u03bc. The arrival rate is \u03bb, and the service times are exponential.\n\nI think this is a problem that can be approached using the concept of \"steady-state\" in queueing systems. In steady-state, the system is in a recurring state where the time averages equal the state averages.\n\nI recall that for a single server, the probability that a customer finds the server idle is (\u03bc/\u03bb). But here, we have two servers, and we need both to be idle. So, maybe the probability is the product of each server being idle, but I need to consider the correlation between the two servers.\n\nWait, but since the customers join the shortest queue, if the queues are equal, they choose randomly. Does this affect the probability? Hmm, maybe not directly for the idle probability, but perhaps for the overall system behavior.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model this as a Markov chain with states representing the number of customers in each queue. But that might get complicated with two queues.\n\nWait, another approach: in the steady-state, the system is such that the average number of customers in the system is \u03bb/\u03bc, which for two servers is (12 customers per hour) / (1/4 per minute) = 12 * 4 = 48 customers in the system on average. So, 24 in each queue on average.\n\nBut we need the probability that both queues are empty when a new customer arrives. Hmm, so the new customer will join the shortest queue, but if both are empty, it can go to either.\n\nWait, but the question is about the probability that both cashiers are idle, meaning both registers are free, and there are no customers waiting in line. So, the arrival of a new customer will join the shortest queue, but if both queues are empty, it can choose either.\n\nBut the question is about the probability that both cashiers are idle, so we need the probability that when a customer arrives, both registers are free, and there are zero customers in both queues.\n\nSo, maybe I can model this using the concept of the \"system busy probability\" for multiple servers.\n\nWait, for a single server, the probability that the server is busy is (\u03bb/\u03bc), and idle is (\u03bc/\u03bb). But for two servers, it's a bit different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the system as two independent M/M/1 queues, but they share the same arrival process.\n\nWait, but customers choose the shortest queue. So, if one queue is longer than the other, they join the shorter one. If they are equal, they choose randomly. This might complicate things.\n\nBut since we are looking for the probability that both are idle, maybe the fact that they choose the shortest doesn't directly affect the probability that both are idle. Because if both are idle, they can choose either.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model the system as a single server with a certain service rate, but that's probably not the case.\n\nWait, another idea: in the steady-state, the time between arrivals is exponential with rate \u03bb. The service times are exponential with rate \u03bc. So, the process is memoryless.\n\nSo, the probability that both servers are idle at a random time t is equal to the probability that the last customer was served before time t - 4 minutes, since each service takes 4 minutes on average.\n\nWait, that might be a way to model it. Let me think.\n\nThe time between arrivals is exponential with rate \u03bb=0.2 per minute. The service times are exponential with rate \u03bc=0.25 per minute.\n\nSo, the system can be thought of as a Poisson process arriving, and each customer is served by one of the two servers, each with rate \u03bc.\n\nBut the assignment of customers to servers is based on the shortest queue, which complicates things.\n\nWait, but in the steady-state, the system is such that the average number of customers in each queue is 24, as I calculated earlier.\n\nBut I need the probability that both queues are empty when a customer arrives.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model the system as a single server with a service rate of 2\u03bc, because there are two servers. So, the combined service rate is 2\u03bc = 0.5 per minute.\n\nBut the arrival rate is \u03bb=0.2 per minute. So, for a single server with rate 2\u03bc, the probability that it's idle is \u03bc/(\u03bb + \u03bc) = 0.25/(0.2 + 0.25) = 0.25/0.45 \u2248 0.5556.\n\nBut that's for a single server. Wait, but here we have two servers, so the probability that both are idle is higher.\n\nWait, no. Because each server is independent in terms of service, but the arrival process is the same.\n\nWait, maybe I can think of it as the probability that the next arrival finds both servers idle. Since the arrival process is Poisson, the time between arrivals is exponential.\n\nSo, the time since the last customer was served by either server is exponential with rate 2\u03bc=0.5 per minute.\n\nWait, but the service times are exponential, so the time until the next customer is served is exponential with rate \u03bc=0.25 per server.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to find the probability that the time since the last customer was served by both servers is more than 4 minutes, since each service takes 4 minutes on average.\n\nWait, no. Because each service is 4 minutes on average, but the time between services is exponential with rate \u03bc=0.25 per minute.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Let's model the system as two independent exponential servers with rate \u03bc each, but the arrival process is Poisson with rate \u03bb.\n\nIn the steady-state, the probability that a server is busy is \u03bb/\u03bc, so for each server, the probability of being busy is 0.2/0.25=0.8.\n\nBut the two servers are not independent because they share the same arrival process.\n\nWait, but the assignment of customers to servers affects the correlation between their busy states.\n\nHmm, maybe I can model this as a Markov chain where the state is the number of customers in each queue.\n\nBut that might get too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, I recall that for two servers with Poisson arrivals and exponential service times, the probability that both are idle can be found by considering the time since the last customer was served.\n\nSince the service times are exponential, the time until the next customer is served is exponential with rate 2\u03bc=0.5 per minute.\n\nWait, because each server can serve a customer every \u03bc minutes, so combined, they can serve customers at a rate of 2\u03bc.\n\nSo, the time until the next customer is served is exponential with rate 2\u03bc.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the time since the last customer was served is greater than t is e^(-2\u03bc t).\n\nWait, but we need the probability that both servers are idle, meaning that the last customer was served at least 4 minutes ago, because each service takes 4 minutes on average.\n\nWait, no, because the service time is exponential, the time until the next customer is served is exponential, but the service duration itself is 4 minutes on average.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think in terms of the service completion times.\n\nEach server serves a customer in 4 minutes on average, but the inter-arrival times are exponential with rate \u03bb=0.2 per minute.\n\nSo, the system is a Poisson process arriving, and each customer is being served by one of the two servers, each with exponential service times.\n\nThe key here is that the service times are memoryless, so the time until the next service completion is exponential.\n\nTherefore, the time until the next service completion by both servers is the maximum of two exponential variables, but that might not be the right approach.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think that the combined service rate is 2\u03bc, so the time until the next service completion is exponential with rate 2\u03bc=0.5 per minute.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the time since the last service completion is greater than 4 minutes is e^(-0.5*4)=e^(-2)= about 0.1353.\n\nBut wait, is that the probability that both servers are idle?\n\nHmm, no, because the service completion time is the time when both servers are free again. So, if the last service completion was t minutes ago, then at time t, both servers are free.\n\nBut the arrival process is Poisson, so the time between arrivals is exponential.\n\nWait, maybe I need to model the system as a single server with a service rate of 2\u03bc, and the arrival rate is \u03bb.\n\nThe probability that a customer finds the server idle is \u03bc/(\u03bb + \u03bc).\n\nBut in this case, the server is two cashiers, so the effective service rate is 2\u03bc.\n\nTherefore, the probability that a customer finds both cashiers idle is \u03bc/(\u03bb + \u03bc) = 0.25/(0.2 + 0.25)=0.25/0.45\u22480.5556.\n\nWait, but that's for a single server. But here, we have two servers, so maybe the probability is higher.\n\nWait, no, because the two servers are effectively increasing the service rate, so the probability that the system is idle should be higher.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think of it as the probability that the time since the last arrival is greater than the service time.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model the system as a single server with service rate 2\u03bc, and the arrival rate \u03bb.\n\nThe probability that the server is idle is (\u03bc)/(\u03bb + \u03bc).\n\nBut in this case, the server is two cashiers, so the effective service rate is 2\u03bc, so the probability that both are idle is (\u03bc)/(\u03bb + \u03bc)=0.25/(0.2 + .25)=0.25/0.45\u22480.5556.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if this is correct because the two cashiers can serve customers in parallel, so the probability that both are idle should be higher than for a single server.\n\nWait, let me think differently.\n\nIn the steady-state, the system is such that the average number of customers in the system is \u03bb/\u03bc_total, where \u03bc_total is the total service rate.\n\nHere, \u03bc_total=2\u03bc=0.5 per minute.\n\nSo, \u03bb/\u03bc_total=0.2/0.5=0.4 customers in the system on average.\n\nBut that's the total number of customers in the system, not per queue.\n\nWait, each queue would have half of that, so 0.2 customers on average in each queue.\n\nBut we need the probability that both queues are empty.\n\nHmm, maybe I can model this using the concept of \"Little's Law,\" which states that the average number of customers in the system is equal to the average arrival rate divided by the average service rate.\n\nWhich we have: 0.2/0.5=0.4 customers in the system.\n\nBut how does that help with the probability that both queues are empty?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider the system as a single queue with two servers, but the customers choose the shortest queue.\n\nWait, but in the steady-state, the queues balance out, so each queue has 0.2 customers on average.\n\nBut we need the probability that both queues are empty when a new customer arrives.\n\nWait, so when a new customer arrives, they will join the shortest queue. If both queues are equal, they choose randomly.\n\nBut the probability that both queues are empty is when the new customer is the first one in the day, or after both servers have just finished serving.\n\nBut in the steady-state, the system is such that the arrival process is Poisson, and the service times are exponential.\n\nTherefore, the time between arrivals is exponential with rate \u03bb=0.2 per minute, and the service times are exponential with rate \u03bc=0.25 per minute.\n\nSo, the time until the next arrival is exponential with rate 0.2, and the time until the next service completion is exponential with rate 0.25 per server.\n\nBut since there are two servers, the combined service rate is 0.5 per minute.\n\nWait, perhaps I can model the system as a single server with service rate 0.5 per minute, and the arrival rate is 0.2 per minute.\n\nThen, the probability that the server is idle is \u03bc_total/(\u03bb + \u03bc_total)=0.5/(0.2 + 0.5)=0.5/0.7\u22480.7143.\n\nBut wait, this is for a single server. But in our case, we have two servers, so the probability that both are idle should be higher.\n\nWait, but no, because the two servers are in parallel, so the effective service rate is 0.5 per minute, so the probability that the system is idle is higher.\n\nWait, but I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the system being a single server with service rate 2\u03bc, so the probability that it's idle is \u03bc/(\u03bb + \u03bc)=0.25/(0.2 +0.25)=0.25/0.45\u22480.5556.\n\nBut again, this is for a single server.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to model the system as two independent M/M/1 queues with rate \u03bc each, but sharing the same arrival process.\n\nThe probability that both are idle is the probability that the time since the last arrival is greater than the sum of the service times.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, another approach: the system is a single queue with two servers. The arrival rate is \u03bb=0.2 per minute, and the service rate is \u03bc_total=0.5 per minute.\n\nIn the steady-state, the probability that the system is empty (both servers idle) can be found by considering the ratio of the service rate to the sum of arrival and service rates.\n\nWait, the formula for the stationary distribution of the number of customers in the system is given by the Poisson distribution, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe I can use the formula for the probability that a system is empty. For a single server, the probability of being empty is \u03bc/\u03bb. But for multiple servers, it's different.\n\nWait, I recall that for a system with multiple servers, the probability that all servers are idle is given by (\u03bc/(\u03bb + \u03bc))^n, where n is the number of servers.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's correct.\n\nWait, let's test for n=1: (\u03bc/(\u03bb + \u03bc))^1=\u03bc/(\u03bb + \u03bc), which is correct for a single server.\n\nSo, for n=2, it would be (\u03bc/(\u03bb + \u03bc))^2.\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers: (0.25/(0.2 +0.25))^2=(0.25/0.45)^2\u2248(0.5556)^2\u22480.3086.\n\nBut wait, is this correct?\n\nWait, another way: the system can be considered as a single server with service rate 2\u03bc, so the probability that it's idle is \u03bc/(\u03bb + \u03bc)=0.25/(0.2 +0.25)=0.25/0.45\u22480.5556.\n\nBut since there are two servers, the probability that both are idle is higher.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if (\u03bc/(\u03bb + \u03bc))^n is the correct formula.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the probability that both are idle is (\u03bc/(\u03bb + \u03bc))^2.\n\nBut let's think about it differently.\n\nThe time until the next customer is served by both servers is exponential with rate 2\u03bc=0.5 per minute.\n\nSo, the probability that the time since the last customer was served is greater than t is e^(-0.5 t).\n\nWe need the probability that both servers are idle when a new customer arrives, which would require that the time since the last customer was served by both servers is greater than 4 minutes.\n\nWait, no, because each service takes 4 minutes on average, but the service times are exponential.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think in terms of the service completion times.\n\nEach server serves a customer in 4 minutes on average, so the time until the next service completion is exponential with rate \u03bc=0.25 per minute.\n\nSo, the time until the next service completion by either server is the minimum of two exponential variables with rate 0.25 each, which is exponential with rate 0.5.\n\nSo, the time until the next service completion is exponential with rate 0.5 per minute.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the time since the last service completion is greater than t is e^(-0.5 t).\n\nBut we need the probability that both servers are idle, which would mean that the last service completion by both servers was at least 4 minutes ago.\n\nWait, but that's not quite right because each service takes 4 minutes, so the time until the next service completion is exponential, but the duration of the service is 4 minutes.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to model the system as a single server with service rate 2\u03bc, so the effective service rate is 0.5 per minute.\n\nThen, the probability that the server is idle is \u03bc_total/(\u03bb + \u03bc_total)=0.5/(0.2 +0.5)=0.5/0.7\u22480.7143.\n\nBut that's for a single server.

Customers arrive at random according to a Poisson process with an average of 12 customers per hour. Upon arrival, a customer joins the shortest queue (if both queues are the same length, they choose randomly). Each cashier takes an average of 4 minutes to serve a customer, and service times follow an exponential distribution. At a random point in the day during steady-state operation, what is the probability that a newly arriving customer will find both cashiers idle (no customers waiting in line or being served)? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this problem here about a small shop with two cashiers. Let me try to understand it step by step. \n\nFirst, the customers arrive randomly according to a Poisson process, which has an average of 12 customers per hour. That means every hour, on average, 12 customers come in. Poisson processes are memoryless, right? So the time between arrivals doesn't depend on how long it's been since the last customer.\n\nWhen a customer arrives, they join the shortest queue. If both queues are the same length, they choose randomly between the two cashiers. Each cashier takes an average of 4 minutes to serve a customer, and the service times follow an exponential distribution. So, the time taken to serve each customer is exponential with a mean of 4 minutes.\n\nThe question is asking: At a random point in time during steady-state operation, what's the probability that a newly arriving customer will find both cashiers idle? That means neither cashier is serving a customer, and there are no customers waiting in line at either register.\n\nHmm, okay. So I need to find the probability that when a customer arrives, both registers are free. In other words, both cashiers are not currently serving someone, and there's no one waiting in either queue.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. Since the process is in steady-state, we can use some properties of Poisson processes and maybe some queueing theory.\n\nFirst, let's note that the arrival rate is \u03bb = 12 customers per hour. To make calculations easier, let me convert that to per minute because the service time is given in minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so \u03bb = 12 / 60 = 0.2 customers per minute.\n\nEach cashier has a service rate \u03bc = 1 / 4 minutes per customer. So, the service rate per cashier is \u03bc = 0.25 customers per minute. Since there are two cashiers, the total service rate is 2\u03bc = 0.5 customers per minute.\n\nWait, but actually, each cashier can serve one customer at a time, right? So the total service capacity is two customers being served simultaneously.\n\nBut the problem is about the state of the system when a new customer arrives. So we need to find the probability that both registers are idle when a customer arrives. That is, the system is empty, or both registers are free.\n\nBut wait, no. It's not exactly when the system is empty. It's when the new customer arrives and finds both registers idle. So, it's possible that there are customers being served, but not by both registers. Or maybe both registers are busy.\n\nWait, no. The question is specifically about the probability that both cashiers are idle. So, the customer arrives and both registers are free. So, at that exact moment, no one is being served, and there's no one waiting in either queue.\n\nSo, to model this, I think we can model the system as a Markov chain with states representing the number of customers being served by each cashier. Since each cashier can be either busy or idle, the state can be represented as (0,0), (1,0), (0,1), or (1,1), where the first number is the number of customers at register 1, and the second is the number at register 2. But actually, since each register can only serve one customer at a time, the state is more accurately represented by whether each register is busy or not, and how many customers are waiting in each queue.\n\nBut maybe a better approach is to consider the system as having two servers, each with their own queue. The arrival process is Poisson, and the service times are exponential. So, the system is in steady-state, and we can use the concept of Little's Law or maybe some steady-state probability distribution.\n\nAlternatively, since the system is in steady-state, the time between arrivals is exponential with rate \u03bb, and the service times are exponential with rate \u03bc. So, the system can be modeled as a M/M/2 queue, but I think it's more about the queueing state when a new customer arrives.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to model the system as two independent queues, each with service rate \u03bc, but customers can choose which queue to join based on the shortest queue or random if equal.\n\nBut the problem is asking for the probability that both queues are empty when a new customer arrives. So, when a customer arrives, they see both queues empty. So, the system is empty, and the customer can choose either register, but the probability that both registers are empty is the probability that the system is empty when the customer arrives.\n\nBut wait, no, the customer is arriving and finds both registers idle. So, it's not just the system being empty, but specifically that both registers are idle. So, even if the system is not empty, if the arriving customer can find both registers free, that's the probability we're looking for.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to model the system as a two-server queue where each server can be in a busy or idle state, and the arrival rate is \u03bb, and service rate per server is \u03bc.\n\nIn steady-state, the probability that a server is busy can be found using the formula p = \u03bb / (\u03bb + \u03bc). Since each server has the same service rate, the probability that any one server is busy is p = \u03bb / (\u03bb + \u03bc).\n\nBut wait, in this case, the two servers are not independent because customers can choose which queue to join based on the shortest queue. So, the arrival process isn't entirely Poisson for each server, because customers can choose which server to join.\n\nThis complicates things because the queues are not independent. So, we can't directly use the formula for a single server queue.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the system as a single server with two possible states, but that might not capture the dynamics correctly.\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to consider the system as a two-server queue where each server has a service rate of \u03bc, and the arrival rate is \u03bb, but customers choose the shortest queue. So, when a customer arrives, they choose the shorter queue; if they're equal, they choose randomly.\n\nIn such a system, the steady-state probability distribution can be found, and from that, we can find the probability that both queues are empty when a customer arrives.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use the concept of the system being in a state where both servers are idle, and find the probability of that state.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure about the exact approach. Maybe I should look into the concept of \"state occupancy\" in a multi-server queue.\n\nWait, another idea: Since the system is in steady-state, the time between arrivals is exponential with rate \u03bb, and the service times are exponential with rate \u03bc. So, the system can be modeled as a Markov chain with states representing the number of customers in each queue.\n\nBut because customers can choose which queue to join, the system's behavior is a bit more complex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can consider the system as a single queue with two servers, and the arrival rate is \u03bb, and the service rate per server is \u03bc. Then, the total service rate is 2\u03bc.\n\nBut the problem is that customers choose the shortest queue, which complicates the arrival process.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model this as a single Poisson arrival process, where each customer chooses the shortest queue. So, the arrival rate to each server depends on the number of customers in each queue.\n\nBut this seems complicated.\n\nWait, maybe instead of thinking about the entire system, I can think about the state of the system when a customer arrives. So, the customer arrives and finds both registers idle. So, the probability that both registers are idle is the probability that the system is in state (0,0) when a customer arrives.\n\nIn a two-server queue, the probability that the system is empty when a customer arrives is given by the formula:\n\nP(0) = (\u03bc1 + \u03bc2) / (\u03bb + \u03bc1 + \u03bc2)\n\nBut in our case, \u03bc1 = \u03bc2 = \u03bc, since both servers have the same service rate.\n\nSo, P(0) = (\u03bc + \u03bc) / (\u03bb + \u03bc + \u03bc) = (2\u03bc) / (\u03bb + 2\u03bc)\n\nBut wait, is this correct? I think this formula is for a single server queue, but we have two servers. So, perhaps this doesn't apply directly.\n\nAlternatively, I recall that in a multi-server queue, the probability that the system is empty when a customer arrives is given by:\n\nP(0) = (\u03bc_total) / (\u03bb + \u03bc_total)\n\nWhere \u03bc_total is the total service rate.\n\nIn our case, \u03bc_total = 2\u03bc.\n\nSo, P(0) = (2\u03bc) / (\u03bb + 2\u03bc)\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n\u03bb = 12 customers per hour = 0.2 per minute\n\n\u03bc = 4 minutes per customer = 1/4 per minute\n\nSo, \u03bc = 0.25 per minute\n\nThus, \u03bc_total = 2 * 0.25 = 0.5 per minute\n\nSo, P(0) = 0.5 / (0.2 + 0.5) = 0.5 / 0.7 \u2248 0.7143\n\nSo, approximately 71.43% probability that the system is empty when a customer arrives.\n\nBut wait, I'm not sure if this applies to our case because the arrival process is not Poisson for each server, but rather, customers choose the shortest queue.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to adjust for that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the probability that both servers are idle is equal to the probability that the system is empty, which is P(0) = (\u03bc_total) / (\u03bb + \u03bc_total) = 0.5 / 0.7 \u2248 0.7143.\n\nBut I'm not entirely confident. Let me think again.\n\nIn a single-server queue, the probability that the system is empty when a customer arrives is indeed P(0) = \u03bc / (\u03bb + \u03bc). But for multi-server queues, I think it's similar but scaled by the total service rate.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is P(0) = (\u03bc_total) / (\u03bb + \u03bc_total). So, for two servers each with rate \u03bc, P(0) = 2\u03bc / (\u03bb + 2\u03bc). That makes sense because the total service rate is 2\u03bc.\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers:\n\n\u03bb = 0.2 per minute\n\n\u03bc = 0.25 per minute\n\nTotal \u03bc = 0.5 per minute\n\nThus, P(0) = 0.5 / (0.2 + 0.5) = 0.5 / 0.7 \u2248 0.7143\n\nSo, about 71.43%.\n\nBut wait, the problem is that customers are choosing the shortest queue, so the arrival rate to each server isn't exactly \u03bb, but depends on the number of customers in each queue.\n\nThis complicates things because the arrival rate to each server is not independent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as a single Poisson arrival process with rate \u03bb, but the customers are distributed between two servers based on the shortest queue.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to compute the probability in that case.\n\nWait, another approach: The system is in steady-state, so the time between arrivals is exponential with rate \u03bb, and the service times are exponential with rate \u03bc.\n\nSo, the probability that both servers are idle is the probability that the system is empty, which is P(0) = (\u03bc_total) / (\u03bb + \u03bc_total) = 0.5 / 0.7 \u2248 0.7143.\n\nBut I'm still not sure if this is correct because the customers are choosing the shortest queue, which might affect the distribution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the probability that both servers are idle is equal to the probability that the system is empty, which is the same as the probability that the last customer has just been served and the system is empty.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe I can think of it as a single server with two possible states: either the customer goes to server 1 or server 2. So, the system can be modeled as a single server with a service rate of \u03bc, but with two possible servers that can be chosen based on the shortest queue.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the probability that both servers are idle is equal to the probability that the system is in state (0,0) when a customer arrives, which can be found by considering the ratio of the total service rate to the sum of the arrival rate and the total service rate.\n\nSo, P(0) = (\u03bc1 + \u03bc2) / (\u03bb + \u03bc1 + \u03bc2) = (\u03bc + \u03bc) / (\u03bb + 2\u03bc) = 2\u03bc / (\u03bb + 2\u03bc)\n\nWhich is the same as before, 0.5 / 0.7 \u2248 0.7143.\n\nSo, I think that's the correct approach.\n\nTherefore, the probability that a newly arriving customer will find both cashiers idle is approximately 71.43%.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nWait, another way to think about it: The time between arrivals is exponential with rate \u03bb, and the time until the next customer arrives is T ~ Exp(\u03bb). The time until both servers become free is T' ~ Exp(\u03bc_total), since the total service rate is 2\u03bc.\n\nBut wait, the time until both servers are free is the maximum of two exponential variables, each with rate \u03bc.\n\nWait, no, because each server can only serve one customer at a time. So, the time until both servers are free is the maximum of two exponential variables with rate \u03bc, but since they are independent, the joint distribution is the maximum.\n\nWait, but the time until the next customer arrives is T ~ Exp(\u03bb), and the time until both servers are free is T' ~ Exp(\u03bc_total). So, the probability that T' < T is the probability that the servers are free before the next customer arrives.\n\nBut we need the probability that T' = T, because that's when a customer arrives and finds both servers free.\n\nWait, no, that's not quite right. Because T is the time until the next arrival, and T' is the time until both servers are free. So, if T' < T, then the servers are free when the next customer arrives, which is what we want.\n\nWait, no, we want the probability that when a customer arrives, both servers are free. So, the time until the next arrival is T, and the time until both servers are free is T'. So, if T' < T, then when the customer arrives at time T, the servers are still free.\n\nWait, no, actually, the customer arrives at time T, and if T' < T, that means the servers have been free for T' time, which is less than T, so they are still free when the customer arrives.\n\nWait, but T' is the time until both servers are free, so if T' < T, then the servers are free when the next customer arrives.\n\nBut we want the probability that when a customer arrives, both servers are free, which is equivalent to T' < T.\n\nBut T is Exp(\u03bb), and T' is Exp(\u03bc_total). So, the probability that T' < T is the probability that an Exp(\u03bc_total) variable is less than an Exp(\u03bb) variable.\n\nBut since both are exponential, the joint distribution is that T' is Exp(\u03bc_total) and T is Exp(\u03bb), independent.\n\nSo, the probability that T' < T is equal to the integral over t from 0 to infinity of P(T' < t) * f_T(t) dt.\n\nBut f_T(t) is \u03bb e^{-\u03bb t}, and P(T' < t) is 1 - e^{-\u03bc_total t}.\n\nSo, the probability is \u222b\u2080^\u221e (1 - e^{-\u03bc_total t}) \u03bb e^{-\u03bb t} dt.\n\nLet me compute that.\n\nLet me denote \u03bc_total = \u03bc1 + \u03bc2 = 2\u03bc = 0.5 per minute.\n\n\u03bb = 0.2 per minute.\n\nSo, the integral becomes:\n\n\u222b\u2080^\u221e (1 - e^{-0.5 t}) * 0.2 e^{-0.2 t} dt\n\n= 0.2 \u222b\u2080^\u221e e^{-0.2 t} dt - 0.2 \u222b\u2080^\u221e e^{-(0.5 + 0.2) t} dt\n\n= 0.2 * [1 / 0.2] - 0.2 * [1 / 0.7]\n\n= (0.2 / 0.2) - (0.2 / 0.7)\n\n= 1 - (2/7)\n\n\u2248 1 - 0.2857 \u2248 0.7143\n\nSo, that's the same result as before, 0.7143 or 71.43%.\n\nTherefore, the probability that a newly arriving customer will find both cashiers idle is approximately 71.43%.\n\nSo, the final answer is 5/7, which is approximately 0.7143.\n\nWait, 5/7 is approximately 0.7143, yes.\n\nSo, the exact probability is 5/7.\n\nBecause 0.5 / (0.2 + 0.5) = 0.5 / 0.7 = 5/7.\n\nYes, so 5/7 is the exact value.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 5/7.\n\nSo, the answer is 5/7.\n</think>\n\nThe probability that a newly arriving customer will find both cashiers idle is 5/7.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe probability is 5/7.\n\nDONE."

    "solution": "Solve this problem step by step. End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: A small shop has two cashiers working at different registers. Customers arrive at random according to a Poisson process with an average of 12 customers per hour. Upon arrival, a customer joins the shortest queue (if both queues are the same length, they choose randomly). Each cashier takes an average of 4 minutes to serve a customer, and service times follow an exponential distribution. At a random point in the day during steady-state operation, what is the probability that a newly arriving customer will find both cashiers idle (no customers waiting in line or being served)? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the probability that a newly arriving customer will find both cashiers idle when they get to the shop. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the shop has two cashiers, and customers arrive according to a Poisson process. The average number of customers per hour is 12. That means the rate \u03bb is 12 customers per hour. Each customer joins the shortest queue, and if both queues are the same length, they choose randomly. Each cashier takes an average of 4 minutes to serve a customer, and the service times are exponentially distributed. \n\nI remember that in queuing theory, the Poisson process is memoryless, and exponential distributions are often used to model service times because they have the memoryless property. So, maybe I can model each cashier's queue as a M/M/1 or M/M/2 queue? Wait, no, actually, each cashier is a single-server queue, so each is M/M/1. But since there are two cashiers, I need to model the system as two M/M/1 queues in tandem.\n\nBut the question is about the steady-state probability that a new customer arrives and finds both cashiers idle. That is, the probability that both queues are empty when the customer arrives. Hmm, how do I calculate that?\n\nI recall that for a single M/M/1 queue, the steady-state probability that the server is idle is 1/(\u03bb\u03bc), where \u03bb is the arrival rate and \u03bc is the service rate. So, for one cashier, the probability that they are idle is 1/(12 * (1/4)) because \u03bc = 1/4 per minute. Wait, let me check: \u03bc is the service rate, which is 1 divided by the average service time. Since each cashier takes 4 minutes on average, \u03bc = 1/4 per minute. So, the probability that a single cashier is idle is 1/(\u03bb/\u03bc) = \u03bc/\u03bb = (1/4)/12 = 1/48 \u2248 0.0208.\n\nBut wait, that's for one cashier. The problem asks for both cashiers being idle. So, I need the probability that both cashiers are idle. Are these events independent? Hmm, not exactly, because the arrival of a customer affects both queues.\n\nWait, no, actually, the customers are arriving according to a Poisson process, which is independent of the current state of the queues. So, the arrival process is independent of the system state. Therefore, the probability that both cashiers are idle is the product of each being idle? Wait, no, that's not quite right because if one cashier is busy, it affects the other.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to model the system as two independent M/M/1 queues, and find the probability that both are idle. But actually, the arrival process is to the system, not to each cashier. So, the customers choose the shortest queue, which complicates things a bit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model the system as a M/M/2 queue, where both servers can take customers. But in this case, the customers are choosing the shortest queue, so it's more like a balanced server or a random server.\n\nWait, no, in a M/M/2 system, each arrival chooses the shortest queue, which is what the problem says. So, the system is a M/M/2 queue with each server having rate \u03bc. So, the total service rate is 2\u03bc, and the arrival rate is \u03bb.\n\nBut the question is about the probability that both servers are idle when a customer arrives. In a M/M/2 queue, the probability that both servers are idle is 1/(\u03bb/(2\u03bc))\u00b2? Wait, no, that doesn't sound right.\n\nWait, I think I need to recall the formula for the idle probability in a M/M/n queue. The probability that all n servers are idle is 1/(\u03bb/\u03bc)^n. But wait, that's when the system is a M/M/n queue with all servers having the same rate. So, in our case, n=2, \u03bb=12, and \u03bc=1/4. So, the probability that both cashiers are idle would be 1/(\u03bb/\u03bc)^2 = 1/(12/(1/4))\u00b2 = 1/(48)^2 = 1/2304 \u2248 0.000434.\n\nWait, but is that correct? Because in a M/M/2 queue, the arrival rate \u03bb must be less than or equal to 2\u03bc for stability. Here, \u03bb=12 and 2\u03bc= 2*(1/4)=0.5. Wait, 12 is way larger than 0.5, so the system is unstable. That can't be, because the shop must be in steady-state, so the arrival rate must be less than or equal to the total service rate. But 12 > 0.5, so it's unstable. That doesn't make sense because the shop can't handle 12 customers per hour with only 0.5 service capacity per hour. So, perhaps I misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait, no, the cashiers are each serving customers at a rate of 4 minutes per customer, so each can serve 15 customers per hour (since 60/4=15). So, two cashiers can serve 30 customers per hour. Since the arrival rate is 12 per hour, which is less than 30, so the system is stable.\n\nBut earlier, I thought the service rate per cashier is \u03bc=1/4 per minute, so two cashiers have total service rate 2*(1/4)=0.5 per minute, which is 30 per hour. So, that's correct.\n\nBut when I calculated the probability that both are idle as 1/(\u03bb/(2\u03bc))\u00b2, that was for the M/M/2 queue. Wait, no, that formula is for the M/M/n queue where each server has rate \u03bc, so the total service rate is n\u03bc. The formula for the probability that all servers are idle is 1/(\u03bb/(n\u03bc))\u00b2? Wait, no, I think the formula is 1/(\u03bb/(n\u03bc))\u00b2 for the M/M/n/0 queue, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, actually, I think the probability that all n servers are idle is (n\u03bc/\u03bb)^n. So, in our case, n=2, so (2\u03bc/\u03bb)^2. Wait, that would be (2*(1/4)/12)^2 = (0.5/12)^2 = (1/24)^2 \u2248 0.000208.\n\nBut wait, that seems too low. Because if the system is stable, the probability of both being idle should be higher than that. Maybe I'm mixing up the formula.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should model the system as two independent M/M/1 queues, but with customers choosing the shortest queue. So, the arrival rate to each cashier would be half of the total arrival rate? No, because customers choose the shorter queue, so the arrival rate to each cashier is \u03bb/2, assuming the system is symmetric.\n\nBut in reality, the arrival rate to each cashier is not necessarily \u03bb/2 because the choice is dynamic. So, perhaps I need to use the formula for the steady-state probability that both servers are idle in a M/M/2 system.\n\nI think the formula is p = (\u03bc/\u03bb)^2. So, (1/4 / 12)^2 = (1/48)^2 = 1/2304 \u2248 0.000434. But earlier, I thought the system was unstable because 12 > 0.5, but actually, the total service rate is 30 per hour, so 12 < 30, so it's stable.\n\nWait, but in the M/M/2 model, the service rate is 2\u03bc, so the total service rate is 2*(1/4)=0.5 per minute, which is 30 per hour. So, the system is stable because \u03bb=12 < 30.\n\nBut the formula for the probability that both servers are idle in a M/M/2/0 queue is p = (\u03bc/\u03bb)^2. So, that would be (1/4 / 12)^2 = (1/48)^2 = 1/2304 \u2248 0.000434.\n\nBut wait, I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the probability is (\u03bc/\u03bb)^n, where n=2, so same as above.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the system as a single M/M/2 queue and use the formula for the probability that all servers are idle. For a M/M/2/0 queue, the probability that all servers are idle is (\u03bc/\u03bb)^2. So, same as above.\n\nBut let me double-check. For a M/M/n queue, the probability that all n servers are idle is p = (\u03bc/\u03bb)^n. So, yes, for n=2, it's (\u03bc/\u03bb)^2.\n\nSo, \u03bc=1/4 per minute, \u03bb=12 per hour. But wait, the units need to match. \u03bc is in per minute, \u03bb is in per minute. So, 12 per hour is 12/60 = 0.2 per minute.\n\nWait, wait, no. The arrival rate \u03bb is 12 customers per hour, which is 0.2 per minute. Service rate \u03bc is 1/4 per minute. So, \u03bc/\u03bb = (1/4)/0.2 = (1/4)/(1/5) = 5/4 = 1.25.\n\nSo, p = (\u03bc/\u03bb)^2 = (1.25)^2 = 1.5625.\n\nWait, that can't be, because the probability can't be greater than 1. So, I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, no, I think I confused the rates. Let me clarify.\n\nThe arrival rate \u03bb is 12 per hour, which is 12/60 = 0.2 per minute.\n\nThe service rate \u03bc is 1/4 per minute (since it takes 4 minutes per customer, so 1/4 per minute).\n\nTherefore, the ratio \u03bc/\u03bb is (1/4)/0.2 = (0.25)/0.2 = 1.25.\n\nSo, p = (\u03bc/\u03bb)^2 = (1.25)^2 = 1.5625, which is greater than 1, which is impossible because probabilities can't exceed 1.\n\nSo, clearly, I'm using the wrong formula here. Maybe the formula is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should model the system as two independent M/M/1 queues and find the probability that both are idle.\n\nFor a single M/M/1 queue, the probability that the server is idle is \u03bc/\u03bb = (1/4)/12 = 1/48 \u2248 0.0208.\n\nIf the two queues are independent, which they aren't because customers are choosing the shortest queue, the probability that both are idle would be (1/48)^2 \u2248 0.00043.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought the system is unstable because the total service rate is 0.5 per minute, which is 30 per hour, and \u03bb=12 < 30, so it's stable.\n\nWait, but in a M/M/2 system, the formula for the probability that all servers are idle is 1/(\u03bb/(2\u03bc))\u00b2. Wait, let me check:\n\nIn a M/M/2/0 system, the steady-state probability that all servers are idle is given by p = (2\u03bc/\u03bb)^2.\n\nWait, no, that can't be. Let me look up the formula.\n\nActually, I think the correct formula for the probability that all n servers are idle in a M/M/n/0 system is p = (\u03bc/\u03bb)^n.\n\nBut in our case, \u03bc=1/4 per minute, \u03bb=12 per hour=0.2 per minute.\n\nSo, \u03bc/\u03bb= (1/4)/0.2=1.25.\n\nThus, p= (1.25)^2=1.5625, which is greater than 1, which is impossible.\n\nSo, clearly, I'm using the wrong approach.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider the system as a single M/M/2 queue, but with the service rate per server being \u03bc, so the total service rate is 2\u03bc.\n\nBut in our case, each cashier's service rate is \u03bc=1/4 per minute, so total service rate is 0.5 per minute.\n\nThe arrival rate is \u03bb=12 per hour=0.2 per minute.\n\nSo, the system is stable because \u03bb < 2\u03bc (0.2 < 0.5).\n\nNow, the formula for the probability that all servers are idle in a M/M/2/0 system is p = (2\u03bc/\u03bb)^2.\n\nWait, let's plug in the numbers:\n\n2\u03bc = 0.5 per minute.\n\n\u03bb=0.2 per minute.\n\nSo, 2\u03bc/\u03bb=0.5/0.2=2.5.\n\nThen, p= (2.5)^2=6.25, which is still greater than 1.\n\nThis can't be right. I must be confusing the formula.\n\nWait, perhaps I should recall that in a M/M/2/0 system, the probability that all servers are idle is given by p = (\u03bc/\u03bb)^2.\n\nBut again, that gives (1/4 / 12)^2= (1/48)^2\u22480.00043.\n\nBut this seems too low, considering that the system is stable.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is different. Maybe for a M/M/2/0 system, the probability that all servers are idle is p = (\u03bc/\u03bb)^2.\n\nBut given that, and plugging in \u03bc=1/4 per minute, \u03bb=0.2 per minute, we get p=(0.25/0.2)^2=(1.25)^2=1.5625>1, which is impossible.\n\nTherefore, I must be misunderstanding the model.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to model each cashier as an M/M/1 queue, and find the probability that both are idle when a customer arrives.\n\nBut since customers choose the shortest queue, the arrival rate to each cashier is not necessarily \u03bb/2.\n\nWait, maybe I can model the system as two M/M/1 queues with a shared arrival process. The arrival rate to each queue is not independent because customers choose the shorter queue.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to model that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the steady-state probability that both queues are empty.\n\nWait, I found a reference that in a M/M/2/0 system, the probability that all servers are idle is given by p = (\u03bc/(\u03bb/2))^2.\n\nWait, let me think: if the arrival rate is \u03bb, and the service rate per server is \u03bc, then the total service rate is 2\u03bc.

Customers arrive at random according to a Poisson process with an average of 12 customers per hour. Upon arrival, a customer joins the shortest queue (if both queues are the same length, they choose randomly). Each cashier takes an average of 4 minutes to serve a customer, and service times follow an exponential distribution. At a random point in the day during steady-state operation, what is the probability that a newly arriving customer will find both cashiers idle (no customers waiting in line or being served)? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this problem about a small shop with two cashiers. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The problem says that customers arrive randomly according to a Poisson process, with an average of 12 customers per hour. When a customer arrives, they join the shortest queue. If both queues are the same length, they choose randomly. Each cashier takes an average of 4 minutes to serve a customer, and the service times follow an exponential distribution. I need to find the probability that a newly arriving customer will find both cashiers idle, meaning neither cashier is serving a customer or has anyone waiting in line.\n\nHmm, okay. So, first, I remember that in queuing theory, a Poisson process has customers arriving at a rate \u03bb, which in this case is 12 per hour. The service times are exponential with an average of 4 minutes. That means the service rate \u03bc is 1/4 customers per minute, or 15 customers per hour.\n\nSince there are two cashiers, the system can be thought of as a M/M/2 queue. In M/M/n notation, M is the inter-arrival time distribution (Poisson here), m is the service time distribution (exponential here), and n is the number of servers (2 in this case). \n\nThe question is about the steady-state probability that a new customer finds both cashiers idle. That is, when a customer arrives, both registers are free. So, the queue is empty at both registers.\n\nI recall that in a M/M/n system, the probability that all n servers are idle when a customer arrives is given by 1/\u03bb * \u03bc^n. Wait, is that correct? Let me think. \n\nNo, that doesn't seem right. Maybe it's different. Let me consider the steady-state probabilities in a M/M/2 system.\n\nIn a M/M/2 system, the steady-state probability that all servers are idle is actually 1/(\u03bb * \u03bc^2). Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should derive it.\n\nLet me denote the system as having two servers. Let\u2019s denote the arrival rate as \u03bb = 12 per hour, which is 12/60 = 0.2 per minute. The service rate is \u03bc = 1/4 per minute, so 15 per hour.\n\nBut let me convert everything to per minute for consistency. So \u03bb = 0.2 per minute, \u03bc = 0.25 per minute.\n\nIn a M/M/2 system, the probability that a new customer arrives and finds all servers idle is given by the formula:\n\nP = 1/(\u03bb * \u03bc^2)\n\nWait, is that the correct formula? Or is it 1/(\u03bb * \u03bc^2) for M/M/1? Hmm, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, I remember that in a M/M/n system, the probability that all servers are idle is 1/(\u03bb * \u03bc^n). So in this case, n=2, so it would be 1/(\u03bb * \u03bc^2).\n\nLet me check the units. \u03bb is per minute, \u03bc is per minute. So \u03bb * \u03bc^2 would be per minute * per minute squared, which is per minute cubed. That doesn't make sense for a probability, which should be dimensionless. Hmm, maybe the formula is different.\n\nWait, perhaps it's 1/(\u03bb * \u03bc)^n? No, that would be (per minute * per minute)^n, which is per minute^(2n), which is also not dimensionless.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's 1/(\u03bb * \u03bc^n). Let's see:\n\nIf n=1, then P = 1/(\u03bb * \u03bc). For M/M/1, the probability that the server is idle when a customer arrives is indeed 1/(\u03bb * \u03bc). That makes sense because the average time between arrivals is 1/\u03bb, and the average service time is 1/\u03bc. So the probability that they align perfectly is 1/(\u03bb * \u03bc).\n\nExtending this to n=2, the probability that both servers are idle would be 1/(\u03bb * \u03bc^2). So for our case, \u03bb=0.2, \u03bc=0.25.\n\nTherefore, P = 1/(0.2 * (0.25)^2) = 1/(0.2 * 0.0625) = 1/(0.0125) = 80.\n\nWait, that can't be right. A probability can't be more than 1. I must have messed up the formula.\n\nLet me rethink this. Maybe it's not 1/(\u03bb * \u03bc^2). Perhaps it's the product of the individual probabilities, but that doesn't seem right either.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's the probability that both servers are busy, and then 1 minus that.\n\nWait, I think I need to model this correctly. Let me consider the system in steady state.\n\nIn a M/M/2 system, the steady-state probability that all servers are busy is given by:\n\nP_all_busy = (\u03bb/\u03bc)^2 / (1 + (\u03bb/\u03bc)^2)\n\nBut that's the probability that all servers are busy. So the probability that at least one server is idle is 1 - P_all_busy.\n\nBut wait, the question is about the probability that both servers are idle. So that's the probability that no customers are being served and no customers are waiting in either queue.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to think about the system as a whole. Let me denote the number of customers in the system as N. In steady state, the expected value E[N] is given by the formula for M/M/2:\n\nE[N] = (\u03c1) / (1 - \u03c1^2), where \u03c1 = \u03bb/\u03bc.\n\nBut wait, that's the expected number of customers. But I need the probability that a new customer finds both registers idle, which is equivalent to the system being empty when a customer arrives.\n\nWait, but in a Poisson process, the probability that the system is empty when a customer arrives is 1/(\u03bb * t), where t is the average time between arrivals. But in this case, the system can have customers in it, so it's more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, I recall that in a M/M/n system, the probability that all n servers are idle when a customer arrives is 1/(\u03bb * \u03bc^n). But as I saw earlier, that gives a probability greater than 1, which is impossible. So perhaps I'm misapplying the formula.\n\nWait, let me check the correct formula. I think the probability that all servers are idle is 1/(\u03bb * \u03bc^n). But for n=1, that gives 1/(\u03bb * \u03bc), which is correct. For n=2, it would be 1/(\u03bb * \u03bc^2). But in our case, \u03bb=0.2, \u03bc=0.25, so 1/(0.2 * 0.0625) = 80, which is impossible. Therefore, I must be wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct formula is (\u03bc/\u03bb)^n, but that would be (0.25/0.2)^2 = (1.25)^2 = 1.5625, which is also greater than 1.\n\nWait, maybe it's (\u03bc/\u03bb)^n / (1 + (\u03bc/\u03bb)^n). Let me see:\n\nFor n=1, that would be (\u03bc/\u03bb) / (1 + \u03bc/\u03bb) = (0.25/0.2) / (1 + 0.25/0.2) = 1.25 / 1.25 = 1. That can't be right either.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me look for another approach.\n\nIn a M/M/2 system, the probability that a customer arrives and finds both servers idle can be found by considering the inter-arrival time and service times.\n\nThe probability that the time between two consecutive arrivals is greater than the sum of the service times of all customers in the system. Wait, but in this case, the customer arrives and finds both servers idle, so the time since the last arrival must be greater than the time it takes to serve all customers that arrived since the last arrival.\n\nBut since we are in steady state, the probability that a new customer finds both servers idle is equal to the exponential distribution of the inter-arrival time minus the maximum of the service times of all customers that arrived since the last arrival.\n\nWait, this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should use the formula for the probability that all servers are idle in a M/M/n system.\n\nI found that in a M/M/n system, the probability that all servers are idle is given by:\n\nP = (\u03bc^n) / (\u03bb * \u03bc^n + \u03bb^n * \u03bc)\n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, I think the probability that all servers are idle is equal to the probability that the inter-arrival time is greater than the sum of the service times of all possible customers that could have arrived during that time.\n\nBut this is tricky because the number of customers that could arrive during the inter-arrival time is a random variable.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to use the formula for the steady-state probability that all servers are busy. Then, the probability that at least one server is idle is 1 minus that. But we need the probability that both servers are idle, not just at least one.\n\nHmm, so maybe I need to calculate the probability that both servers are idle, which is the same as the system being empty when a customer arrives.\n\nWait, in a M/M/2 system, the probability that the system is empty when a customer arrives is equal to the probability that the time since the last arrival is greater than the sum of the service times of all possible customers that could have arrived in that time.\n\nBut since the number of customers that arrived since the last arrival is a Poisson variable, the probability that the inter-arrival time is greater than the maximum of the service times of all those customers.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to use the formula for the probability that all servers are idle, which is 1/(\u03bb * \u03bc^n). But as I saw earlier, that gives an impossible value. So perhaps the correct formula is different.\n\nAlternatively, I think the correct formula is the reciprocal of the sum of the squares of the service times divided by the arrival rate. Wait, I'm not sure.\n\nWait, let me think about it differently. The probability that a new customer arrives and finds both cashiers idle is equal to the exponential distribution of the inter-arrival time minus the sum of the service times of all customers that arrived since the last arrival.\n\nBut since the inter-arrival time is exponential with rate \u03bb, the probability that it's greater than some time t is e^(-\u03bb t).\n\nHowever, the time t must be greater than the sum of the service times of all customers that arrived since the last arrival.\n\nBut the number of customers that arrived since the last arrival is a Poisson random variable with mean \u03bb * t. The sum of their service times is the sum of exponential variables, which is gamma distributed with shape n and rate \u03bc.\n\nWait, this is getting too complex. Maybe I should look for a known formula.\n\nAfter some research, I found that in a M/M/n system, the probability that all servers are idle when a customer arrives is indeed 1/(\u03bb * \u03bc^n). But in our case, that gives 1/(0.2 * (0.25)^2) = 1/(0.2 * 0.0625) = 1/0.0125 = 80, which is impossible because probabilities can't exceed 1.\n\nTherefore, I must have misunderstood the formula. Maybe it's the other way around. Perhaps it's (\u03bc/\u03bb)^n, but that gives (0.25/0.2)^2 = (1.25)^2 = 1.5625, which is also greater than 1.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is (\u03bc/\u03bb)^n / (1 + (\u03bc/\u03bb)^n). Let me try that:\n\n(0.25/0.2)^2 / (1 + (0.25/0.2)^2) = (1.25)^2 / (1 + 1.5625) = 1.5625 / 2.5625 \u2248 0.608.\n\nBut I'm not sure if this is the correct approach.\n\nAlternatively, I think the correct formula for the probability that all n servers are idle is 1/(\u03bb * \u03bc^n). But as we saw, that gives 80, which is impossible. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the formula.\n\nWait, perhaps it's 1/(\u03bb * \u03bc) for n=1, which is correct, and for n=2, it's 1/(\u03bb * \u03bc^2) but normalized somehow.\n\nWait, maybe it's the probability that the inter-arrival time is greater than the sum of the service times of all customers that arrived since the last arrival. But since the number of customers is Poisson, the sum of their service times is the sum of n exponential variables, which is gamma distributed.\n\nWait, let me consider the probability that the inter-arrival time T is greater than the sum S of the service times of all customers that arrived during the inter-arrival time. Since T follows an exponential distribution with rate \u03bb, and S follows a gamma distribution with shape n and rate \u03bc.\n\nThe probability that T > S is equal to the probability that the exponential variable T is greater than the gamma variable S.\n\nBut in a M/M/n system, the probability that all servers are idle when a customer arrives is equal to the probability that T > sum_{i=1}^n S_i, where S_i are the service times of the customers that arrived during T.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to compute that.\n\nAlternatively, I found a formula that says the probability that all servers are idle is 1/(\u03bb * \u03bc^n). But again, that gives 80, which is impossible.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is (\u03bc/\u03bb)^n. Let me compute that:\n\n(\u03bc/\u03bb)^2 = (0.25/0.2)^2 = (1.25)^2 = 1.5625, which is greater than 1, so that can't be a probability.\n\nWait, maybe I need to use the formula for the steady-state probability that all servers are busy, which is:\n\nP_all_busy = (\u03c1^n) / (1 + \u03c1^n), where \u03c1 = \u03bb/\u03bc.\n\nSo, \u03c1 = 0.2 / 0.25 = 0.8.\n\nTherefore, P_all_busy = (0.8)^2 / (1 + (0.8)^2) = 0.64 / (1 + 0.64) = 0.64 / 1.64 \u2248 0.3902.\n\nSo the probability that all servers are busy is approximately 0.3902, which means the probability that at least one server is idle is 1 - 0.3902 \u2248 0.6098.\n\nBut wait, the question is about the probability that both servers are idle, not just at least one. So I need to find the probability that both servers are idle, which is different from the probability that at least one is idle.\n\nHmm, so maybe I need to calculate the probability that both servers are idle, which is equal to the probability that the system is empty when a customer arrives.\n\nIn a M/M/2 system, the probability that the system is empty when a customer arrives is equal to the reciprocal of the sum of the squares of the service times divided by the arrival rate. Wait, I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, I think the probability that both servers are idle is equal to the probability that the inter-arrival time is greater than the sum of the service times of all possible customers that could have arrived during that time.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Maybe I should use the formula for the steady-state probability that the system is empty.\n\nIn a M/M/2 system, the probability that the system is empty is equal to the probability that the inter-arrival time is greater than the sum of the service times of all customers that arrived since the last arrival.\n\nBut since the number of customers that arrived since the last arrival is Poisson, the sum of their service times is a gamma distribution.\n\nWait, maybe I can use the formula for the probability that the system is empty, which is:\n\nP_empty = 1/(\u03bb * \u03bc^2)\n\nBut again, that gives 1/(0.2 * 0.0625) = 80, which is impossible.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is (\u03bc/\u03bb)^2. So (0.25/0.2)^2 = (1.25)^2 = 1.5625, which is still greater than 1.\n\nWait, I'm stuck here. Maybe I should try to compute it using the formula for the steady-state probability that the system is empty.\n\nIn a M/M/2 system, the probability that the system is empty when a customer arrives is equal to the probability that the inter-arrival time is greater than the sum of the service times of all customers that arrived since the last arrival.\n\nLet me denote T as the inter-arrival time, which is exponential with rate \u03bb. Let S be the sum of the service times of all customers that arrived during T.\n\nSince the number of customers that arrived during T is Poisson with mean \u03bb*T, the sum S is the sum of n exponential variables, which is gamma distributed with shape n and rate \u03bc.\n\nThe probability that T > S is equal to the probability that the exponential variable T is greater than the gamma variable S.\n\nBut I need to compute P(T > S).\n\nSince T and S are dependent variables, this is not straightforward. However, I think there is a known result for this.\n\nIn a M/M/n system, the probability that the inter-arrival time is greater than the sum of the service times of all customers that arrived during that time is equal to 1/(\u03bb * \u03bc^n).\n\nBut as before, that gives 1/(0.2 * 0.0625) = 80, which is impossible.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the fact that the sum S is the maximum of the service times, not the sum. Because if a customer arrives and finds both servers idle, that means that the time since the last arrival is greater than the maximum service time of any customer that arrived since then.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. The customer arrives and joins the shortest queue, but if both queues are empty, they just start serving.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should think about the system as being in a state where both servers are idle. The probability of being in that state when a customer arrives is equal to the probability that the inter-arrival time is greater than the time it takes to serve all customers that arrived since the last arrival.\n\nBut I'm not making progress here.

Each cashier takes an average of 4 minutes to serve a customer, and service times follow an exponential distribution. At a random point in the day during steady-state operation, what is the probability that a newly arriving customer will find both cashiers idle (no customers waiting in line or being served)? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this problem about a small shop with two cashiers. The customers arrive randomly according to a Poisson process, with an average of 12 customers per hour. When a customer arrives, they join the shortest queue. If both queues are the same length, they choose randomly. Each cashier takes an average of 4 minutes to serve a customer, and the service times follow an exponential distribution. The question is asking for the probability that a newly arriving customer will find both cashiers idle, meaning no customers waiting in line or being served.\n\nHmm, okay. Let's break this down. So, we have two cashiers, each with their own queue. Customers arrive at a Poisson rate, which is a continuous process with exponential inter-arrival times. Each service time is also exponential with a mean of 4 minutes. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out the steady-state probabilities. Since the shop is in steady-state operation, the system is in a balanced state where the arrival rate equals the service rate. \n\nLet me denote the arrival rate as \u03bb, which is 12 customers per hour. But I should convert that to per minute for consistency with the service rate, which is in minutes. So, 12 customers per hour is 0.2 customers per minute. \n\nWait, actually, no. If the average service time is 4 minutes per customer, that means the service rate \u03bc is 1/4 customers per minute. So, \u03bc = 1/4 per minute. \n\nBut the arrival rate \u03bb is 12 per hour, which is 12/60 = 0.2 per minute. So, \u03bb = 0.2 per minute.\n\nSince the system is in steady-state, the arrival rate should equal the total service rate. Let me check that. The total service rate is 2\u03bc, because there are two cashiers. So, 2 * (1/4) = 0.5 customers per minute. \n\nBut the arrival rate is 0.2 per minute, which is less than 0.5. Hmm, that seems odd. Wait, no, actually, the arrival rate is the number of customers arriving each minute, and the service rate is the number being served each minute. So, if the arrival rate is 0.2 and the service rate is 0.5, the system can handle more customers than are arriving, which is fine. It just means the queues will not be constantly full.\n\nBut wait, the question is about the probability that a new customer arrives and finds both cashiers idle. So, that would mean that at the time of arrival, both cashiers are not serving anyone and have no one waiting in line.\n\nTo model this, I think I need to consider the system as a Markov chain with states representing the number of customers in each queue. Since the shop has two cashiers, the number of customers in each queue can be 0, 1, or 2, but since the total number of customers is Poisson, the number in each queue can be thought of as being in a Poisson distribution.\n\nWait, but the customers are assigned to the shortest queue, which complicates things. So, when a customer arrives, they join the shorter queue. If both queues are equal, they choose randomly. So, the system doesn't have a fixed structure; the queues can change dynamically as customers arrive and are served.\n\nThis seems a bit tricky. Maybe I can model the system using the concept of M/M/2 queues, but with the added complexity of customers choosing the shorter queue. Alternatively, perhaps I can model the system as two independent M/M/1 queues, but that's not exactly accurate because customers can choose between them based on the current length.\n\nWait, another approach could be to consider the system as a single server with two queues. Since customers always join the shorter queue, the system can be thought of as a single queue where the service rate is effectively doubled because each cashier can handle a customer simultaneously.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the right way to model it. Maybe I should think in terms of the state of the system as the number of customers in each queue. Let's denote the state as (n1, n2), where n1 and n2 are the number of customers in each queue. However, since customers are always joining the shorter queue, the system will tend towards balance.\n\nBut since the arrival rate is 0.2 and the service rate is 0.5, the system is actually more capable of handling customers than it's being taxed with. So, the queues might not be very long on average.\n\nWait, but the question is about the probability that both cashiers are idle when a new customer arrives. That is, the probability that when a customer arrives, both queues have zero customers in them, and neither cashier is serving anyone.\n\nSo, perhaps I can model the system as two independent M/M/1 queues, each with service rate \u03bc = 1/4 per minute. The arrival rate for each queue would be \u03bb1 and \u03bb2, but since customers choose the shorter queue, the actual arrival rate to each queue is less than \u03bb.\n\nWait, but since customers choose the shorter queue, the arrival rate to each queue is actually half of the total arrival rate, because each customer chooses one of the two queues. So, each queue would have an arrival rate of \u03bb/2 = 0.1 per minute.\n\nBut wait, that might not be correct because the assignment is dynamic based on the current queue lengths. So, the arrival rate to each queue isn't necessarily fixed.\n\nHmm, maybe I should consider the system as a single M/M/2 queue, but with the service rate doubled. So, the total service rate is 2\u03bc, and the arrival rate is \u03bb. Then, the probability that both servers are idle can be found using the formula for M/M/n queues.\n\nWait, I think I remember that in an M/M/n queue, the probability that all n servers are idle is given by the formula:\n\nP(0) = (\u03bb/(\u03bcn))^n / (1 + (\u03bb/(\u03bcn))^n)\n\nBut wait, that seems off. Let me think again.\n\nActually, for an M/M/n queue, the probability that all servers are idle is:\n\nP(0) = (\u03bc/\u03bb)^n\n\nBut only if \u03bb < n\u03bc. Otherwise, P(0) = 0.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right either. Let me check.\n\nI think the correct formula is:\n\nP(0) = (\u03bc/\u03bb)^n / (1 + (\u03bc/\u03bb)^n)\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe I should derive it.\n\nIn an M/M/n queue, the steady-state probability that all servers are idle is:\n\nP(0) = (\u03bc/\u03bb)^n / (1 + (\u03bc/\u03bb)^n)\n\nYes, that seems familiar. So, in our case, we have n=2 servers, each with service rate \u03bc=1/4 per minute, and arrival rate \u03bb=0.2 per minute.\n\nWait, but hold on. In this problem, the customers are choosing the shorter queue, which might not be exactly the same as an M/M/2 queue where all arrivals go to the first server. So, perhaps the formula doesn't apply directly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model the system as two independent M/M/1 queues, each with half the arrival rate. So, each queue would have \u03bb' = \u03bb/2 = 0.1 per minute.\n\nThen, the probability that both queues are empty when a new customer arrives would be the product of the probabilities that each queue is empty.\n\nBut wait, that's not correct because the queues are not independent. When a customer arrives, they choose the shorter queue, so the queues are dependent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model the system as a single M/M/2 queue, where each customer chooses the shortest queue, but in terms of the system's behavior, it's equivalent to two servers each with half the arrival rate.\n\nSo, if I treat it as a single M/M/2 queue, then the probability that both servers are idle is:\n\nP(0) = (\u03bc/\u03bb)^2 / (1 + (\u03bc/\u03bb)^2)\n\nPlugging in the numbers: \u03bc = 1/4 per minute, \u03bb = 0.2 per minute.\n\nFirst, compute \u03bc/\u03bb: (1/4)/0.2 = (0.25)/0.2 = 1.25.\n\nThen, (\u03bc/\u03bb)^2 = (1.25)^2 = 1.5625.\n\nSo, P(0) = 1.5625 / (1 + 1.5625) = 1.5625 / 2.5625 \u2248 0.60875.\n\nBut wait, that can't be right because if the arrival rate is less than the total service rate, the probability should be higher than that.\n\nWait, maybe I'm mixing up the formula. Let me think again.\n\nActually, the formula for the probability that all n servers are idle in an M/M/n queue is:\n\nP(0) = (\u03bc/\u03bb)^n / (1 + (\u03bc/\u03bb)^n)\n\nBut only when \u03bc/\u03bb < 1. Otherwise, if \u03bc/\u03bb \u2265 1, P(0)=0.\n\nWait, but in our case, \u03bc = 1/4 per minute, \u03bb = 0.2 per minute, so \u03bc/\u03bb = (1/4)/0.2 = 1.25, which is greater than 1. So, that formula would give P(0)=0, which contradicts my earlier result.\n\nHmm, clearly, I'm getting confused here. Let me try a different approach.\n\nPerhaps I should model the system as two independent M/M/1 queues, each with service rate \u03bc = 1/4 per minute, and arrival rate \u03bb/2 = 0.1 per minute. Then, the probability that a new customer arrives and finds both queues empty is the probability that both queues are empty, which would be the product of the individual probabilities.\n\nWait, but that's not correct because the queues are not independent. When a customer arrives, they choose the shorter queue, so the queues are dependent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the system as a single server with two possible states: either the first cashier is idle or busy, and the second similarly. But this might complicate things.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think in terms of the system's state as the number of customers in each queue. Since customers always join the shorter queue, the system will try to balance the queues. However, since the service times are exponential, the time until the next service completion is memoryless.\n\nLet me consider the state of the system as (n1, n2), where n1 and n2 are the number of customers in each queue. The system starts at some state, and upon arrival, the customer chooses the shorter queue.\n\nBut this might be too complex to model directly because the state space is infinite. However, since the arrival rate is low relative to the total service rate, the average number of customers in each queue is likely to be small, so maybe I can approximate the system with a finite state space.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the concept of Little's Law, which states that the average number of customers in the system is equal to the average number of arrivals per unit time divided by the service rate per unit time.\n\nSo, the average number of customers in the system, L, is L = \u03bb / \u03bc_total. Here, \u03bc_total = 2\u03bc = 0.5 per minute. So, L = 0.2 / 0.5 = 0.4 customers.\n\nSo, on average, there are 0.4 customers in the system at any time.\n\nBut the question is about the probability that both cashiers are idle when a customer arrives. So, that would mean that the system is empty when the customer arrives.\n\nBut wait, the system isn't necessarily empty; it could have customers being served. So, the probability that both cashiers are idle is the probability that there are no customers in the system when the customer arrives.\n\nWait, no. Because the customer arrives and joins the shortest queue, but if both cashiers are idle, the customer just starts being served immediately. So, the probability that both cashiers are idle is the same as the probability that the system is empty when the customer arrives.\n\nBut in Poisson process terms, the time between arrivals is exponential, so the probability that the system is empty when a customer arrives is equal to the probability that the last customer was served before the arrival time.\n\nHmm, I'm getting a bit tangled here.\n\nWait, perhaps I can model the system as a single M/M/2 queue, where each arrival chooses the shorter queue. Then, the probability that both servers are idle is the same as the probability that the system is empty when a customer arrives.\n\nIn an M/M/2 queue, the probability that all servers are idle is indeed (\u03bc/\u03bb)^2 / (1 + (\u03bc/\u03bb)^2), but only when \u03bc/\u03bb < 1. However, in our case, \u03bc/\u03bb = 1.25 > 1, which would make P(0) = 0, which can't be right.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the formula. Let me look it up.\n\nUpon reflection, I recall that in an M/M/n queue, the probability that all n servers are idle is given by:\n\nP(0) = (\u03bc/\u03bb)^n / (1 + (\u03bc/\u03bb)^n)\n\nBut only when \u03bc/\u03bb < 1. If \u03bc/\u03bb \u2265 1, then P(0)=0 because the system is saturated.\n\nWait, but in our case, \u03bc/\u03bb = (1/4)/0.2 = 1.25 > 1, so P(0)=0. But that can't be correct because the system isn't saturated; it's underutilized.\n\nI think I'm confusing the formula. Let me think again.\n\nActually, the correct formula for the steady-state probability that all n servers are busy in an M/M/n queue is:\n\nP(all busy) = 1 - (\u03bc/\u03bb)^n / (1 + (\u03bc/\u03bb)^n)\n\nBut that's not the same as P(0). Hmm.\n\nWait, I think I need to derive it properly.\n\nIn an M/M/n queue, the steady-state probability that all n servers are idle is:\n\nP(0) = (\u03bc/\u03bb)^n / (1 + (\u03bc/\u03bb)^n)\n\nBut this is only valid when \u03bb < n\u03bc. If \u03bb \u2265 n\u03bc, then P(0)=0.\n\nIn our case, n=2, \u03bc=0.25, \u03bb=0.2.\n\nSo, \u03bc/\u03bb = 0.25/0.2 = 1.25 > 1, which means \u03bb > \u03bc. Wait, no, \u03bc is per server, so total \u03bc is 0.5, and \u03bb is 0.2. So, \u03bb < \u03bc_total, meaning the system is not saturated.\n\nSo, perhaps the formula still applies. Let me compute it.\n\n(\u03bc/\u03bb)^2 = (1.25)^2 = 1.5625\n\nSo, P(0) = 1.5625 / (1 + 1.5625) = 1.5625 / 2.5625 \u2248 0.60875\n\nBut this seems high. Intuitively, if the system isn't saturated, the probability that both servers are idle should be higher. Wait, but if the arrival rate is less than the total service rate, the system can handle more customers, so the probability of both being idle should be higher than 0.6.\n\nWait, but according to the formula, it's about 0.60875, which is about 60.875%. That seems plausible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the probability that both servers are busy is 1 - P(0) = 1 - 0.60875 = 0.39125.\n\nBut let's see if this makes sense. Since the arrival rate is 0.2, and the total service rate is 0.5, the system can handle more customers, so the probability of both being idle should be higher than if the system were saturated.\n\nWait, another way to think about it is that the system is underutilized, so the probability of both being idle is higher.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model the system as two independent M/M/1 queues, each with \u03bb'=0.1 per minute. Then, the probability that a customer arrives and finds both queues empty would be the product of the individual probabilities.\n\nBut that's not correct because the queues are not independent; a customer chooses the shorter queue, so the queues are dependent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the system as a single M/M/2 queue, and use the formula for P(0) as (\u03bc/\u03bb)^2 / (1 + (\u03bc/\u03bb)^2) \u2248 0.60875.\n\nBut wait, let me verify this formula.\n\nUpon checking, the correct formula for the probability that all n servers are idle in an M/M/n queue is indeed:\n\nP(0) = (\u03bc/\u03bb)^n / (1 + (\u03bc/\u03bb)^n)\n\nBut this is only valid when \u03bb < n\u03bc. If \u03bb \u2265 n\u03bc, then P(0) = 0.\n\nIn our case, n=2, \u03bc=0.25, \u03bb=0.2.\n\nSo, \u03bc/\u03bb = 0.25 / 0.2 = 1.25.\n\nSince \u03bc/\u03bb > 1, which is equivalent to \u03bb > \u03bc (since \u03bc is per server), but total \u03bc is 0.5, and \u03bb=0.2 < 0.5, so the system is not saturated, meaning \u03bb < \u03bc_total.\n\nWait, but the formula is for when \u03bb < n\u03bc. In our case, n=2, so n\u03bc = 0.5, and \u03bb=0.2 < 0.5, so the formula applies.\n\nTherefore, P(0) = (1.25)^2 / (1 + (1.25)^2) = 1.5625 / (1 + 1.5625) = 1.5625 / 2.5625 \u2248 0.60875.\n\nSo, approximately 60.875% chance that both cashiers are idle when a new customer arrives.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. If the system is underutilized, meaning that the arrival rate is less than the total service rate, then the probability of both servers being idle should be higher than if the system were saturated.\n\nBut according to this formula, it's about 60.875%, which seems reasonable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model the system as two independent M/M/1 queues, each with service rate \u03bc and arrival rate \u03bb/2.\n\nThen, the probability that a new customer arrives and finds both queues empty is the probability that both queues are empty, which would be the product of the individual probabilities.\n\nBut since the queues are dependent, this approach might not be accurate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the probability that all servers are idle in an M/M/2 queue, which is indeed the formula I used earlier.\n\nTherefore, the probability that a new customer arrives and finds both cashiers idle is approximately 0.60875, or 60.875%.\n\nBut let me check if this makes sense with another approach.\n\nConsider that the time between"

    "solution": "Solve this problem step by step. End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: A small shop has two cashiers working at different registers. Customers arrive at random according to a Poisson process with an average of 12 customers per hour. Upon arrival, a customer joins the shortest queue (if both queues are the same length, they choose randomly). Each cashier takes an average of 4 minutes to serve a customer, and service times follow an exponential distribution. At a random point in the day during steady-state operation, what is the probability that a newly arriving customer will find both cashiers idle (no customers waiting in line or being served)? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem about a small shop with two cashiers. Customers arrive randomly according to a Poisson process, averaging 12 customers per hour. When a customer arrives, they join the shortest queue. If both queues are the same length, they choose randomly. Each cashier takes an average of 4 minutes to serve a customer, and the service times follow an exponential distribution. I need to find the probability that a newly arriving customer will find both cashiers idle, meaning no one is waiting in line or being served at that moment.\n\nHmm, let me start by understanding the problem. So, we have two cashiers, each with their own queue. Customers arrive randomly, and they choose the shorter queue. If both are equal, they choose randomly. Each cashier serves customers with an exponential distribution, meaning the time taken is memoryless. The average service time is 4 minutes, so the rate \u03bb for each cashier is 1/4 customers per minute.\n\nWait, actually, the arrival rate is 12 customers per hour, which is 0.2 customers per minute. But each cashier serves customers at a rate of 1/4 per minute. So the system has two cashiers each handling customers at 0.25 per minute, and customers arrive at 0.2 per minute.\n\nI think I need to model this as a system with two queues, each served by an M/M/1 queue. Since the service times are exponential, it's an M/M/1 queue for each cashier. The arrival is Poisson, so it's an M/M/2/2 system? Wait, no, because the arrival is to the entire system, but customers choose the shorter queue.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to model the entire system as a M/M/2/2 system, but with customers choosing the shorter queue. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a M/M/2/\u221e system, but in this case, since the customers are choosing the shorter queue, it's more like a M/M/2/2 system.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to model the queues as two separate M/M/1 queues, each with service rate 0.25 per minute, and arrival rate 0.2 per minute. But since customers choose the shorter queue, the arrival rate to each queue is not 0.2 per minute but depends on the current state.\n\nWait, this seems complicated. Maybe I can think of it as a system where the arrival rate to each queue is half of the total arrival rate, but that might not be accurate because customers always go to the shorter queue. If both queues are equal, they choose randomly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the system is equivalent to each cashier being served by a Poisson process with rate 0.2 per minute, but with the possibility of customers being in both queues.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about the steady-state distribution of the number of customers in each queue.\n\nLet me denote the number of customers in queue 1 as N1 and in queue 2 as N2. Since the system is in steady-state, the arrival rate must equal the service rate for each queue.\n\nBut wait, each customer that arrives chooses the shorter queue. So the arrival rate to each queue depends on the current state. Hmm, this is getting tricky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model the system as a single M/M/2/2 queue, but with customers choosing the shorter queue, so the effective service rate for each customer is the same as the other. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another approach: Since each customer chooses the shorter queue, the system can be considered as a single queue with two servers, where each server can be thought of as having a service rate of 0.25 per minute. But since customers always go to the shorter queue, the overall system behaves like a M/M/2/2 queue.\n\nWait, but in a M/M/2/2 queue, each server has a service rate of 0.25, and the arrival rate is 0.2. So the steady-state probability that the system is empty, or that both servers are idle, is the probability that an arriving customer finds both servers idle.\n\nIn a M/M/2/2 queue, the probability that the system is empty is \u03bb/(\u03bb + 2\u03bc), where \u03bb is the arrival rate and \u03bc is the service rate. Wait, but that's for M/M/1/1. No, wait, maybe it's different.\n\nWait, in M/M/s/n systems, the probability that all servers are idle is given by certain formulas. For M/M/2/2, the probability that all servers are idle is (2\u03bc)^2 / (\u03bb + 2\u03bc)^2. Let me check that.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't sound right. Let me recall the formula for the steady-state probability that all servers are busy in an M/M/s/n system. The probability that all s servers are busy is (s!) (\u03bb^s) / ( (\u03bb + n\u03bc)^n ). But wait, that might not be directly applicable here.\n\nAlternatively, the probability that a new customer finds all servers busy is given by the formula for the M/M/s system. For M/M/2/2, the probability that both servers are busy is [ (\u03bb^2) / ( (\u03bb + 2\u03bc)^2 ) ] * (2)/(2 + 1) ), but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think differently. The probability that a new customer finds both queues empty is the same as the probability that both cashiers are idle. So, in steady-state, the probability that both cashiers are idle is equal to the ratio of the service rates over the total service rate.\n\nWait, for M/M/2/2, the probability that both servers are idle is (\u03bc1 \u03bc2) / (\u03bc1 + \u03bc2 + \u03bb). But in this case, \u03bc1 = \u03bc2 = 0.25 per minute, and \u03bb = 0.2 per minute. So the probability would be (0.25 * 0.25) / (0.25 + 0.25 + 0.2) = (0.0625) / (0.7) \u2248 0.08928.\n\nBut wait, that seems low. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is different. Let me think again.\n\nIn a M/M/2/2 system, the steady-state probability that all servers are idle is (\u03bc1 \u03bc2) / (\u03bc1 + \u03bc2 + \u03bb). But wait, that doesn't seem right because the denominator should be the total service rate plus arrival rate. Wait, no, the total service rate is \u03bc1 + \u03bc2, and arrival rate is \u03bb. So the probability that both servers are idle is (\u03bc1 \u03bc2) / (\u03bc1 + \u03bc2 + \u03bb).\n\nWait, but that would be (0.25 * 0.25) / (0.25 + 0.25 + 0.2) = 0.0625 / 0.7 \u2248 0.08928, which is about 8.928%.\n\nBut I'm not sure if this is the correct approach because the customers are choosing the shorter queue. So perhaps the system is not exactly M/M/2/2, but more like a system where each server has a service rate of 0.25, and the arrival rate is split between them based on the current queue lengths.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to model the system as two independent M/M/1 queues, but with customers choosing the shorter one. So the arrival rate to each queue is not fixed but depends on the current state.\n\nWait, perhaps the system can be considered as a M/M/2/2 queue where each customer is assigned to one of the two servers with equal probability when the queues are equal. So the effective service rate for each server is 0.25, and the arrival rate is 0.2.\n\nIn that case, the probability that both servers are idle is given by the formula for M/M/2/2:\n\nP(both idle) = (\u03bc1 \u03bc2) / (\u03bc1 + \u03bc2 + \u03bb)\n\nBut since \u03bc1 = \u03bc2 = 0.25, and \u03bb = 0.2,\n\nP = (0.25 * 0.25) / (0.25 + 0.25 + 0.2) = 0.0625 / 0.7 \u2248 0.08928.\n\nSo approximately 8.928% chance.\n\nWait, but I'm not entirely confident about this formula. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, the probability that both cashiers are idle is the same as the probability that the system is empty, which in an M/M/2/2 system is given by:\n\nP(0) = (\u03bb^0) / ( (\u03bb + 2\u03bc)^2 )\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because for M/M/1/1, P(0) = (\u03bc1 \u03bc2) / (\u03bc1 + \u03bc2 + \u03bb). But that's when both servers are operational.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the generating function or the steady-state equations.\n\nLet me denote the steady-state probability that both queues are empty as P. Then, the rate at which customers arrive when both queues are empty is \u03bb, and each customer will go to one of the two queues. So the expected number of customers leaving the system per minute is 2\u03bc, because each server can serve at 0.25 per minute, so together 0.5 per minute. But the arrival rate is \u03bb = 0.2 per minute.\n\nWait, that suggests that the system is unstable because the arrival rate is higher than the total service rate. Wait, 0.2 per minute arrival, total service rate is 0.5 per minute, so actually the system is stable.\n\nWait, no, because in reality, the customers are choosing the shorter queue, so the effective service rate might be different.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the system as a single M/M/2/2 queue with two servers each having rate \u03bc = 0.25, and arrival rate \u03bb = 0.2. Then, the steady-state probability that both servers are idle is (\u03bc1 \u03bc2) / (\u03bc1 + \u03bc2 + \u03bb). So that would be (0.25 * 0.25) / (0.25 + 0.25 + 0.2) = 0.0625 / 0.7 \u2248 0.08928.\n\nBut I'm not sure if this is correct because the customers are choosing the shorter queue, which might affect the distribution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the probability that both queues are empty is the same as the probability that the system is empty, which is \u03bb / (\u03bb + 2\u03bc). Wait, that would be 0.2 / (0.2 + 0.5) = 0.2 / 0.7 \u2248 0.2857. But that seems higher.\n\nWait, but in M/M/1/1, the probability that the system is empty is \u03bc / (\u03bb + \u03bc). But that's for a single server.\n\nWait, perhaps for two servers, it's different. Let me look for a formula for M/M/2/2 systems.\n\nAfter some thinking, I recall that in an M/M/2/2 system, the steady-state probability that all servers are idle is (\u03bc1 \u03bc2) / (\u03bc1 + \u03bc2 + \u03bb). So plugging in the numbers, that's (0.25 * 0.25) / (0.25 + 0.25 + 0.2) = 0.0625 / 0.7 \u2248 0.08928.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: The probability that both cashiers are idle is equal to the probability that the system is empty, which in a M/M/2/2 system is given by (\u03bb^0) / ( (\u03bb + 2\u03bc)^2 ). Wait, that can't be right because that would be 1 / (0.2 + 0.5)^2 \u2248 1 / (0.7)^2 \u2248 0.310.\n\nBut that contradicts the previous result. So I'm confused.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the formula for the generating function. Let me denote the generating function for the number of customers in the system as G(s). For a M/M/2/2 system, the generating function satisfies:\n\nG(s) = (\u03bb s) / (s (\u03bc + s) - \u03bb s)\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, the generating function for M/M/s/n is G(s) = (\u03bb s) / (s (\u03bc + s)^n - \u03bb s).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to use the formula for the probability that all servers are idle, which is (\u03bc1 \u03bc2) / (\u03bc1 + \u03bc2 + \u03bb). So in this case, (0.25 * 0.25) / (0.25 + 0.25 + 0.2) = 0.0625 / 0.7 \u2248 0.08928.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that the expected number of idle cashiers is 2 * (\u03bc / (\u03bb + \u03bc)). But that's for each cashier, the probability that they are idle is \u03bc / (\u03bb + \u03bc), so for two cashiers, it would be 2 * (0.25 / (0.2 + 0.25)) = 2 * (0.25 / 0.45) \u2248 1.111. But the probability that both are idle is not the sum of their individual probabilities, because they are dependent.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the formula for the joint probability that both are idle. Let me consider that the probability that both are idle is equal to the probability that the system is empty, which in M/M/2/2 is (\u03bb^0) / ( (\u03bb + 2\u03bc)^2 ). But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe I should think in terms of the rate at which customers arrive when both queues are empty. When both queues are empty, the first customer arrives and joins one of the queues. Then, the next customer will also join the shorter queue, and so on.\n\nBut this seems too vague. Maybe I can use the formula for the probability that the system is empty in a M/M/2/2 system, which is (\u03bc1 \u03bc2) / (\u03bc1 + \u03bc2 + \u03bb). So that would be (0.25 * 0.25) / (0.25 + 0.25 + 0.2) = 0.0625 / 0.7 \u2248 0.08928.\n\nAlternatively, I think I might have confused the formula. Let me check.\n\nUpon checking, for an M/M/s/n system, the steady-state probability that all s servers are idle is (s \u03bc^s) / ( (s \u03bc + \u03bb)^s ). But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again.\n\nAnother approach: Let me denote the probability that both queues are empty as P. When the system is empty, the next customer arrives and joins one of the two queues. The rate at which customers leave the system is 2\u03bc, since each server can serve at 0.25 per minute. The arrival rate is \u03bb, so in steady-state, the rate in must equal the rate out.\n\nSo, the rate out is 2\u03bc, and the rate in is \u03bb. So 2\u03bc = \u03bb + P * 0, because when the system is empty, the next customer arrives and starts a service, so the rate in is \u03bb, and the rate out is 2\u03bc. Therefore, 2\u03bc = \u03bb + 0, but that can't be right because that would imply P=0.\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because when the system is empty, the next customer arrives and starts a service, so the system becomes non-empty. So the rate in is \u03bb, and the rate out is 2\u03bc. Therefore, in steady-state, 2\u03bc = \u03bb + (probability that the system is empty) * 0, which would imply P=0, which can't be right.\n\nWait, that suggests that the system cannot be empty in steady-state, which is not true because sometimes both cashiers are idle.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model the system as having two possible states: both cashiers idle, or one or both cashiers busy.\n\nLet me denote P as the probability that both cashiers are idle. Then, the rate at which customers arrive when both are idle is \u03bb, and they will choose one of the two queues, say queue 1, with probability 1/2 if they are equal, but when both are idle, the next customer will go to one queue, making it length 1, and the other queue remains 0.\n\nWait, no, when both queues are empty, the next customer will choose one of the two queues with equal probability, say queue 1, then queue 1 has 1 customer, queue 2 has 0. Then, the next customer will choose the shorter queue, which is queue 2 (since queue 1 has 1 and queue 2 has 0). Wait, no, queue 2 is empty, so the next customer would go to queue 2, making it 1, and queue 1 remains 0.\n\nWait, this seems complicated. Maybe it's better to use the formula for the M/M/2/2 system.\n\nUpon further research, I find that in an M/M/2/2 system, the probability that all servers are idle is (\u03bc1 \u03bc2) / (\u03bc1 + \u03bc2 + \u03bb). So plugging in the values, \u03bc1 = \u03bc2 = 0.25, \u03bb = 0.2.\n\nSo P = (0.25 * 0.25) / (0.25 + 0.25 + 0.2) = 0.0625 / 0.7 \u2248 0.08928.\n\nTherefore, the probability is approximately 8.928%.\n\nBut wait, I'm not entirely confident because I'm not sure if this formula applies here. Maybe I should think differently.\n\nAlternatively, consider that each cashier can be in one of two states: busy or idle. The probability that a cashier is idle is \u03bc / (\u03bb + \u03bc), which for each cashier is 0.25 / (0.2 + 0.25) = 0.25 / 0.45 \u2248 0.5556.\n\nBut the probability that both are idle is not just the product of their individual probabilities because they are dependent. So perhaps I need to use the joint probability.\n\nWait, in a M/M/2/2 system, the joint probability that both are idle is indeed (\u03bc1 \u03bc2) / (\u03bc1 + \u03bc2 + \u03bb). So that's 0.08928.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that the expected number of idle cashiers is 2 * (\u03bc / (\u03bb + \u03bc)) = 2*(0.25 / 0.45) \u2248 1.111. But the probability that both are idle is not just (1.111)^2, because that would overcount.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is (\u03bc1 \u03bc2) / (\u03bc1 + \u03bc2 + \u03bb), which gives 0.08928.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of the"

    "solution": "Solve this problem step by step. End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: A small shop has two cashiers working at different registers. Customers arrive at random according to a Poisson process with an average of 12 customers per hour. Upon arrival, a customer joins the shortest queue (if both queues are the same length, they choose randomly). Each cashier takes an average of 4 minutes to serve a customer, and service times follow an exponential distribution. At a random point in the day during steady-state operation, what is the probability that a newly arriving customer will find both cashiers idle (no customers waiting in line or being served)? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this problem about a small shop with two cashiers. Customers arrive randomly according to a Poisson process, averaging 12 customers per hour. Each customer joins the shortest queue; if both queues are equal, they choose randomly. Each cashier takes an average of 4 minutes to serve a customer, and service times follow an exponential distribution. I need to find the probability that a newly arriving customer will find both cashiers idle, meaning no one is waiting in line or being served.\n\nOkay, let's break this down. I remember that in queueing theory, when dealing with Poisson arrivals and exponential service times, we often model the system using M/M/s queues or something similar. But in this case, there are two cashiers, so it's a M/M/2 system, maybe? Or is it something else because customers choose the shortest queue?\n\nWait, the customers choose the shortest queue, which complicates things because it's not just a simple M/M/2 queue. In a standard M/M/s queue, customers go to the first available server, which might not be the shortest. So maybe I need a different approach.\n\nI recall that when customers choose the shortest queue, the system can be modeled as a M/M/2 queue with an additional mechanism to ensure that the shortest queue is selected. But I'm not entirely sure if that's the right model here. Alternatively, maybe I should think about the system as a two-server system where each server can have a queue, and customers always join the one with fewer customers, or if equal, choose randomly.\n\nIn steady-state, I need to find the probability that when a customer arrives, both servers are idle. That is, both cashiers are not serving anyone, and their queues are empty.\n\nHmm, so I think the key here is to find the state of the system where both cashiers are idle. In other words, the system is empty. But wait, no, because customers arrive continuously, so the system is in a steady state with some expected number of customers in each queue.\n\nWait, but the question is about the probability that a newly arriving customer finds both cashiers idle. So when a customer arrives, they look at both queues. If both queues are empty, they join one of them (randomly, since both are empty). If one queue is non-empty, they join the shorter one. If both queues have the same number of customers, they choose randomly.\n\nBut the question is specifically about the probability that both cashiers are idle when a customer arrives. So that would mean that both queues are empty, right? Because if one queue is not empty, the customer would join the other queue, but if both are empty, they join one, but the point is that both are idle.\n\nWait, actually, when the customer arrives, if both queues are empty, then both cashiers are idle. If one queue is non-empty, the customer joins the other queue, which might have someone being served. So the probability we're looking for is the probability that when a customer arrives, both queues are empty.\n\nSo, to find that probability, I need to model the system and find the probability that both queues are empty at the time of arrival.\n\nI think I can model this as a Markov chain where the state is the number of customers in each queue. Since customers choose the shortest queue, the system will have certain steady-state probabilities.\n\nLet me denote the number of customers in the first queue as i and in the second queue as j. The state is (i,j). Since customers always join the shorter queue, the process is somewhat similar to a M/M/2 queue, but with the additional rule of choosing the shortest.\n\nWait, actually, in the standard M/M/s model, customers go to the first available server, which might not necessarily be the shortest. So in our case, since customers choose the shortest queue, the system might behave differently.\n\nI think in such a system, the queues can never have more than one customer, because if one queue has two customers, the next customer would choose the other queue, which is shorter. Wait, no, that's not necessarily true. Suppose both queues have one customer, the next customer would choose randomly between the two, but if one queue has two and the other has one, the customer would go to the one with one.\n\nWait, maybe the queues can't have more than one customer each because of the way customers choose. Let me think.\n\nSuppose we have two queues. If one queue has two customers and the other has one, the next customer will go to the queue with one customer, making it two. Then, if another customer arrives, they will go to the other queue, making it one again. So it's like they alternate between having one and two customers.\n\nBut wait, if a queue has two customers, and another customer arrives, they'll go to the shorter one, which is one, making it two again. So actually, the queues can have two customers each, but the system might oscillate between states.\n\nWait, no, because if one queue has two and the other has one, the next customer goes to the one with one, making it two. Then, the next customer goes to the other queue, which has one (since the first two have been served by their cashier). So it's possible to have a state where both queues have one customer each, or one queue has two and the other has one, or both queues are empty.\n\nWait, but in the case where one queue has two and the other has one, the next customer will go to the one with one, making it two. Then, the next customer goes to the other queue, which has one (since the first two were being served). So the queues can have two customers, but only in a way that they alternate.\n\nBut actually, in the standard M/M/2 model, the maximum number of customers in a queue is two because of the way customers choose the shortest queue. So maybe in this case, the system can only have states where the total number of customers is 0, 1, or 2.\n\nWait, let's think about it. If both queues are empty, the next customer goes to one, making it one. Then, another customer arrives, they go to the other queue, making it one. Then, another customer arrives, they go to one of the two queues with one customer each, choosing randomly. So after that, one queue will have two and the other will have one. Then, the next customer goes to the shorter one, which is one, making it two. Then, the next customer goes to the other one, which has one, making it two. Wait, this seems to create a state where both queues have two customers, which can't be right because that would mean four customers in total, but with two cashiers.\n\nWait, no, because each cashier can only serve one customer at a time. So if both queues have two customers, that would mean each cashier is serving two customers simultaneously, which isn't possible because they can only handle one at a time. So actually, the system can't have both queues with two customers each because that would imply both cashiers are serving two customers, which isn't possible.\n\nSo perhaps the maximum number of customers in the system is two, with one in each queue. Let me try to model the states.\n\nPossible states:\n\n1. (0,0): Both queues empty.\n2. (1,0) and (0,1): One queue has one, the other has none.\n3. (1,1): Both queues have one.\n\nIs that it? Because if we have (2,0), the next customer would go to the other queue, making it (1,1). Then, the next customer would go to one of the two queues with one, making it (2,1) or (1,2). But wait, can we have (2,1)?\n\nWait, if we have (1,1), the next customer goes to one, making it (2,1). Then, the next customer goes to the shorter queue, which is the one with one, making it (1,2). Then, the next customer goes to the shorter one, which is the one with one, making it (2,2). But that would mean both queues have two customers each, which is impossible because each cashier can only serve one customer at a time. So actually, (2,2) can't happen because it would require both cashiers to be serving two customers simultaneously, which isn't possible.\n\nTherefore, the system cannot have both queues with two customers each. So the states are:\n\n- (0,0)\n- (1,0) and (0,1)\n- (1,1)\n\nAdditionally, when a customer arrives in a state like (1,0), they go to the other queue, making it (0,1). Similarly, in (1,1), they choose randomly between the two queues, so the next state could be (2,1) or (1,2), but as we saw, (2,1) would lead to (1,2), which would then lead to (2,2), which is impossible. So actually, perhaps (2,1) is a state that cannot exist because it would require a cashier to serve two customers at the same time.\n\nWait, no, because in (2,1), one cashier is serving two customers, which is not possible. Therefore, the system cannot be in (2,1) or (1,2). So the only possible states are (0,0), (1,0), (0,1), and (1,1). Because if you have (1,1), the next customer goes to one, making it (2,1), which is invalid, so perhaps the system cannot have (1,1) either? Wait, no, because (1,1) is valid; both queues have one customer each, and each cashier is serving one customer. So (1,1) is a valid state.\n\nBut when a customer arrives in (1,1), they choose a random queue, say queue 1, which now becomes (2,1). But as we saw, that's not possible because queue 1 can't have two customers while queue 2 has one. So actually, perhaps the system cannot have (1,1) because it would lead to a state where one queue has two and the other has one, which is allowed as long as the service is happening one at a time.\n\nWait, no, in (1,1), both cashiers are serving one customer each, so the system is stable. Then, when a new customer arrives, they choose a queue randomly, say queue 1, which now has two customers, but since each cashier can only serve one at a time, the second customer in queue 1 will have to wait, but the cashier is busy with the first one. So actually, the system can have (2,1), but in that case, queue 1 has two customers waiting, and queue 2 has one. However, the cashier in queue 1 is busy serving the first customer, so the second customer has to wait, but the system can handle it as long as the total number of customers being served doesn't exceed the number of cashiers.\n\nWait, but in reality, each cashier can only handle one customer at a time, so the number of customers in each queue can be more than one, but the service is happening one at a time. So in (2,1), queue 1 has two customers waiting, but only one is being served, and queue 2 has one customer being served. So the total number of customers being served is two, which is equal to the number of cashiers, so that's fine.\n\nWait, but actually, in a M/M/s system, the number of customers in each queue can be more than one because customers are being served sequentially. So in our case, the system can have (2,1), (1,2), etc. But in our problem, customers always choose the shortest queue, so if one queue has two and the other has one, the next customer will go to the one with one, making it two. Then, the next customer goes to the other queue, making it two as well. So we can have (2,2), but as I thought before, that's impossible because each cashier can only serve one customer at a time, so (2,2) would mean both cashiers are serving two customers, which is not possible. Therefore, (2,2) is invalid.\n\nSo perhaps the system can only have states where the total number of customers is 0, 1, or 2, but with the condition that no state has both queues with two customers each.\n\nTherefore, the possible states are:\n\n- (0,0): both empty\n- (1,0) and (0,1): one has one, the other has none\n- (1,1): both have one\n\nAdditionally, from (1,0), the next customer goes to the other queue, making it (0,1). From (1,1), the next customer goes to one of the queues, making it (2,1) or (1,2). But as we saw, (2,1) is allowed as long as the service times are handled sequentially. However, if we have (2,1), the next customer will go to the shorter queue, which is the one with one, making it (1,2). Then, the next customer goes to the shorter one again, which is the one with one, making it (2,1). So it alternates between (2,1) and (1,2). But in this case, can we have a steady-state probability?\n\nWait, but in reality, the system cannot have (2,1) because that would imply one cashier is serving two customers, which is impossible. Therefore, perhaps the system cannot have (2,1) or (1,2). Therefore, the only possible states are (0,0), (1,0), (0,1), and (1,1).\n\nBut wait, if we have (1,1), the next customer goes to one queue, making it (2,1), which is invalid. So perhaps (1,1) is not a valid state because it leads to an invalid state. Therefore, the system can only be in (0,0) and (1,0), (0,1), because (1,1) would lead to an invalid state. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the system can only have a maximum of one customer in each queue because if one queue has two, the next customer will go to the other queue, making it one again. So the system alternates between (0,0), (1,0), (0,1), and (1,1). But when in (1,1), the next customer goes to one, making it (2,1), which is invalid. Therefore, the system cannot be in (1,1) because it leads to an invalid state. Therefore, the system can only be in (0,0), (1,0), and (0,1). But that seems odd because when both queues have one, the system is in a state where both cashiers are busy, but the queues are not empty.\n\nWait, but in the problem, we're asked about the probability that a newly arriving customer finds both cashiers idle, meaning both queues are empty. So maybe the system can only be in (0,0) and (1,0), (0,1), but not (1,1). Or perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nI think I need to find the steady-state probabilities of each state. Let's denote:\n\n- P0: probability that the system is in (0,0)\n- P1: probability that the system is in (1,0) or (0,1)\n- P2: probability that the system is in (1,1)\n\nWait, but as we discussed, (1,1) is a valid state, but the next customer will go to one, making it (2,1), which is invalid. So actually, from (1,1), the system transitions to (2,1), which is invalid, but that's not possible because the system must remain in valid states. Therefore, perhaps (1,1) cannot be a valid state because it leads to an invalid state upon arrival. Therefore, the system can only be in (0,0), (1,0), and (0,1).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the system can have (1,1) as a valid state because even though the next customer will go to one, making it (2,1), which is invalid, but perhaps the system can handle it by considering that the second customer in the queue will have to wait, but the cashier is busy. Wait, but in reality, each cashier can only serve one customer at a time, so having two customers in a queue is allowed, but the service times are sequential.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the system can have (2,1) as a state, but with the understanding that the second customer in the queue will have to wait, but the cashier is busy. So, in that case, the system can have (2,1) and (1,2) as valid states, but they are transient states that eventually lead back to (0,0), (1,0), or (0,1).\n\nTherefore, the system has the following states:\n\n- (0,0)\n- (1,0) and (0,1)\n- (2,1) and (1,2)\n\nBut the problem is that (2,1) and (1,2) can only be reached from (1,1). So, perhaps the system can be modeled with these states.\n\nLet me try to define the states:\n\n1. S0: (0,0)\n2. S1: (1,0) and (0,1)\n3. S2: (1,1)\n4. S3: (2,1) and (1,2)\n\nBut I'm not sure if S3 is necessary because from S2, the next state is S3, but S3 can transition back to S2 or to S0.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to consider the system as a Markov chain with states based on the number of customers in each queue, but considering that the system cannot have both queues with two customers each.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about the system as having two queues, each of which can have 0,1, or 2 customers, but with the condition that the total number of customers is conserved.\n\nBut I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nI recall that in a system where customers choose the shortest queue, the system is equivalent to a M/M/2 queue, but with the additional rule of choosing the shortest. However, in the standard M/M/2 model, the probability that both servers are idle is the same as the probability that the system is empty, which is the square of the probability that a single server is idle.\n\nWait, but in our case, the system is a bit different because customers choose the shortest queue. So perhaps the probability that both cashiers are idle is the same as the probability that the system is empty, which is the square of the probability that a single server is idle.\n\nBut wait, no, because in a M/M/2 system, the probability that both servers are idle is the probability that the system is empty, which is equal to the probability that a single server is idle squared, but I"

    "solution": "Solve this problem step by step. End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: A small shop has two cashiers working at different registers. Customers arrive at random according to a Poisson process with an average of 12 customers per hour. Upon arrival, a customer joins the shortest queue (if both queues are the same length, they choose randomly). Each cashier takes an average of 4 minutes to serve a customer, and service times follow an exponential distribution. At a random point in the day during steady-state operation, what is the probability that a newly arriving customer will find both cashiers idle (no customers waiting in line or being served)? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this probability problem to solve, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to understand what's being asked here.\n\nWe have a small shop with two cashiers, each working at their own register. Customers arrive at random according to a Poisson process, and the average number of customers per hour is 12. So, the Poisson rate parameter \u03bb is 12 per hour. That makes sense because Poisson processes are used to model the number of events happening in a fixed interval, which in this case is customer arrivals.\n\nNow, when a customer arrives, they join the shortest queue. If both queues are the same length, the customer chooses randomly between the two cashiers. Each cashier takes an average of 4 minutes to serve a customer, and the service times are exponentially distributed. That means the time taken for each service is memoryless, which is a characteristic of exponential distributions.\n\nThe question is asking for the probability that a newly arriving customer will find both cashiers idle at a random point in time during steady-state operation. So, we need to find the probability that both cashiers are free when a new customer arrives.\n\nHmm, okay. So, in steady-state, the system is in equilibrium, meaning the arrival rate equals the service rate for each cashier. But wait, since there are two cashiers, I think we need to consider the overall system's behavior.\n\nFirst, let's recall some concepts about Poisson processes and queueing theory. In a single-server queue with a Poisson arrival process and exponential service times, the steady-state probability that the server is idle is \u03bb/(\u03bb + \u03bc), where \u03bb is the arrival rate and \u03bc is the service rate. But here, we have two servers, so it's a bit more complex.\n\nIn the case of multiple servers, the probability that a new customer finds all servers idle can be found by considering the system as a combination of two independent Poisson processes, but with the constraint that a customer goes to the shortest queue. However, when both queues are equal, the customer chooses randomly.\n\nWait, but since the customer always goes to the shortest queue, or if equal, chooses randomly, maybe we can model this as a kind of load balancing problem. Since the service times are exponential, the system is memoryless, so maybe we can model the time until the next customer is served as exponential.\n\nLet me think about the arrival process. Since it's Poisson, the time between arrivals is exponential with parameter \u03bb. So, the time until the next customer arrives is exponential with rate \u03bb.\n\nNow, for each cashier, the service time is exponential with parameter \u03bc. Since each cashier takes an average of 4 minutes, \u03bc = 1/4 per minute, or 15 per hour? Wait, no, let's make sure about units. The average service time is 4 minutes, so in per minute, \u03bc is 1/4 per minute. But our arrival rate is 12 per hour, which is 12 customers per 60 minutes, so \u03bb = 12/60 = 0.2 per minute.\n\nWait, no, hold on. The problem says the average number of customers per hour is 12, so \u03bb is 12 per hour, which is 12/60 = 0.2 per minute. The service rate \u03bc is 1/4 per minute, because it takes 4 minutes per customer. So, service rate \u03bc = 1/4 per minute, arrival rate \u03bb = 12 per hour = 0.2 per minute.\n\nBut wait, that seems low. Because if each cashier is serving customers at a rate of 1/4 per minute, which is 15 per hour, so two cashiers can serve at a combined rate of 30 per hour. But the arrival rate is 12 per hour. So, the system is under capacity, which makes sense because the question is about the probability that both are idle.\n\nBut actually, in the problem, we are focusing on the probability that a new customer arrives when both are idle, regardless of the overall system capacity. So, maybe it's not directly about the system's capacity.\n\nLet me recall the formula for the probability that all servers are idle in a multi-server Poisson system. For n servers, the probability that all are idle when a new customer arrives is (\u03bb/(\u03bb + \u03bc))^n, but I'm not sure if that's correct because the service times are independent.\n\nWait, no, that formula might not be accurate because the arrival process is Poisson, and the service times are exponential, but the system has some dynamics where customers can be in service.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the time until the next customer is served. Since the arrival process is Poisson, the time between arrivals is exponential. The time until the next service completion is also exponential because the service times are exponential.\n\nBut since there are two cashiers, maybe the time until both are free is the maximum of two exponential variables. Hmm, that might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about the system as a combination of two M/M/2 queues, but with a specific load balancing policy. However, the load balancing is not exactly the usual one because customers always go to the shortest queue, or if equal, choose randomly.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to model the system as two independent queues, but with the customer choosing the shortest one. So, the arrival rate to each queue would depend on the length of the queues.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Maybe there's a simpler way.\n\nAlternatively, think about the probability that both cashiers are idle at the time of arrival. For a Poisson process, the time since the last arrival is exponential. So, the time since the last customer arrived is T ~ Exp(\u03bb). Similarly, the service times are exponential with rate \u03bc.\n\nBut the key is that the system is in steady-state, so the distribution of customers in each queue is in equilibrium.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model the number of customers in each queue as a Poisson distribution. But no, because the queues are not independent; they are balanced by the load.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use the concept of Little's Law, which states that the average number of customers in a system is equal to the arrival rate divided by the service rate. But since there are two cashiers, the total service rate is 2\u03bc.\n\nBut Little's Law gives us the average number of customers in the system, which is \u03bb_total / \u03bc_total. Here, \u03bb_total is 12 per hour, \u03bc_total is 2*(1/4) per minute, which is 0.5 per minute. So, average number of customers is 12 / 0.5 = 24.\n\nBut I'm not sure how that helps directly with the probability that both cashiers are idle.\n\nWait, perhaps we can think about the probability that a new customer arrives when both cashiers are free. Since the arrival process is Poisson, the time between arrivals is exponential. So, the time since the last arrival is T ~ Exp(\u03bb). For the customer to find both cashiers idle, the time since the last arrival must be greater than the service time of the last customer at both cashiers.\n\nBut since the service times are exponential, and the system is in steady-state, the time since the last customer finished at each cashier is also exponential with rate \u03bc.\n\nWait, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me try to formalize it.\n\nLet\u2019s denote T as the time since the last customer arrived. T is exponential with rate \u03bb. For the customer to find both cashiers idle, T must be greater than the time it takes for both cashiers to finish their current service. However, in reality, each cashier might be in the middle of serving a customer, so the time until they are free is exponential.\n\nBut since the arrival is Poisson, the time between arrivals is exponential, and the service times are exponential, the system can be modeled as a combination of two independent Poisson processes, but with the constraint that customers go to the shortest queue.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can consider the system as a single server with two possible queues, and model the probability that both queues are empty when a new customer arrives.\n\nWait, another approach: in a system with two identical servers, each with service rate \u03bc, the probability that a new customer finds all servers busy can be found by considering the combined service rate. But in our case, we need the probability that all servers are idle, which is the complement of all busy.\n\nBut I think the formula for the probability that all servers are idle in a Poisson system with n servers is \u03bb^n / (\u03bb + \u03bc)^n. Wait, no, that doesn't seem right.\n\nAlternatively, the probability that all servers are busy is (\u03bb/\u03bc)^n / (1 + (\u03bb/\u03bc)^n), but again, I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model the system as a Markov chain with states representing the number of customers in each queue. But that might be too involved.\n\nAlternatively, think about the system as two independent queues, but with customers choosing the shortest queue. Since the service times are exponential, the time until a cashier is free is exponential. So, the time until the next customer can be served is exponential.\n\nBut the arrival process is Poisson, so the time between arrivals is exponential. So, the probability that a new customer arrives when both cashiers are free is the probability that the time since the last arrival is greater than the maximum of two exponential variables with rate \u03bc.\n\nWait, let me think carefully.\n\nLet\u2019s denote T as the time since the last customer arrived, which is exponential with rate \u03bb. For the customer to find both cashiers idle, T must be greater than the time it takes for both cashiers to finish their current service.\n\nBut since the system is in steady-state, the time until the next customer is served at each cashier is exponential with rate \u03bc. So, the time until the next service completion at each cashier is Exp(\u03bc). Therefore, the time until both cashiers are free is the maximum of two independent exponential variables, each with rate \u03bc.\n\nSo, the probability that T > max(S1, S2), where S1 and S2 are exponential(\u03bc).\n\nBut T is exponential(\u03bb), and S1 and S2 are exponential(\u03bc). We need to find P(T > max(S1, S2)).\n\nThis can be rewritten as P(T > S1 and T > S2), which is P(T > max(S1, S2)).\n\nSince T, S1, S2 are all exponential variables, and they are independent, we can compute this probability.\n\nRecall that for two independent exponential variables S1 and S2 with rate \u03bc, the distribution of their maximum is known. The CDF of max(S1, S2) is 1 - (1 - e^{-\u03bc t})^2, so the PDF is 2\u03bc e^{-\u03bc t} for t \u2265 0.\n\nSimilarly, the CDF of T is 1 - e^{-\u03bb t}.\n\nSo, the probability that T > max(S1, S2) is the integral over t from 0 to infinity of P(T > t) * f_max(t) dt.\n\nWait, no, more accurately, P(T > max(S1, S2)) = E[1_{T > max(S1, S2)}] = E[E[1_{T > max(S1, S2)} | S1, S2]].\n\nBut since T is independent of S1 and S2, we can write it as E[1_{T > max(S1, S2)}] = E[ P(T > max(S1, S2) | S1, S2) ].\n\nWhich is E[ P(T > s1) * P(T > s2) | S1=s1, S2=s2 ].\n\nBut since T is independent, P(T > max(s1, s2)) = P(T > s1 and T > s2) = P(T > max(s1, s2)).\n\nWhich is equal to 1 - P(T \u2264 max(s1, s2)).\n\nBut since T is exponential(\u03bb), and s1 and s2 are exponential(\u03bc), we can compute this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the joint distribution.\n\nLet\u2019s consider the joint distribution of T, S1, S2. All are independent, so their joint PDF is \u03bb e^{-\u03bb t} * \u03bc e^{-\u03bc s1} * \u03bc e^{-\u03bc s2}.\n\nWe need to integrate over the region t > s1 and t > s2.\n\nSo, P(T > max(S1, S2)) = \u222b\u222b\u222b_{t > s1, t > s2} \u03bb \u03bc^2 e^{-\u03bb t} e^{-\u03bc s1} e^{-\u03bc s2} ds1 ds2 dt.\n\nThis integral can be simplified by first integrating over s1 and s2.\n\nLet\u2019s fix t, then s1 and s2 must be less than t. So, the integral over s1 and s2 becomes:\n\n\u222b_{0}^{t} \u222b_{0}^{t} \u03bb \u03bc^2 e^{-\u03bb t} e^{-\u03bc s1} e^{-\u03bc s2} ds1 ds2.\n\nFirst, integrate over s1:\n\n\u222b_{0}^{t} e^{-\u03bc s1} ds1 = [ -1/\u03bc e^{-\u03bc s1} ] from 0 to t = (1 - e^{-\u03bc t}) / \u03bc.\n\nSimilarly for s2: same result.\n\nSo, the double integral becomes \u03bb \u03bc^2 e^{-\u03bb t} * (1 - e^{-\u03bc t})^2 / \u03bc^2 = \u03bb e^{-\u03bb t} (1 - e^{-\u03bc t})^2.\n\nNow, integrate over t from 0 to infinity:\n\nP = \u222b_{0}^{\u221e} \u03bb e^{-\u03bb t} (1 - e^{-\u03bc t})^2 dt.\n\nLet\u2019s expand (1 - e^{-\u03bc t})^2:\n\n1 - 2 e^{-\u03bc t} + e^{-2 \u03bc t}.\n\nSo, P = \u222b_{0}^{\u221e} \u03bb e^{-\u03bb t} [1 - 2 e^{-\u03bc t} + e^{-2 \u03bc t}] dt.\n\nSplit the integral:\n\nP = \u03bb \u222b_{0}^{\u221e} e^{-\u03bb t} dt - 2 \u03bb \u222b_{0}^{\u221e} e^{-\u03bb t} e^{-\u03bc t} dt + \u03bb \u222b_{0}^{\u221e} e^{-\u03bb t} e^{-2 \u03bc t} dt.\n\nCompute each integral:\n\nFirst integral: \u222b e^{- (\u03bb) t} dt = 1/\u03bb.\n\nSecond integral: \u222b e^{-(\u03bb + \u03bc) t} dt = 1/(\u03bb + \u03bc).\n\nThird integral: \u222b e^{-(\u03bb + 2 \u03bc) t} dt = 1/(\u03bb + 2 \u03bc).\n\nSo, putting it together:\n\nP = \u03bb*(1/\u03bb) - 2 \u03bb*(1/(\u03bb + \u03bc)) + \u03bb*(1/(\u03bb + 2 \u03bc)).\n\nSimplify:\n\nP = 1 - 2 \u03bb / (\u03bb + \u03bc) + \u03bb / (\u03bb + 2 \u03bc).\n\nSo, that's the probability that T > max(S1, S2), which is the probability that a new customer arrives when both cashiers are idle.\n\nWait, but let's check the units and the values.\n\nGiven \u03bb = 12 per hour, which is 0.2 per minute, and \u03bc = 1/4 per minute.\n\nSo, plug in the values:\n\nP = 1 - 2*(0.2)/(0.2 + 0.25) + 0.2/(0.2 + 2*0.25).\n\nCompute denominators:\n\n0.2 + 0.25 = 0.45\n\n0.2 + 0.5 = 0.7\n\nSo,\n\nP = 1 - 2*(0.2)/0.45 + 0.2/0.7.\n\nCalculate each term:\n\n2*(0.2)/0.45 = 0.4 / 0.45 \u2248 0.8889\n\n0.2/0.7 \u2248 0.2857\n\nSo,\n\nP \u2248 1 - 0.8889 + 0.2857 \u2248 1 - 0.8889 + 0.2857 \u2248 0.3968.\n\nSo, approximately 0.3968, or 39.68%.\n\nBut let's write it more precisely.\n\nCompute 2\u03bb/(\u03bb + \u03bc):\n\n2*0.2 / (0.2 + 0.25) = 0.4 / 0.45 = 4/9 \u2248 0.4444\n\nAnd \u03bb/(\u03bb + 2\u03bc) = 0.2 / (0.2 + 0.5) = 0.2 / 0.7 \u2248 0.2857\n\nSo,\n\nP = 1 - 4/9 + 2/7\n\nWait, 0.2/0.7 is 2/7, right? Because 0.2 = 2/10 = 1/5, and 0.7 = 7/10, so (1/5)/(7/10) = (1/5)*(10/7) = 2/7.\n\nSimilarly, 0.4/0.45 = 4/9.\n\nSo,\n\nP = 1 - 4/9 + 2/7\n\nTo compute this, find a common denominator. 9 and 7 are coprime, so 63.\n\n1 = 63/63\n\n4/9 = 28/63\n\n2/7 = 18/63\n\nSo,\n\nP = 63/63 - 28/63 + 18/63 = (63 - 28 + 18)/63 = (53)/63 \u2248 0.841.\n\nWait, that can't be right because 1 - 4/9 + 2/7 is approximately 1 - 0.4444 + 0.2857 \u2248 0.841.\n\nBut earlier, when I computed numerically, I got approximately 0.3968. There's a discrepancy here. I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, no, wait. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, the expression I derived was P = 1 - 2\u03bb/(\u03bb + \u03bc) + \u03bb/(\u03bb + 2\u03bc).\n\nPlugging in \u03bb=0.2, \u03bc=0.25:\n\nP = 1 - 2*(0.2)/(0.2 + 0.25) + 0.2/(0.2 + 2*0.25)\n\n= 1 - (0.4)/0.45 + 0.2/0.7\n\n= 1 - 0.8889 + 0.2857 \u2248 0.3968.\n\nBut when I converted it to fractions, I got 1 - 4/9 + 2/7 \u2248 0.841.\n\nWait, no, I think I messed up the fractions.\n\nWait, 2\u03bb/(\u03bb + \u03bc) = 2*0.2/(0.2 + 0.25) = 0.4/0.45 = 4/9 \u2248 0.4444\n\nSimilarly, \u03bb/(\u03bb + 2\u03bc) = 0.2/(0.2 + 0.5) = 0."

    "solution": "Solve this problem step by step. End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: A small shop has two cashiers working at different registers. Customers arrive at random according to a Poisson process with an average of 12 customers per hour. Upon arrival, a customer joins the shortest queue (if both queues are the same length, they choose randomly). Each cashier takes an average of 4 minutes to serve a customer, and service times follow an exponential distribution. At a random point in the day during steady-state operation, what is the probability that a newly arriving customer will find both cashiers idle (no customers waiting in line or being served)? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this problem about a small shop with two cashiers. The customers arrive randomly according to a Poisson process, averaging 12 customers per hour. When a customer arrives, they join the shortest queue. If both queues are the same length, they choose randomly. Each cashier takes an average of 4 minutes to serve a customer, and the service times follow an exponential distribution. The question is asking for the probability that a newly arriving customer will find both cashiers idle at a random point in time during steady-state operation.\n\nHmm, okay, let me try to break this down. First, I know that in a Poisson process, the time between arrivals is exponential. So, the inter-arrival times are exponential with a rate parameter of 12 per hour. But here, the service times are also exponential with an average of 4 minutes. Wait, so the service rate would be 1/(4) customers per minute, which is 15 customers per hour. Hmm, that's important because if the service rate is higher than the arrival rate, the system might be stable, right? Let me check that.\n\nThe arrival rate \u03bb is 12 per hour, and the service rate \u03bc is 15 per hour. Since \u03bb < \u03bc, that means the system is stable, so in steady-state, the number of customers in the system should be finite. That\u2019s good to know.\n\nNow, the question is about the probability that a new customer arrives and finds both cashiers idle. So, at the moment the customer arrives, both registers should be free, both in terms of not having any customers waiting and not having a customer being served.\n\nWait, but in this setup, each customer upon arrival joins the shortest queue. So, if both queues are equal, the customer chooses randomly between the two. But the question is about the probability that both cashiers are idle when a customer arrives, regardless of where they choose to queue. So, I think it's about the probability that both registers are free at the time of arrival.\n\nBut I need to model this as a system. So, let me think about how to model this system. Since customers are arriving according to a Poisson process, and service times are exponential, this is a typical queueing model where both arrival and service times are Poisson processes, making it a Poisson queue.\n\nBut wait, in this case, the customers choose the shortest queue. So, the system isn't just two independent queues; the queues are being balanced by the customers' choice. So, it's a load-balancing system.\n\nHmm, so the system is a two-server queue with customers joining the shortest queue, and if equal, random choice. So, I need to model this as a two-server exponential queue with load balancing.\n\nIn such systems, the steady-state distribution can be found, and from there, we can find the probability that both servers are idle when a customer arrives.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a simpler way. Since the service times are exponential, the time until the next service completion is memoryless. Also, the arrival process is Poisson, so the system is in steady-state.\n\nI recall that in a two-server exponential queue with random load balancing, the probability that both servers are idle is equal to (1/(N)) where N is the number of servers, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, that doesn't sound right.\n\nAlternatively, I think the probability that both servers are idle when a customer arrives can be found by considering the state of the system. Since the system is in steady-state, the probability that a server is busy is \u03bc/\u03bb, which is 15/12 = 1.25, but wait, that can't be because probabilities can't exceed 1. Oh, wait, no, that's the utilization factor. Let me correct that.\n\nThe utilization factor for each server is \u03bb/\u03bc. So, \u03bb is 12 per hour, and \u03bc is 15 per hour, so \u03bb/\u03bc = 12/15 = 0.8. So, each server is 80% utilized on average.\n\nWait, but I'm looking for the probability that both servers are idle. So, perhaps I can model the system as two independent exponential servers, each with utilization 0.8, and find the probability that both are idle at a random time.\n\nBut wait, in this case, the two servers are not independent because customers are joining the shortest queue, so there is some dependency between them. So, they are not independent, which complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model the system as a Markov chain where the state is the number of customers in each queue, and then find the stationary distribution. From that, I can compute the probability that both queues are empty when a customer arrives.\n\nBut that might be complicated. Maybe there's a formula for this. I think for a two-server system with random load balancing, the probability that both servers are idle is (1 - \u03c1)^2, where \u03c1 is the utilization factor. Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct.\n\nWait, \u03c1 is the overall utilization, which is \u03bb/\u03bc. So, in this case, \u03c1 = 0.8. So, (1 - 0.8)^2 = (0.2)^2 = 0.04, so 4%. But that seems low. Is that correct?\n\nWait, I'm not sure. Maybe I should think differently. Let's consider the time between arrivals. Since the arrival rate is 12 per hour, which is 0.2 per minute, the inter-arrival time is exponential with rate 0.2 per minute.\n\nSimilarly, the service time is exponential with rate 15 per hour, which is 0.25 per minute. So, the service rate is 15 per hour, which is 0.25 per minute.\n\nWait, but I'm trying to find the probability that both cashiers are idle when a customer arrives. So, at the moment of arrival, both registers are free. So, the time since the last customer left each register is more than the arrival time.\n\nWait, perhaps I can model the time until the next arrival and the time until the next service completion as independent exponential variables. But since the system is in steady-state, the times between arrivals and service completions are independent.\n\nWait, but in this case, because the system is load-balanced, the queues might be kept balanced, so the times until the next service completion on each register could be dependent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the concept of the system being in a steady-state where the probability that a server is busy is equal to the utilization, which is 0.8. So, the probability that a server is idle is 1 - 0.8 = 0.2.\n\nBut since the two servers are not independent, the probability that both are idle is not just (0.2)*(0.2) = 0.04. Because their idleness is dependent.\n\nWait, perhaps I can model this as the joint probability that both servers are idle. So, in a two-server system, the probability that both are idle is equal to the probability that the last customer finished serving at least t minutes ago, where t is the time since the last arrival.\n\nWait, but I'm getting confused. Let me try to think in terms of the system's state.\n\nIn a two-server system with random load balancing, the system is balanced in such a way that the number of customers in each queue is either equal or differs by one, depending on the load balancing policy. Since the load balancing is random when queues are equal, the system can be in states where the number of customers in each queue is equal, or one has one more than the other.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that helps me directly. Maybe I can consider the steady-state probability that both queues are empty, which would correspond to both cashiers being idle.\n\nWait, but the question is about a newly arriving customer finding both cashiers idle. So, it's about the probability that when a customer arrives, both registers are free.\n\nIn a Poisson process, the time between arrivals is exponential, so the probability that a customer arrives when both registers are free can be found by considering the time since the last customer arrived and the time since the last customer was served.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Maybe I can model the system as two independent exponential servers with utilization 0.8, but with load balancing, which might make them dependent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of the system as a single server with some kind of grouping, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, I think I found a formula somewhere that for a two-server system with random load balancing, the probability that both servers are idle is (1 - \u03c1)^2, where \u03c1 is the utilization. So, with \u03c1 = 0.8, that would be (0.2)^2 = 0.04, which is 4%.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure if that's correct. Let me think about it again.\n\nIf each server has a utilization of 0.8, then the probability that a server is busy is 0.8, and idle is 0.2. But since the two servers are not independent, the joint probability that both are idle is not just 0.2*0.2=0.04.\n\nWait, but in a Poisson process, the arrival times and service times are independent. So, perhaps I can model the time since the last customer arrived at each register as independent exponential variables with rate \u03bb, and the time since the last customer was served as independent exponential variables with rate \u03bc.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Maybe I can consider the time until the next arrival and the time until the next service completion on each register.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think of the system as a single server with two possible states: one where the next customer goes to server 1, and the other where it goes to server 2. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that in a two-server system with random load balancing, the probability that both servers are idle is equal to the probability that the system is in the state where both queues are empty. In the steady-state, the probability of both queues being empty can be found using some formula.\n\nWait, I think I recall that in a two-server exponential queue with random load balancing, the probability that both servers are idle is (1 - \u03c1)^2, where \u03c1 is the utilization. So, with \u03c1 = 0.8, that gives (0.2)^2 = 0.04, which is 4%.\n\nBut I'm not entirely confident. Let me try to derive it.\n\nConsider that the system is in steady-state. Let\u2019s denote the utilization factor for each server as \u03c1 = \u03bb/\u03bc = 0.8.\n\nThe probability that a server is busy is \u03c1, so the probability that it's idle is 1 - \u03c1 = 0.2.\n\nBut since the two servers are not independent, the joint probability that both are idle is not just (1 - \u03c1)^2.\n\nWait, but perhaps we can model the system as two independent exponential servers, each with utilization 0.8, and find the probability that both are idle.\n\nIn that case, the probability that the first server is idle is 0.2, and the second server is idle is 0.2, but since they are independent, the joint probability is 0.2*0.2=0.04.\n\nBut in reality, the two servers are not independent because customers are being distributed between them, so their idleness is dependent.\n\nHmm, so maybe the formula (1 - \u03c1)^2 isn't accurate for this case.\n\nWait, perhaps I can model the system as a Markov chain where the state is the number of customers in each queue, and then find the steady-state probability that the number of customers in each queue is zero.\n\nBut that might be complicated. Let me think about the system as a two-server queue with random load balancing.\n\nIn such a system, the arrival process is Poisson, and service times are exponential. The system is balanced by the arrival process choosing the shortest queue, or randomly if equal.\n\nIn this case, the system will tend to have queues balanced, so the number of customers in each queue is either equal or differs by one.\n\nBut I'm interested in the probability that when a customer arrives, both queues are empty.\n\nWait, perhaps I can consider the time between arrivals and the time between service completions.\n\nSince the arrival rate is \u03bb = 12 per hour, which is 0.2 per minute, the inter-arrival time is exponential with rate 0.2.\n\nSimilarly, the service rate is \u03bc = 15 per hour, which is 0.25 per minute, so the service time is exponential with rate 0.25.\n\nNow, the time until the next arrival is exponential with rate 0.2, and the time until the next service completion on each register is exponential with rate 0.25.\n\nBut since the system is load-balanced, the time until the next service completion on each register might be dependent.\n\nWait, perhaps I can model the system as a single server with a certain service time, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the system as a two-server system where each server has a service rate of 15 per hour, and the arrival rate is 12 per hour, so each server is being used at 0.8 of its capacity.\n\nIn such a system, the probability that a server is busy is 0.8, and idle is 0.2. But again, the two servers are not independent.\n\nWait, perhaps I can consider the system as a Poisson process with rate \u03bb = 12 per hour, and each customer, upon arrival, is assigned to one of the two servers with equal probability if the queues are equal, or to the shorter queue otherwise.\n\nIn this case, the system will have a certain distribution of the number of customers in each queue, and from that, I can find the probability that both queues are empty when a customer arrives.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to calculate that.\n\nWait, maybe I can use the concept of the system's idle probability for each server and then combine them.\n\nBut I think I'm going in circles here. Let me try to recall if there's a known formula for this.\n\nI think for a two-server system with random load balancing, the probability that both servers are idle is (1 - \u03c1)^2, where \u03c1 is the utilization. So, with \u03c1 = 0.8, that would be (0.2)^2 = 0.04.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure if this applies here because the load balancing is based on the queue lengths, which complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the system as a single server with a service rate of \u03bc = 15 per hour, but with customers being split equally between two servers. So, the effective service rate per server is 7.5 per hour, but that's not correct because the service times are exponential.\n\nWait, no, the service rate is \u03bc = 15 per hour, regardless of the number of servers. So, each server can handle up to 15 per hour.\n\nBut the arrival rate is 12 per hour, so each server is handling 6 per hour on average, since they are being split equally.\n\nWait, but that's not necessarily the case because the load balancing is based on the queue lengths, so the distribution might not be perfectly even.\n\nHmm, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look for a formula or a known result for the probability that both servers are idle in a two-server exponential queue with random load balancing.\n\nAfter some thinking, I recall that in a two-server exponential queue with random load balancing, the probability that both servers are idle is (1 - \u03c1)^2, where \u03c1 is the utilization factor. So, with \u03c1 = 0.8, that gives (0.2)^2 = 0.04, or 4%.\n\nBut I'm not entirely confident. Let me see if I can derive it.\n\nConsider that each server has a service rate of \u03bc = 15 per hour, and the arrival rate is \u03bb = 12 per hour. So, the utilization per server is \u03bb/\u03bc = 0.8.\n\nIn steady-state, the probability that a server is busy is \u03c1 = 0.8, and idle is 1 - \u03c1 = 0.2.\n\nNow, the events that server 1 is idle and server 2 is idle are not independent, but in a two-server system with random load balancing, the probability that both are idle can be found by considering the system's state.\n\nWait, perhaps I can model the system as a Markov chain where the state is the number of customers in each queue, and find the steady-state probability that both queues are empty.\n\nBut that might be too involved. Alternatively, I can think of the system as a single server with a certain service time, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another approach: the probability that both servers are idle is equal to the probability that the time since the last arrival is greater than the time since the last service completion on both servers.\n\nBut since the arrival times and service times are independent, perhaps I can model the time until the next arrival and the time until the next service completion on each server as independent exponential variables.\n\nWait, but the service times on each server are dependent because the load balancing affects the service times.\n\nHmm, I'm not sure. Maybe I can consider the system as two independent exponential servers, each with utilization 0.8, and then find the probability that both are idle.\n\nIn that case, the probability that server 1 is idle is 0.2, and similarly for server 2. But since they are independent, the joint probability is 0.2*0.2=0.04.\n\nBut in reality, the two servers are not independent because customers are being distributed between them, so their idleness is dependent.\n\nWait, but in a Poisson process, the arrival times and service times are independent, so maybe the time since the last arrival and the time since the last service on each server can be modeled as independent.\n\nWait, perhaps I can consider the time until the next arrival as exponential with rate \u03bb = 0.2 per minute, and the time until the next service completion on each server as exponential with rate \u03bc = 0.25 per minute.\n\nBut the time until the next service completion on each server depends on the load balancing, so maybe they are not independent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model the system as a single server with a service rate of \u03bc = 15 per hour, and the arrival rate is \u03bb = 12 per hour. Then, the probability that the system is empty when a customer arrives is (1 - \u03c1)^2, where \u03c1 = \u03bb/\u03bc = 0.8.\n\nWait, that would give (1 - 0.8)^2 = 0.04, which is 4%.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's correct because the system has two servers, not one.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula (1 - \u03c1)^2 does apply here because the two servers are operating in parallel, and the probability that both are idle is the square of the probability that one is idle.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let me think again.\n\nIf the system had only one server, the probability that it's idle when a customer arrives would be 1 - \u03c1 = 0.2. But with two servers, the probability that both are idle is the probability that neither server is busy, which would be ("

    "solution": "Solve this problem step by step. End with 'DONE.' when you have a solution. \n\n Question: A small shop has two cashiers working at different registers. Customers arrive at random according to a Poisson process with an average of 12 customers per hour. Upon arrival, a customer joins the shortest queue (if both queues are the same length, they choose randomly). Each cashier takes an average of 4 minutes to serve a customer, and service times follow an exponential distribution. At a random point in the day during steady-state operation, what is the probability that a newly arriving customer will find both cashiers idle (no customers waiting in line or being served)? \n\n Solution: \n<think>\nAlright, so I have this problem about a small shop with two cashiers. Customers come in randomly according to a Poisson process, averaging 12 customers per hour. When they arrive, they join the shortest queue. If both queues are the same length, they choose randomly. Each cashier takes an average of 4 minutes to serve a customer, and the service times are exponentially distributed. I need to find the probability that a new customer arrives when both cashiers are idle, meaning no one is waiting in line or being served.\n\nHmm, okay. Let me break this down. First, I remember that in a Poisson process, the number of events in a given time interval follows a Poisson distribution. So, the arrival rate is 12 per hour, which is 0.2 per minute. That might be useful later.\n\nNow, the shop has two cashiers, so customers can choose between two queues. Each customer goes to the shorter queue. If both are equal, it's random. So, the system is a kind of balanced queueing system.\n\nEach cashier serves customers in an exponential time, which is memoryless. That's a key property of exponential distributions. It might be useful for modeling the system.\n\nI need to find the probability that when a new customer arrives, both cashiers are idle. That is, there are zero customers waiting in line at both registers, and both cashiers are not currently serving anyone.\n\nWait, actually, the question says \"no customers waiting in line or being served.\" So, that means both registers are empty. So, the state is that both queues have zero customers. But since customers arrive randomly, I need to find the probability that when a customer arrives, both registers are free.\n\nHmm. How do I model this? I think I need to model the system as a Markov chain with different states based on the number of customers at each register.\n\nBut maybe there's a simpler way. I remember that in a single-server queue with Poisson arrivals and exponential service times, the stationary distribution has a certain property where the probability that the server is idle is related to the service rate.\n\nWait, maybe I can generalize this to two servers. Let me think.\n\nEach server has a service rate of 4 minutes per customer, so the service rate per minute is 4/60 = 1/15 customers per minute. Wait, no, the service rate in Poisson processes is usually given in terms of the rate parameter. So, if each cashier takes 4 minutes on average, the service rate \u03bb is 1/4 customers per minute, right? Because rate \u03bb is inverse of mean time.\n\nWait, no, actually, for exponential distributions, the mean service time is 1/\u03bb, so if the average service time is 4 minutes, then \u03bb = 1/4 per minute, which is 15 per hour. So, each cashier can serve 15 customers per hour.\n\nWait, but the arrival rate is 12 per hour. So, the shop has two cashiers, each serving at 15 per hour, but only 12 customers arrive per hour. So, the system should be stable since the total service rate (30 per hour) is greater than the arrival rate (12 per hour).\n\nOkay, so it's a stable system.\n\nNow, the problem is to find the probability that a new customer arrives and finds both cashiers idle. That is, the system is empty when the customer arrives.\n\nBut in reality, the system isn't always empty. So, we need to model the system's state and find the stationary distribution.\n\nI think this is a two-server queue with Poisson arrivals and exponential service times. Each customer chooses the shortest queue, breaking ties randomly.\n\nI need to find the stationary probability that both servers are idle when a customer arrives.\n\nWait, but when a customer arrives, they join the shortest queue. So, the state is determined by the number of customers at each queue.\n\nLet me denote the number of customers at cashier 1 as N1 and at cashier 2 as N2.\n\nSince customers always go to the shorter queue, the state transitions depend on whether N1 < N2, N1 > N2, or N1 = N2.\n\nIf N1 = N2, the customer chooses randomly, so with probability 0.5, it goes to N1 or N2.\n\nIn the stationary distribution, the proportion of time the system is in each state (N1, N2) can be found by solving the balance equations.\n\nBut this might get complicated because the state space is infinite. However, there's a concept called \"renewal theory\" or \"stationary distribution for M/M/2/2\" systems.\n\nWait, M/M/2/2 system. M/M/s/n systems have known results for their stationary distributions.\n\nI recall that for M/M/s/n systems, the stationary distribution can be found using certain formulas, especially when s = n. But in our case, it's a bit different because the customers choose the shortest queue, which is slightly more complicated than just going to the first server.\n\nWait, actually, in our case, each customer independently chooses the shorter queue, so it's a kind of \"Processor Sharing\" model? Or is it a \"Round Robin\" scheduling?\n\nNo, not exactly. It's more like customers are assigned to the shortest queue, which can be seen as a load balancing algorithm.\n\nHmm, I think this is similar to the \"balanced server\" system, where each job is assigned to the server with the smallest current load.\n\nI need to find the stationary probability that both servers are empty when a customer arrives.\n\nWait, but in a Poisson process, the time between arrivals is exponential, so the system is in a random state when a customer arrives.\n\nSo, the probability that both cashiers are idle when a customer arrives is equal to the stationary probability that both N1 = 0 and N2 = 0.\n\nBut in the stationary distribution, the probability that N1 = 0 and N2 = 0 is the same as the probability that the system is empty, which is not necessarily zero.\n\nWait, actually, in a stable system, the stationary distribution assigns some positive probability to the empty state.\n\nWait, is that true? Or is the empty state only a transient state?\n\nHmm, I think in the case of a Poisson process with exponential service times, the system can be empty, but the probability of being empty at any given time is not zero.\n\nBut how do I calculate it?\n\nI recall that for a single-server M/M/1 system, the probability that the server is idle is 1/(1 + \u03bb/\u03bc), where \u03bb is the arrival rate and \u03bc is the service rate.\n\nWait, let me verify that. For a single server with Poisson arrivals and exponential service times, the stationary distribution \u03c00 is \u03c00 = \u03bc/(\u03bb + \u03bc). So, the probability that the server is idle is \u03bc/(\u03bb + \u03bc). That makes sense because the ratio of service to arrival rates.\n\nIn our case, with two servers, each with service rate \u03bc = 15 per hour (since average service time is 4 minutes, which is 1/15 per minute), and arrival rate \u03bb = 12 per hour.\n\nSo, for a single server, the probability of being idle is \u03bc/(\u03bb + \u03bc) = 15/(12 + 15) = 15/27 = 5/9 \u2248 0.555.\n\nBut we have two servers. So, the probability that both are idle when a customer arrives.\n\nWait, is this just (\u03bc1 \u03bc2)/( (\u03bc1 + \u03bc2) \u03bb ) ?\n\nWait, that doesn't sound right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's (\u03bc1 \u03bc2)/( (\u03bc1 + \u03bc2) \u03bb ) ?\n\nWait, no, that might not be correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's (\u03bc1 \u03bc2)/( (\u03bc1 + \u03bc2) \u03bb ) ?\n\nWait, actually, let me think about the two-server case.\n\nEach customer, upon arrival, chooses the shortest queue. So, if both queues are equal, it's random. So, the system is a kind of \"balanced\" system.\n\nI think the stationary distribution can be found by considering the balance equations.\n\nLet me denote the stationary probability of having k customers at the first server and m customers at the second server as \u03c0_{k,m}.\n\nBut considering all possible k and m is complicated. Instead, maybe I can use the fact that the system is symmetric.\n\nWait, but the arrival process is Poisson, so the system is memoryless.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the concept of Little's Law.\n\nWait, Little's Law says that the expected number of customers in the system is \u03bb_w * W, where \u03bb_w is the arrival rate and W is the expected waiting time.\n\nBut I'm not sure how that helps here.\n\nWait, maybe I can model the system as two independent M/M/1 queues, but with customers choosing the shorter one.\n\nBut that might not be accurate because the queues are not independent; a customer choosing one affects the other.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the probability that both queues are empty when a customer arrives.\n\nWait, so when a customer arrives, they choose the shorter queue. If both are empty, they go to a random one. So, the probability that both are empty is the probability that the system is empty.\n\nBut in the stationary distribution, the system isn't always empty. So, the probability that the system is empty when a customer arrives is equal to the stationary probability that the system is empty.\n\nBut I need to find that stationary probability.\n\nWait, perhaps I can model this as a Markov chain where the state is the number of customers at each register, and the transitions are determined by the arrival and service processes.\n\nBut that's going to be complicated because the state space is infinite.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the concept of \"renewal theory\" for Poisson processes.\n\nWait, the probability that the system is empty at a random time is equal to the stationary distribution of the number of customers in the system.\n\nBut in our case, we need the probability that both registers are empty when a customer arrives, which is the same as the stationary probability that the system is empty.\n\nWait, is that correct? Because when a customer arrives, the system can be empty or not.\n\nIf the system is empty, then the new customer starts service at one of the registers.\n\nIf the system is not empty, the new customer joins the shorter queue.\n\nBut I need the probability that the system is empty when the customer arrives.\n\nSo, in the stationary distribution, the probability that the system is empty is equal to the stationary probability that N1 = 0 and N2 = 0.\n\nBut how do I find that?\n\nI think for M/M/s/n systems, the stationary probability that all s servers are idle is given by some formula.\n\nWait, actually, in the case of a single server, the stationary probability that the server is idle is \u03bc/(\u03bb + \u03bc). For two servers, maybe it's \u03bc1 \u03bc2 / ( (\u03bc1 + \u03bc2) \u03bb ) ?\n\nWait, let me check the formula for the probability that all servers are idle in an M/M/2/2 system.\n\nI recall that for M/M/s/n systems, the stationary probability that all servers are idle is (s!)/(s^n) * (\u03bc1 \u03bc2 ... \u03bcs)/( (\u03bc1 + \u03bc2 + ... + \u03bcs) \u03bb ) ).\n\nWait, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's (\u03bc1 \u03bc2)/( (\u03bc1 + \u03bc2) \u03bb ) ?\n\nWait, let's think about the two-server case.\n\nEach server has a service rate \u03bc1 = \u03bc2 = 15 per hour (since average service time is 4 minutes, which is 1/15 per minute, so per hour 60*(1/15)=4 customers per hour? Wait, no, wait.\n\nWait, service rate is usually in terms of per minute. So, average service time is 4 minutes per customer, so the service rate \u03bc is 1/4 per minute, which is 15 per hour. Similarly, the arrival rate \u03bb is 12 per hour.\n\nSo, \u03bc1 = \u03bc2 = 15 per hour.\n\nSo, for the two-server case, the probability that both servers are idle when a customer arrives is equal to the stationary probability that both servers are empty, which is the same as the probability that the system is empty.\n\nI think the formula for the stationary probability that all servers are idle in an M/M/2/2 system is (\u03bc1 \u03bc2)/( (\u03bc1 + \u03bc2) \u03bb ) ).\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers:\n\n\u03bc1 = \u03bc2 = 15 per hour.\n\nSo, \u03bc1 \u03bc2 = 15*15 = 225.\n\n\u03bc1 + \u03bc2 = 30.\n\n\u03bb = 12 per hour.\n\nSo, (\u03bc1 \u03bc2)/( (\u03bc1 + \u03bc2) \u03bb ) = 225 / (30 * 12) = 225 / 360 = 5/8 = 0.625.\n\nSo, the probability is 5/8.\n\nWait, that seems reasonable.\n\nAlternatively, let me think about it in terms of the single-server case.\n\nIn a single server, the probability of being idle is \u03bc/(\u03bb + \u03bc) = 15/(12 + 15) = 15/27 = 5/9 \u2248 0.555.\n\nBut with two servers, each can take half the load, so the probability should be higher.\n\nWait, 5/8 is 0.625, which is higher than 5/9. That makes sense because with two servers, the chance that both are idle is higher.\n\nSo, I think 5/8 is the correct answer.\n\nTherefore, the probability that a newly arriving customer will find both cashiers idle is 5/8.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe probability is \\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{8}}.\nDONE.\n</think>\n\nThe problem involves a small shop with two cashiers where customers arrive according to a Poisson process with an average of 12 customers per hour. Each customer joins the shortest queue, and if both queues are equal, they choose randomly. Each cashier takes an average of 4 minutes to serve a customer, with service times following an exponential distribution. We need to find the probability that a newly arriving customer will find both cashiers idle.\n\n1. **Poisson Process and Exponential Distribution**:\n   - The arrival rate is 12 per hour, which is 0.2 per minute.\n   - Each cashier's service rate is 15 per hour (since the average service time is 4 minutes, the service rate is 1/4 per minute, which is 15 per hour).\n\n2. **Stationary Probability Calculation**:\n   - For a single-server M/M/1 system, the stationary probability that the server is idle is given by \u03bc/(\u03bb + \u03bc).\n   - For two servers, the stationary probability that both servers are idle is given by the formula (\u03bc1 \u03bc2)/( (\u03bc1 + \u03bc2) \u03bb ).\n\n3. **Applying the Formula**:\n   - \u03bc1 = \u03bc2 = 15 per hour.\n   - \u03bc1 \u03bc2 = 15 * 15 = 225.\n   - \u03bc1 + \u03bc2 = 30.\n   - \u03bb = 12 per hour.\n   - The probability is (225) / (30 * 12) = 225 / 360 = 5/8.\n\nThus, the probability that a newly arriving customer will find both cashiers idle is \\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{8}}."
