  "question": "You have a sheet of paper with a single continuous closed curve drawn on it. The curve doesn't intersect itself at any point. Does this curve divide the plane into exactly two regions? If so, explain which two regions these are and what property distinguishes them from each other.",
  "answer": "Yes, a single continuous closed curve that doesn't intersect itself (also known as a simple closed curve) always divides the plane into exactly two regions.\n\nStep 1: Identify the regions\n- One region is the 'inside' of the curve\n- One region is the 'outside' of the curve\n\nStep 2: Understand what distinguishes these regions\n- The key property that distinguishes these regions is connectivity. Any two points in the same region can be connected by a continuous path that doesn't cross the curve.\n- Any path connecting a point from the inside region to a point in the outside region must cross the curve at least once.\n\nStep 3: Verify using the Jordan Curve Theorem\n- This result is formalized in mathematics as the Jordan Curve Theorem, which states that every simple closed curve in the plane separates the plane into exactly two regions: an 'inside' and an 'outside'.\n- The inside region is bounded (has finite area), while the outside region is unbounded (extends infinitely).\n\nThis topological property is invariant - it doesn't matter what shape the curve takes, as long as it's closed and doesn't self-intersect, it will always divide the plane into exactly two regions."
