  "question": "In a small university class of 15 students, each student is assigned a unique student ID number from 1 to 30 inclusive. Prove that regardless of which specific ID numbers are assigned, there must be at least one pair of students whose ID numbers sum to 31.",
  "answer": "This problem can be solved using the Pigeonhole Principle.\n\nStep 1: Let's organize the possible 30 ID numbers into 15 pairs, where each pair sums to 31:\n(1,30), (2,29), (3,28), (4,27), (5,26), (6,25), (7,24), (8,23), (9,22), (10,21), (11,20), (12,19), (13,18), (14,17), (15,16)\n\nStep 2: Notice that we have 15 pairs of numbers that sum to 31.\n\nStep 3: In our class, we must assign 15 different ID numbers to the 15 students.\n\nStep 4: By the Pigeonhole Principle, if we place 15 items (the student ID numbers) into 15 categories (the pairs that sum to 31), and each category can hold at most 2 items, then at least one category must contain exactly 2 items.\n\nStep 5: This means that at least one of our pairs must have both numbers assigned to students in the class.\n\nStep 6: Therefore, there must be at least one pair of students whose ID numbers sum to 31.\n\nThis is a direct application of the Pigeonhole Principle because we have 15 students selecting ID numbers from 15 pairs, so at least one pair must have both its numbers selected."
