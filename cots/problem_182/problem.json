  "question": "Consider the following statements about people in a small town:\n1. All doctors in this town are wealthy.\n2. Some teachers in this town are not wealthy.\n\nWhich of the following conclusions can be validly deduced from these statements?\n\nA) Some teachers are not doctors.\nB) No teachers are doctors.\nC) Some doctors are teachers.\nD) All wealthy people are doctors.",
  "answer": "The correct answer is A) Some teachers are not doctors.\n\nLet's use predicate logic to analyze this problem:\n\nLet D(x) mean \"x is a doctor\"\nLet T(x) mean \"x is a teacher\"\nLet W(x) mean \"x is wealthy\"\n\nThe given statements can be written as:\n1. \u2200x(D(x) \u2192 W(x)) - All doctors are wealthy\n2. \u2203x(T(x) \u2227 \u00acW(x)) - Some teachers are not wealthy\n\nNow let's analyze each possible conclusion:\n\nA) Some teachers are not doctors: \u2203x(T(x) \u2227 \u00acD(x))\nFrom statement 2, we know there exists at least one person who is a teacher and not wealthy. Let's call this person 'p'.\nSo, T(p) \u2227 \u00acW(p) is true.\nFrom statement 1, we know that all doctors are wealthy, which is equivalent to saying if someone is not wealthy, then they are not a doctor: \u2200x(\u00acW(x) \u2192 \u00acD(x)).\nSince p is not wealthy (\u00acW(p)), we can conclude that p is not a doctor (\u00acD(p)).\nTherefore, T(p) \u2227 \u00acD(p) is true, which means \"Some teachers are not doctors\" is valid.\n\nB) No teachers are doctors: \u2200x(T(x) \u2192 \u00acD(x)) or equivalently \u00ac\u2203x(T(x) \u2227 D(x))\nThis is stronger than conclusion A and doesn't necessarily follow from the given statements. The statements don't rule out the possibility that some teachers who are wealthy could also be doctors.\n\nC) Some doctors are teachers: \u2203x(D(x) \u2227 T(x))\nNothing in the given statements implies this must be true.\n\nD) All wealthy people are doctors: \u2200x(W(x) \u2192 D(x))\nThis is not implied by the given statements. Statement 1 tells us all doctors are wealthy, but not the converse.\n\nTherefore, only conclusion A can be validly deduced from the given statements."
