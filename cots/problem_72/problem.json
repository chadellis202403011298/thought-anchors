  "question": "Consider this letter sequence: A, E, I, M, Q, ?\nWhat letter should replace the question mark? Explain your reasoning.",
  "answer": "The correct letter is U.\n\nStep 1: Convert each letter to its position in the alphabet:\nA = 1\nE = 5\nI = 9\nM = 13\nQ = 17\n? = ?\n\nStep 2: Analyze the pattern between consecutive letters:\n5 - 1 = 4\n9 - 5 = 4\n13 - 9 = 4\n17 - 13 = 4\n\nStep 3: I notice that each letter is 4 positions ahead of the previous letter in the alphabet.\n\nStep 4: To find the next letter, I add 4 to the position of Q:\n17 + 4 = 21\n\nStep 5: The letter corresponding to position 21 is U.\n\nTherefore, the next letter in the sequence is U."
