  "question": "In a classroom of 35 students, each student is assigned a student ID number from 1 to 99. Prove that there must be at least two different students whose ID numbers add up to 100.",
  "answer": "I'll tackle this problem using the Pigeonhole Principle.\n\nStep 1: Let's identify the 'pigeons' and 'holes' in this problem.\n- We have 35 students (pigeons)\n- Each student has an ID number from 1 to 99\n\nStep 2: Consider pairs of numbers that sum to 100:\n(1, 99), (2, 98), (3, 97), ..., (49, 51), (50, 50)\n\nStep 3: Count these pairs. Since the pair (50, 50) requires the same number, we need to count it as a special case.\nFor numbers 1 through 49, we have pairs: (1, 99), (2, 98), ..., (49, 51)\nThat's 49 pairs, plus the special case (50, 50), which counts as one additional possibility.\n\nStep 4: So there are 50 distinct pairs of numbers that sum to 100.\n\nStep 5: Now, we can apply the Pigeonhole Principle. If we had 50 or fewer students with ID numbers, we couldn't conclusively prove there's a pair summing to 100. However, with 35 students, we need to determine if we can avoid having a pair that sums to 100.\n\nStep 6: To avoid having any pair of ID numbers that sum to 100, we can select at most one number from each of the 50 pairs we identified. This means we could have at most 50 students with no pair summing to 100.\n\nStep 7: Since we have 35 students (which is less than 50), it might seem like we could avoid having a pair that sums to 100. However, the key insight is that each student's ID number can participate in multiple pairs.\n\nStep 8: Consider the complementary pairs: for each ID number x, there exists exactly one other number (100-x) that would form a pair summing to 100.\n\nStep 9: Among our 35 students, the maximum number of complementary pairs we could avoid is 35. Since there are 99 possible ID numbers, and each student takes one, we've assigned 35 out of 99 possible numbers.\n\nStep 10: By the Pigeonhole Principle, if we have more than 99/2 = 49.5 (so 50 or more) ID numbers assigned, then we must have at least one pair that sums to 100. But with 35 students, we don't reach this threshold.\n\nStep 11: However, the correct application of the Pigeonhole Principle here is to consider pairs of numbers as the \"holes\". There are 50 pairs of numbers that sum to 100. If we have more than 50 students, then by the Pigeonhole Principle, at least two students must have ID numbers from the same pair, which would sum to 100.\n\nStep 12: Since we only have 35 students, this approach doesn't immediately yield our result.\n\nStep 13: The key insight: We need to consider the contrapositive. Suppose no two students have ID numbers that sum to 100. Then each student must have an ID number that forms a pair with an ID number that no student has.\n\nStep 14: This means each of our 35 students' ID numbers has a corresponding number (100 minus that ID) that cannot be assigned. So 35 numbers are used, and 35 numbers are forbidden, totaling 70 numbers.\n\nStep 15: Since there are only 99 possible ID numbers, and 70 are either used or forbidden, there are only 99 - 70 = 29 remaining numbers available.\n\nStep 16: But we have 35 students, and 35 > 29, which is a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, by the Pigeonhole Principle, there must be at least two students whose ID numbers add up to 100."
