  "question": "Three independent studies investigated the effect of a new meditation technique on reducing stress levels. The studies reported the following results:\n\nStudy 1: 100 participants, average stress reduction of 15%, p-value = 0.08\nStudy 2: 50 participants, average stress reduction of 20%, p-value = 0.04\nStudy 3: 75 participants, average stress reduction of 12%, p-value = 0.06\n\nBased on these results, which of the following conclusions is most appropriate from a meta-analytical perspective?\n\nA) The meditation technique is ineffective because the largest study (Study 1) failed to reach statistical significance.\nB) The meditation technique is effective because the average stress reduction across all studies is substantial.\nC) The meditation technique shows promising but mixed results, with a trend toward effectiveness that would benefit from a properly weighted meta-analysis.\nD) The meditation technique is definitely effective because Study 2 showed statistical significance.",
  "answer": "The correct answer is C) The meditation technique shows promising but mixed results, with a trend toward effectiveness that would benefit from a properly weighted meta-analysis.\n\nReasoning process:\n\n1. First, we need to analyze the individual study results:\n   - Study 1: Large sample (100), moderate effect (15%), but not statistically significant (p = 0.08)\n   - Study 2: Small sample (50), largest effect (20%), statistically significant (p = 0.04)\n   - Study 3: Medium sample (75), smallest effect (12%), not statistically significant (p = 0.06)\n\n2. Option A is incorrect because we cannot base our conclusion solely on the largest study. Meta-analysis specifically combines evidence from multiple studies rather than prioritizing a single study.\n\n3. Option B is incorrect because it makes a definitive claim based only on the average effect size without properly accounting for statistical significance, sample sizes, or conducting a formal meta-analysis.\n\n4. Option D is incorrect because it cherry-picks the single significant study while ignoring the two non-significant studies. This violates the principles of meta-analysis.\n\n5. Option C is correct because:\n   - It acknowledges the mixed nature of the results (one significant, two non-significant)\n   - It recognizes the consistent direction of effect (all studies show some stress reduction)\n   - It notes that p-values in Studies 1 and 3 (0.08 and 0.06) are close to the conventional significance threshold (0.05)\n   - It appropriately calls for a formal meta-analysis that would weight studies by sample size and precision\n\nA proper meta-analysis would likely give more weight to Study 1 (largest sample) and less weight to Study 2 (smallest sample), potentially yielding a more definitive conclusion about the overall effectiveness of the meditation technique."
